I DON T REALLY LIKE THE BUTTON/KNOB LAYOUT ON THE CENTER CONSOLE 
  CD PLAYER 
 A PILLAR IS HARD TO SEE AROUND AT AN INTERSECTION
 A PILLARS OBSTRUCT SIDE VIEW A LITTLE TOO MUCH
 AUTOMATIC HIGH/LOW BEAMS
 BETTER VOICE CONTROL ONLINE NAVIGATION MAP UPDATES HAVING 4G INSTEAD OF 3G 
 CAR NEXT TO YOU LIGHT ON SIDE MIRROR HELPS WITH SIDE BLIND SPOTS
 CONNECTED APPLICATIONS RUNNING ON THE PHONE ARE NOT PRACTICAL IT SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO KEEP THE APPLICATION IN THE FOREGROUND ON THE PHONE WHY CAN T THE CAR READ RECEIVED TEXT OR ALLOW ME TO DICTATE NEW TEXTS? THIS SEEMS LIKE A MUST HAVE 
 FUN FACTOR
 GOOD I VE BEEN TOLD BY FAMILY AND FRIENDS THE BACK SEATS GIVE THEM GOOD VISIBILITY OF THE OUTSIDE 
 JERKY SHIFTING
 NAVIGATION W/ TRAFFIC IS NOT OPTIMAL AND GENERALLY INACCURATE COMPARED TO GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE SUGGEST USE GOOGLE MAPS FOR NAVIGATION IPHONE CAN ONLY BE USED WITH EITHER USB OR BLUETOOTH THERE SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC SWITCH BETWEEN THE 2 
 REAL 4WD
 REAR WINDSHIELD COULD HAVE BEEN BIGGER/LARGER
 STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS NEED A NEXT/BACK BUTTON FOR AUDIO CONTROLS SOUND QUALITY TO AND FROM THE HANDS FREE CALLING COULD USE A LITTLE MORE CLARITY BOTH IN THE CAR AND FROM THE CAR TO THE OTHER LINE POWER OUTLETS 12V AND USB SHOULD 
 SUN VISOR PULLS DOWN AT A WEIRD ANGLE HARD TO SEE OTHER CARS FROM DRIVER SEAT WHEN LOOKING RIGHT
 TANK FEELING
 THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OFTEN DRIVES ME THROUGH LONGER ROUTES THAN EXPECTED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OFTEN DRIVES ME THROUGH LOCAL ROADS INSTEAD OF HIGHWAYS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD TRAFFIC INFORMATION SYSTEM REALLY SMALL COVER 
 THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE BURMESTER HIGH END SYSTEM!
 THIS IS MY SECOND 435I MY FIRST WAS TOTALED AND THE ARE SAFETY AND STABILITY SAVED MY LIFE SO I BOUGHT THE SAME CAR
 VERY GOOD HAVE TO LEARN MORE HAVEN T DROVE IT A LOT AA OF YET 
$ 70 000 DOLLAR CAR DOES NOT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM UNLESS YOU PAY $600 DOLLARS EXTRA TO HAVE IT ACTIVATED MOST CARS WAY LESS THAN HALF OF THE PRICE WILL COME FROM THE FACTORY WITH BUILT IN NAVIGATION AT NO EXTRA COST!!!!!!!
$70 000 SUV AND DONT HAVE AS STANDAR REAR CAMERA FORWARD COLLISION WARNING THIS NOT A LUXURY ITS SAFETY FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS 
/BEING ABLE TO USE VOICE TO CHANGE STATIONS OR GET DIRECTIONS
? IS THERE A WAY TO KEEP THE REAR CAMERA ON ALL THE TIME ?
?FEEL AS THOUGH THE REARVIEW MIRROR EITHER DISTORTS OR IS AT AWKWARD PREDEFINED ANGLE TO LOOK OUT THE BACK WINDOW EVEN WITH ADJUSTING THE MIRROR THE VIEW SEEMS FOR LACK OF AN ACTUAL TERM LIKE A FUNHOUSE MIRROR SORT OF 
[SEE SPECIFICATION OF OTHER IN PREVIOUS SECTION ]
^THE VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE BETTER
1 APPLE SHOULD DESIGN BECAUSE IT IS NOT INTUITIVE 2 THE SALESMAN GAVE ME A VERY BRIEF TUTORIAL WHEN THE CAR CAME IN IT WAS VERY BRIEF EITHER GIVE A CLASS OR MAKE THE SYSTEM INTUITIVE 
1 ARM REST
1 BLIND SPOT LEFT TURN
1 BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM NEEDS OPTIONAL SWITCH TO ALLOW BEEPS EVERY TIME BLIND SPOT LIGHT TURNS ON 2 BLIND SPOT LOOK ANGLE NEEDS TO BE TWICE AS LARGE AS CURRENT FACTORY SET ANGLE I KEEP ENCOUNTERING CARS THAT THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM DOE 
1 BLUETOOTH AUDIO TAKES TOO LONG TO CONNECT AND STREAM 2 VOICE SYSTEM IS TOO CHATTY AND LACKS SHORTCUTS LIKE PRESSING DIAL TO DIAL INSTEAD OF THE PAINFUL ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO CALL THE PERSON YOU JUST TOLD ME TO CALL AND YOU SPOKE TOO SOON 
1 BLUETOOTH MOBILE PHONE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT MAYBE RELOCATE MIC LOCATION 2 IT WOULD BE NICE FOR THIS VEHICLE TO COME WITH FACTORY INSTALLED NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
1 DUAL SUN VISORS FOR DRIVER AND PASSENGER 2 REDESIGN REAR FOR BETTER AIR FLOW REAR WINDOW GETS DIRTIER THAN ANY VEHICLE I VE DRIVEN
1 ENGINE NOISE IS A LITTLE LOUDER THAN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED WHEN QUICKLY ACCELERATING ON TO A HIGHWAY 2 AUTOMATIC CHOKE REVS TO HIGH ON COOL MORNING STARTS WILL GET ADJUSTED NEXT MAINTENANCE DAY 
1 ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM THERE ARE NO BUILT IN APPS IN THE CAR TO GET TO INTERNET APPS YOU MUST USE YOUR CELL PHONE WHICH IS UNACCEPTABLE 2 NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT IS INACCURATE WITH REGARD TO FINDING DESTINATIONS AND IS CONFUSING TO USE 3 
1 FASTER PROCESSOR IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG TO RESPOND TO MY VOICE COMMANDS AND MY TOUCH SCREEN SELECTIONS 2 REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TOUCHES IT TAKES TO BEGIN NAVIGATING TO AN ADDRESS OR POI 3 ADD STARBUCKS TO THE POI LIST
1 HEADLIGHT HIGH BEAMS ARE NOT VERY BRIGHT 2 WE ALSO WISH THE RADIO/NAVIGATION DISPLAY HAD A SEPARATE DIMMER CONTROL FROM THE DASH IT S TOO BRIGHT AT NIGHT OR THE DASH IT TOO DIM IT HAS AN OFF CAPABILITY BUT THEN ONE CAN NOT SEE THE TIME OR 
1 I AM UNABLE TO SWITCH RADIO BANDS AM FM SATELLITE AND/OR FUNCTIONS RADIO CD FROM THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS 2 I SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE VOICE COMMANDS TO SWITCH RADIO BANDS AND FUNCTIONS AND STATIONS 
1 IT IS EASY TO SELECT PRE PROGRAMMED RADIO CHANNELS WHILE DRIVING BUT DIFFICULT IF THE STATION IS NOT PRE PROGRAMMED THIS INCLUDES SWITCHING TO A STATION S HD CHANNEL AND 2 IT IS NOT THE EASIEST TO ADJUST THE SOUND CONTROL WHILE DRIVING 
1 MAKE SOFT BUTTONS CHANGEABLE FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD PREFER THAT ONE BUTTON LEAD DIRECTLY TO AUDIO RATHER THAN APPS I RARELY USE APPS MOVING BACK TO AUDIO FROM PHONE TAKES MULTIPLE STEPS 2 VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAV DOESN T SEEM TO WORK 
1 NAVIGATION AND RADIO CANT BE SEEN AT THE SAME TIME 2 OFTEN WHEN I PUT IN A NEW DESTINATION IT TELLS ME TO PROCEED TO A PARTICULAR ROAD BUT IT IS USUALLY THE SECOND ROAD I NEED I DON T ALWAYS KNOW WHERE TO GO TO GET TO THAT ROAD USUALLY IT 
1 NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS MORE DIFFICULT TO READ STREETS COMPARED TO OUR OTHER CAR LEXUS 2 TRAFFIC ALERTS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO READ COMPARED TO OTHER CAR LEXUS 
1 NEITHER THE VOICE RECOGNITION NOR THE MANUAL ENTERING OF ADDRESSES IN THE NAV SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD BOTH ARE VERY CLUMSY MY IPHONE IS 10 TIMES A GOOD 2 BLUETOOTH AUDIO INTEGRATION WITH SPOTIFY IS MARGIN AS BEST CAN T USE STEERING CONTROLS T 
1 OPTION TO ALLOW AUTOMATIC SETTING TO DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME AND DISABLING DST AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES IN THE YEAR 2 BE ABLE TO EASILY AND SAFELY SHUT OFF ROUTE GUIDANCE IN NAVIGATION WHILE DRIVING 3 BE ABLE TO EASILY AND SAFELY ADJUST VOLU 
1 SHOULD HAVE TELESCOPING STEERING WHEEL 2 SHOULD HAVE INDEPENDENT CONTROL OF DRIVER SEAT CUSHION AND BACK REST IE 8 WAY SEATS 3 NO BUILT IN DEVICE TO OPEN GARAGE DOOR
1 SONY SPEAKERS ARE JUST AVERAGE AT BEST 2 IMPROVE MY FORD SYNC USER INTERFACE
1 THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT IS NOT ANY WORSE THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR WHICH DID NOT HAVE A BACK UP CAMERA WHICH IS NORMAL NOWADAYS IT SEEMS HOWEVER IT IS AN AREA THAT I WISH ALL VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS WOULD TRY TO IMPROVE 2 I W 
1 THE SOUND QUALITY CAN IMPROVE THE VOLUME SETTING IS TOO LOW I NEED TO PUT IT UP TO ABOUT 30 FOR AVERAGE SOUND 2 WHEN MY PHONE IS CONNECTED TO GOOGLE MAPS THE BLUETOOTH SYNCS WITH MY PHONE AND THE DISPLAY CHANGES TO AS IF I M MAKING A PHONE 
1 TO 2X S PER MONTH THE SYSTEM WILL DROP MY BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WITH MY PHONE 
1 TOUCHSCREEN! IT S A PITA PAIN IN THE A$$ ENTERING AN ADDRESS OR ANYTHING ELSE AS COMPARED TO MOST OTHER 2014+ VEHICLES 2 SOFT KEYS! I HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH MULTIPLE ITEMS TO GET TO MY PRE SETS WHY? SEE THE HYUNDAI GENESIS SYSTEM FOR 
1 VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM HAS TO UNDERSTAND MORE DIVERSE SPEAKING ACCENTS & STYLES IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE MY COMMANDS I AM AN ASIAN INDIAN 2 ALL OPTIONS OF AUDIO / ENTERTAINMENT ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN A SINGLE COMMAND SYSTEM I HAVE TO TOGGLE BETW 
1 WOULD BE NICE IF IT SHOWED THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT WITHIN DRIVER S EASY VIEW RATHER THAN A SMALL SYMBOL ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN 2 WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BLIND SPOT PROTECTION WARNING IN SIDE MIRRORS 
1 YR OF SATELLITE RADIO SHOULD BE INCLUDED 
10 AIR BAGS WOW WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY! I FEEL AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE 
10 NO FOLDING SIDE MIROR 2 LEFT SIDE MIRROR BLOCKS VIEW WHEN MAKING A TIGHT LEFT TURN INTO AN ENTRY PARKING SPACE OR DRIVEWAY ENTRY

2 SCREEN SYSTEM IS CONFUSING
2 STAR SAFETY RATING IN BACKSEAT
2 STEP PROCESS TO CHANGE RADIO STATION DISLIKE
2 THINGS SORRY NO HD RADIO CAN T BELIEVE IT THE VOICE COMMAND STRUCTURE FOR TRYING TO FIND PLACES SUCK 
2 THINGS+++++MAKE THE INFO SYSTEM MORE USER FRIENDLY AND EASIER TO HANDLE MAKE THE VOICE RECOGNITION MORE USER FRIENDLY ABLE TO UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WITH ACCENTS/LISPSS/ETC
2 WHEEL DRIVE
2008 NAVIGATIONS WAS MUCH BETTER THE MIDDLE CONTROL ONCE IN TRAVEL WORKS POORLY PREFER TO BE ABLE TO US THE SYSTEM WHEN IN MOTION WITH VOICE TALK BACK FOR LETTERS ETC 
2015 AND NO CD???
2015 RDX DOES NOT COMES WITH LANE CHANGE ASSIST WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL ALSO DOES NOT HAVE SENSOR IN REAR A BEEP SOUND ONE SOMETHING IS CLOSE BY WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL THESE ARE BASIC FEATURE IN THE YEAR 2010+ AND SADLY MISSING IN 2015 MO 
2015S WEREN T BUILT WITH THE SONAR LIKE THE SANTA FE WAS

2ND ROW MIDDLE CONSOLE WISH IT WAS REMOVABLE
2ND ROW SEATING SPACING
2ND ROW SEATSDO NOT STOW COMNPLETELY FLAT

370Z HAS BLIND SPOTS AS DID THE 350Z ALSO BUT THE DRIVER CAN ADJUST AND USE THE AIDS PROVIDED 
3D EFFECT OF THE MAP AND THE ADVANCE WARNING OF DIRECTIONS TO ACT 
3D MAP DISPLAY DOES NOT LOOK FORWARD ENOUGH I MUCH PREFER THE RER NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE 2009 WRANGLE I HAD PREVIOUSLY ALSO WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND COLORS HIWAYS ON THE MAP YELLOW AND GREEN THE SAME COLORS USED BY THE TRAFFIC NOTIFICATI 
3D NAV MAPS COULD USE MORE DETAIL
3D ROW SIDE WINDOWS ARE TOO NARROW OLDER SEDONA HAD A WIDER SIDE BACK WINDOWS BETTER VISIBILITY BACK WINDOW OF NEW SEDONA IS TOO NARROW TOO 
3G CONNECTION IS TOO SLOW NEED AT LEAST LTE 
3G CONNECTION SOMETIMES NOT FAST ENOUGH TO STREAM VIDEO
3G COULD WORK BETTER OVERALL OTHER THAN THE INTERNET CONNECTION IT IS GREAT 
3G SIM CARD
3G WIRELESS CONNECTION IS SLOW SHOULD HAVE UTILIZED 4G LTE
3RD KIA THE LANE CHANGE ALARM IS HUGE FOR BLIND SPOT ISSUE
3RD ROW ACCESS/LEG ROOM
3RD ROW HEAD REST COULD BE LITTLE MORE SMALLER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
3RD ROW HEADRESTS BLOCK VIEW
3RD ROW HEADRESTS MAKE SEEING OUT REAR WINDOW VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE

A 10 YEAR OLD COULD HAVE PROGRAMMED THIS SYSTEM BETTER ABSOLUTELY COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT I AM A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND I HAVE ESTIMATED TO HAVE EXPERIENCED OVER 100 DIFFERENT BUGS WITH THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM IT IS ALMOST UNUSABLE AND WILL D 
A 2015 CAR THAT COMES WITH AN APPLE CONNECTOR THAT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED FOR TWO YEARS VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM MORE TROUBLE THAN ITS WORTH FINDING POINTS OF INTEREST ON THE NAV SYSTEM IS SLOW INTERNET HOT SPOT WITH T MOBILE MUCH MUCH SLOWER THAN 
A 2015 CHARGER SHOULD BE STOCKED WITH NAVIGATION AND REAR VIEW VISUAL CAPABILITIES FOR THE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE THAT S ALMOST EXPECTED WITH THE CAR
A 25K AMERICAN CAR HAS MORE ADVANCE/HI TECH ELECTRONIC DISPLAY NOW DAYS!!
A ADD A VOLUME KNOB THE CAPACITIVE ? TOUCH ON THE DISPLAY ARE HARD FOR PASSENGERS TO ADJUST B ADDING AN ERGONOMIC PLACE TO REST PART OF THE HAND CAN STEADY THE HAND AND ALLOW FOR EASIER USE OF THE TOUCH SCREEN IF A RAISED PLACE WAS ON THE 
A AND B PILLAR BLIND SPOTS AND THE REAR WINDOW IS TOO SMALL FOR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING UP 
A BACK UP CAMERA WAS INSTALLED DUE TO THE LACK OF VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING THE JEEP UP 
A BACKUP CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY LARGE VEHICLES OUT THERE IT S HARD TO SEE PAST THEM A BACKUP CAMERA WOULD DEFINITELY HELP 
A BACKUP CAMERA WOULD BE NICE
A BAD BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES THANKFULLY I HAVE THE LANE DEPARTURE SYSTEM 
A BASIC SYSTEM I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF TOUCHSCREEN OR NAVIGATION BUTTONS TO USE THE AUDIO SYSTEM IT IS MOSTLY VOLUME AND TUNER THAT IS GREAT 
A BETTER DISPLAY SUCH AS A HIGH DEFINITION DISPLAY
A BETTER EXPLAINATION OF HOW TO USE IT I AM NOT FAMILIER WITH SOME TECHNOLOGY I LIKE THE VOICE CONNECTION AND HAVE USED IT ONLY ONCE I ALSO MADE A CALL FROM THE CAR TO MY HOME PHONE ONCE WITH SUCCESS SOMETIMES IT SHOWS MY PHONE AS CONNECTED 
A BETTER FILE NAVATION SYSTEM WOULD BE HELPFUL
A BETTER FRONT SEAT HOLDER LOCATION THAT DOESN T BLOCK THE USB PORT LOCATION
A BETTER MENU SYSTEM FOR CHANGING SETTINGS ETC
A BETTER NAVIGATION GUIDANCE FASTER TOUCH SCREEN RESPONSE AS VIEWING THE MAP
A BETTER SOUND EQUALIZER
A BETTER SOUND QUALITY AND PRE PROGRAMMED EQUALIZER THAT IS AVAILABLE ON OTHER GM MODELS
A BETTER SPEAKER SOUND SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE LIKE BOSE
A BETTER SUB WOOFER FRONT MIDDLE SPEAKER SOUNDS FLAT WITH A 900 WATT SYSTEM DRIVING 17 SPEAKERS IT SHOULD BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF IT S MEDIOCRE AT BEST 
A BETTER SURROUND SPEAKER SYSTEM TO HEAR WHEN WINDOWS ARE OPEN
A BETTER SYNC WITH EXTERNAL MP3 IPHONE IN MY CASE THAT DISPLAY MORE OF MY PHONE S SCREEN I E ALBUM COVERS IT IS MY FIRST BLUETOOTH EXPERIENCE SO I M NOT SURE IF THERE S ALWAY A LAG 
A BETTER TUTORIAL ON USE OF ALL SYSTEMS DESIGN THE CENTER DISPLAY SO IT FACES THE DRIVER 
A BIG FACTOR IN THE DRIVING SAFETY IS THE FORWARD VISIBILITY FOR MY WIFE WHEN SHE DRIVES SINCE SHE IS ONLY 5 FEET TALL THIS AS WELL AS OUR FAVORABLE EXPERIENCE WITH OUR 2005 PRIUS FOR 10 YEARS WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN CHOOSING TO BUY A PRIUS V AFTE 
A BIG FRONT END SEEMS NOSE HEAVY 
A BIGGER SCREEN WOULD BE NICE
A BIGGER VEHICLE ALWAYS SEEMS A LITTLE SCARIER TO DRIVE HOWEVER I LOVE HOW THE QUEST DRIVES LIKE A HUGE SPORTS CAR KUDOS ON BUILDING IT UPON THE GT R 
A BIT BETTER QUALITY SPEAKERS 
A BIT COMPLICATED AND THE THING I USE THE MOST PHONE VIA VOICE DIALING IS FAIRLY KLUDGY CONNECTIVITY WITH BLUETOOTH IS LESS RELIABLE THAN IT SHOULD BE
A BIT COMPLICATED TO OPERATE FOR MY WIFE 
A BIT DATED
A BIT DIFFICULT SEEING OVER THE NOSE OF THE VEHICLE UNLESS DRIVER S SEAT IS ADJUSTED AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE THEN HEAD ROOM BECOMES AN ISSUE SMALL VIEWING AREA OUT BACK GLASS HEIGHT OF THIRD ROW SEATS RESTRICT VIEW 
A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF BACK WINDOW
A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT READ AND SIDE WINDOWS ESP SIDE RIGHT
A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE OVER DRIVERS LEFT SHOULDER TO BLIND SPOT THE REAR VIEW WINDOW WOULD BE BETTER IF A LITTLE WIDER 
A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES AT THE BACK WHEN CHANGING LANES
A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES BLIND SPOT OUT OF BACK DOOR AREA 
A BIT HARD TO FIGURE IT ALL OUT 
A BIT HARD TO SEE RIGHT REAR BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ADDRESS A LOT BUT COULD BE BETTER 
A BIT HARD TO SEE WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER AT REAR PASSENGER SIDE 
A BIT HARD TO USE 
A BIT OF A CHALLENGE SEEING YOUR BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES
A BIT OF CONFUSING ON VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES USING CAMERA VIEW
A BIT TIGHT INSIDE
A BIT TRICKY TO RECOGNIZE BLUETOOTH DEVICES 
A BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVER S SIDE LOOKING TO THE RIGHT
A BLIND SPOT IS CREATED BY THE PILLARS BETWEEN THE FRONT DOOR AND WINDSHIELD THE ANGLE AND WIDTH OF THE PILLARS COVER A SIGNIFICANT AREA 
A BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM IS A MUST WITH THIS VEHICLE
A BLIND SPOT ON BOTH SIDES OF CAR
A BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE I DO HAVE ONE THROUGH ON STAR BUT IS HARD TO USE AND REQUIRES AN ADDITIONAL FEE 
A CAMERA ON THE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR WOULD HELP IN CHANGING LANES VERSE THE WARNING ICON IN THE SIDE MIRROR 
A CAMERA SYSTEM THAT WOULD DISPLAY A FRONT VIEW AND A VEHICLE PERIPHERY VIEW WOULD BE A GREAT ASSET FOR PARKING AN INFRA RED OR RADAR LIKE SYSTEM WOULD BE GREAT TO ENHANCE NIGHT DRIVING SAFETY
A CAR LIKE THIS SHOULD HAVE A GREAT LIGHTING PACKAGE IT S BELOW AVERAGE 
A CAR THAT COSTS THIS MUCH SHOULD HAVE BLUETOOTH MUSIC STREAMING BUILT IN 
A CD PLAYER GOT MANY CDS NOW HAVE PUT ON SD CARD TO LISTEN 2 THEM WHY ? THE 14S HAD CD PLAYER
A CD PLAYER WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE
A CENTRAL COMMAND KNOB WOULD BE NICE SOMETHING LIKE THE BMW IDRIVE SYSTEM AS THE TOUCH SCREEN IS TOO DISTRACTING TO USE SAFELY WHILE DRIVING 
A CLEAR EXPLANATION OF HOW TO CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO THE CAR
A COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM WOULD BE A GOOD ADDITION
A COMPASS
A COMPASS WOULD BE NICE 
A CONCISE QUICK START GUIDE FOR THE BLUETOOTH AND THE NAVIGATION
A COUPLE OF BLIND SPOTS WHEN PASSING BUT THE BACKUP CAMERA HAS ME REALLY SPOILED 
A COUPLE OF REAR BLIND SPOTS
A COUPLE OF TIMES I HAVE NOT SEEN CARS COMING FROM THE RIGHT EVEN AFTER LOOKING CAREFULLY I M NOT SURE IF IT IS A BLIND SPOT OR ME 
A CRISPIER SOUND FOR THE MUSIC AND ANSWERING THE PHONE 
A DEER HIT ME SOON AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR THIS WAS TREMENDOUS DAMAGE TO THE FRONT BUMPER BUT MY TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS AND I WERE FINE AND FELT COMPLETELY SAFE THROUGH IT ALL
A DIGITAL SPEEDOMETER WOULD REALLY HELP WHEN USING CRUISE CONTROL
A DISPLAY THAT IS EASIER TO SEE 
A DRIVER SHOULDN T SCROLL THROUGH THE TOUCH SCREEN OF RADIO STATIONS THERE S TOO MANY BUTTONS AND THEY RE HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE WITHOUT FOCUSING MORE CLOSELY 
A FAMILY THOUGHT THE WRANGLER WAS UNSAFE TO DRIVE ONE RIDE IN IT AND SHE QUICKLY CHANGED HER MIND SHE FELT SAFE AND ENJOYED THE RIDE NOW SHE IS IN LOVE WITH IT 
A FASTER ANIMATION WHEN CHANGING PAGES OF PRESET RADIO CHANNELS WOULD BE NICE CAN BE SLUGGISH 
A FASTER USER INTERFACE 
A FEW TIMES I HAVE ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE SEEK BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL WHILE PARKING IT PERHAPS COULD BE PUT IN A DIFFERENT PLACE ON THE WHEEL 
A FINE DRIVING CAR
A FOLD DOWN NAV SCREEN WOULD BE WELCOMED AND THE DIRECTION OF THE DIALS USE IN COUNTERINTUITIVE TO THE STATES 
A FRAME POST ARE AS IN ANY VEHICLE TAKE ADJUSTING YOUR CHECKING FOR PEDESTRIANS CROSSING 
A FREE TRIAL OF SYNC SERVICES WOULD GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY ALL OF MY CARS FEATURES I HAVE NO CLUE HOW MY CARS NAVIGATION SYSTEM WORKS BECAUSE ITS A $60 FEE TO TURN IT ON 
A FRONT SEATED PASSENGER CANNOT CONTROL THE NAV UNIT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION! THAT S UNACCEPTABLE TO ME!
A FRONT SENSOR SYSTEM WOULD BE HELPFUL 
A FRONT VIEW CAMERA WOULD BE NICE TOO TO TOGGLE OFF / ON WHEN NEEDED THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL SO WHY NOT PUT ONE FOR THE FRONT VIEW AND ALLOW THE DRIVER TO TURN OFF/ON AS NEEDED 
A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT 
A HEADS UP DISPLAY WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR MY MODEL CYCLE WHICH I WOULD HAVE LIKED MY BMW HAS ONE AND ITS GREAT 
A HEARING PROBLEM PREVENTS MY FROM HEARING THE PROMPT FORM THE AUTOMATED FEATURE THE TONE OF THE BEEP IS OUT OF MY RANGE OF HEARING A LIGHT ON THE DASH WITH THE BEEP WOULD REMEDY THIS PROBLEM IT IS A LOT OF TROUBLE TO INPUT ADDRESSES INTO 
A HUGE NEGATIVE IS THE LACK OF THE SET SPEED LIMIT IN THE ZONE I M DRIVING IN WHERE ALL THE SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD HAVE THEM NOW NO TEXT MSG READING OR DICTATION OPTION VERY LIMITED APPS AND CAN NOT BE CUSTOMIZED LACK OF WIFI OPTION IN THIS PRICE 
A I LOVE ALL OF THE FEATURES AVAILABLE TO ME AS YOU CAN SEE BY MY ANSWERS I HAVEN T REALLY HAD AS MUCH CHANCE TO LEARN AND USE ALL OF THEM YET I THINK RATINGS MAY EVEN BE A BIT HIGHER IF I HAD HAD A CHANCE TO USE PANDORA AND SOME OF THE OTHER O
A KEYBOARD FOR INPUTTING ADDRESSES 
A LARGER DISPLAY SCREEN WOULD BE GREAT
A LARGER HEAVIER VEHICLE PROVIDES A SENSE OF CONFIDENCE SHOULD I ENCOUNTER A MISHAP AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS THESE MISHAPS OCCUR FREQUENTLY ON THE RURAL HIGHWAY THAT CONSTITUTES THE PREPONDERANCE OF MY DRIVING 
A LARGER HI RES TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE GREAT THE TOUCH SCREEN IS LOW RES AND A BIT SMALL 
A LEVEL VEHICLE WOULD ALLOW BETTER REAR VIEW 
A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE INTO BLIND SPOT AREAS MONITORING SYSTEM IS VERY USEFUL AND RECOMMENDED TO BE STANDARD
A LITTLE BIT OF A BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVERS SEAT LOOKING THROUGH SIDE REAR WINDOW FOR TRAFFIC 
A LITTLE BLIND SPOT IN FRONT BETWEEN FRONT AND SIDE WINDOWS
A LITTLE DIFFICULT CHECKING LEFT SIDE REAR DURING PASSING
A LITTLE DIFFICULT LOOKING BACKWARD TO THE LEFT WHEN I PULL OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT ON YOUR OWN MANUAL IS VERY HELPFUL THOUGH 
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO MAKE TURNS HAVE HARD TIME LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDERS FOR LANE CHANGES DO T REPLY ON MIRRORS
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO PROGRAM STATIONS AND CLEAR UNWANTED STATIONS
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS IN BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS ON PASSENGER REAR SIDE
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOWS THE CAMERA HELPS ALSO HARD TO SEE THE LOCK/UNLOCK BUTTONS ON THE DRIVER SIDE PANEL 
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT REAR WINDOWS WHEN BACKING UP 
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE REAR VIEW OF RIGHT LANE WHEN DRIVING DUE TO HEADRESTS ON SECOND ROW SEATS 
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE UP AND OVER BACK DASHBOARD WHEN BACKING UP REAR VIEW CAMERA IS NICE PLUS THOUGH 
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE SHAKER STEREO PAID EXTRA MONEY FOR IT AND THE SOUND IS NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED IT TO BE 
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE SOUND QUALITY FROM SPEAKER SYSTEM 
A LITTLE DISTRACTING LOOKING OUT BEHIND THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR WINDOW
A LITTLE EASIER FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND VOICE RECOGNITION
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES BUT WITH BLIND SPOT WARNING I DON T WORRY ABOUT IT 
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE IN BACK AND ON SIDES WHILE DRIVING SO THE WARNING SYSTEMS ARE ESSENTIAL ESPECIALLY THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OUT OF FRONT SIDE WINDOWS
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE SIDE BACK WINDOW
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK SIDES WHEN PULLING OUT OF PARKING BUT I HAVE FOUND THIS TO BE THE CASE IN EVERY VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED THAT WASN T A LARGE SUV
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OVER THE HOOD WHEN PARKING 
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE THE BLIND SPOTS BUT THIS IS MADE UP FOR BY THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION 
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE WHEN MAKING CORNER PAST POST
A LITTLE HARD TO USE AND LOCATED A BIT TOO FAR FROM THE DRIVER
A LITTLE HARDER TO SEE REAR VISIBILITY 
A LITTLE MORE SIMPLE TO OPERATE 
A LITTLE MORE TRUCK LIKE THAN MY VOLVO XC90 BUT FOR ITS SIZE HANDLING IS VERY GOOD
A LITTLE MORE USER FRIENDLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT HIGH TECH
A LITTLE ROUGH ON BUMPS
A LITTLE TOO COMPLICATED TO USE SO DO NOT USE AS OFTEN AS I WOULD LIKE TO
A LITTLE TRICKY TO NAVIGATE MENUS AT FIRST BUT ONCE IT S FIGURED OUT NOT TOO BAD
A LITTLE TROUBLE GETTING USED TO SMALLER MIRROR USED TO DRIVE A TRUCK 
A LOT EASIER TO OPERATE THAN EARLIER SUBARU MODELS
A LOT MORE ROAD NOSIE THAN I AM USED TO
A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS 
A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS THAT YOU NEED TO LEARN TO NAVIGATE I CAME FROM AN SUV WITH NO BLIND SPOTS TO A CAR WITH BLIND SPOTS AND ITS TAKEN SOME BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION TO GET USED TO A CAR AGAIN 
A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS THROUGH THE POSTS WHEN TURNING
A LOT OF BLIND STOPS 
A LOT OF BLINDSPOTS WHEN YOU GO TO CHANGE LANES ALMOST BEEN HIT
A LOT OF BUTTON BUT PREFER BUTTONS OVER KNOBS
A LOT OF CARS ARE SHRINKING THEIR BACK WINDOW I THINK MY SUBARU HAS A NICE SIZED BACK WINDOW 
A LOT OF DETAILS THAT JUST TAKE TIME TO GET USED TOO 
A LOT OF FEATURES DO NOT SEEM TO SYNC WITH MY IPHONE PROPERLY THE DEALER TOLD ME THIS WAS AN ISSUE WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WANT TO CONNECT FOR AUDIO 
A LOT OF GREAT SAFETY FEATURES TO PREVENT AN ACCIDENT 
A LOT OF MUSIC OPTIONS IN THIS CAR SO IF YOUR A MUSIC LOVER I RECOMMEND IT!
A LOT OF OPTIONS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING WHEN TRYING TO DRIVE
A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY LOOKING FOR A USE ITS EASIER TO USE TOUCHSCREEN OR KNOBS THAN PLAY WITH THE VOICE NONRECOGNTION SYSTEM
A LOT OF THE FEATURES COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY ALSO COULD WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY 
A LOT OF THESE FEATURES ARE NEW TO ME AND I DON T HAVE ANYTHING TO COMPARE THEM TO 
A LOT OF TIME CONNECTING A USB DEVICE IS DIFFICULT YOU HAVE TO UNPLUG AND REPLUG THE DEVICE MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THE CAR ACTUALLY RECOGNIZES THE DEVICE 
A LOT OF VEHICLES TODAY HAVE POOR REAR VISIBILITY AND LARGE BLIND SPOTS MINI IS VERY GOOD IN THIS RESPECT ONE OF THE REASONS I BOUGHT THE CAR 
A MAJOR FACTOR IN OUR DECISION TO PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE IS THAT WE CAN EASILY SEE IN ALL DIRECTIONS
A MINOR BLIND SPOT BY THE BACK ROOF FRAME 
A MOMENTARY LAG IN ACCELERATION
A MORE AFFORDABLE HIGH END BRAND NAME SOUND SYSTEM WITH NAVIGATION AND SATELLITE RADIO
A MORE ATTRACTIVE LCD DISPLAY INTERACTION WOULD HELP ENHANCE DESIRABILITY IN ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF EV S CONSIDERING AN EXTERNAL INCLUSION OF ANDROIDAUTO AND CARPLAY COULD EASILY IMPROVE THE USER EXPERIENCE GREATLY 
A MORE IN DEPTH EQUALIZER WOULD BE NICE 
A MORE INFORMATIVE DISPLAY 
A MORE MODERN TYPE OF RADIO WOULD BE BETTER 
A MORE REASONABLE PRICE TO ENSURE CURRENT MAPS 
A MORE REASONABLY PRICED BOSE SYSTEM
A MORE RELIABLE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND FULL FLEDGED ALBUM COVERS FOR MY MUSIC WHEN PLAYING THE MEDIA THROUGH THE USB DRIVE 
A MULTI CD INSTEAD OF ONLY ONE I HAD A SIX CD ON MY 2006 ACURATSX
A MULTIPLE CD PLAYER IN THE 4 CYC
A NAVAGATION SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT NEED ON STAR
A NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE INSTALLED SINCE THE MY COMPASS DIDN T COME WITH ONE 
A NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT IS EASY TO USE WITH EASY TO UNDERSTAND DIRECTIONS AND ONE THAT OWNERS DO NOT HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE UPDATED ALSO A SYSTEM THAT CAN BE TURNED OFF WITHOUT HAVING TO STOP MAYBE OFFERING A CLASS TO TEACH OWNERS HOW TO USE THES 
A NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE DON T HAVE THAT!
A NEW MODEL OF THE SRX NEEDS DESIGN IMPROVEMENT IN VISIBILITY FOR SURE WINDOWS IN A DIFFERENT ROOF LINE WOULD HELP I THINK 
A NICE ADDITION WOULD BE CAMERA ACTIVATION TO SHOW AREA BESIDE VEHICLE WHEN TURN SIGNAL IS ACTIVATED
A OK!
A PASSANGER IN THE FRONT MAKES COMPLETELY BLOCKS VISIBILITY FOR TURNING
A PASSENGER SEAT ARM REST EVERYONE LOOKS FOR ONE WHEN THEY SIT THERE
A PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THE SYSTEM WHILE IN MOTION WITHOUT STOPPING THE VEHICLE CERTAIN APPS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WHILE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION
A PAUSE BUTTON AT THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD BE NICE 
A PHYSICAL DASH BUTTON TO SWITCH DISPLAY BETWEEN ENTERTAINMENT/CLIMATE/PHONE/VEHICLE STATUS DISPLAYS THERE IS ONE BUTTON FOR VEHICLE STATUS CHARGING THAT WORKS WELL BUT NO BUTTONS TO QUICKLY GO TO RADIO OR CLIMATE WITHOUT GOING THROUGH THE HO 
A PILAR BLIND STOP
A PILLAR BLIND SPOT IF YOU ARE TALL AND LONG LEGGED
A PILLAR BLOCKS VIEW FOR SHORTER DRIVERS TOWARD RIGHT SIDE FOR DRIVER
A PILLAR GETS IN MY WAY WHEN TURNING LEFT OR WATCHING FOR PEDESTRIANS ETC
A PILLAR IS TOO WIDE 
A PILLAR IS VERY WIDE WHICH REDUCES VISIBILITY AT TIMES B PILLAR IS TOO FAR FORWARD AND MAY REDUCE VISIBILITY WHEN PULLING OUT/MAKING A LEFT ONTO A ROADWAY ONLY A PROBLEM WHEN SOMEONE IS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT 
A PILLAR SEEMS TO BE IN A BAD SPOT WHILE TURNING LEFT AND THE MIRRORS ARE A LITTLE ON THE SMALL SIDE BUT ACCEPTABLE BARELY 
A PILLAR WAY TOO WIDE
A PILLARS
A PILLARS A BIG BUT OTHERWISE EXCELLENT
A PILLARS AND B PILLARS PROVIDE A CHALLENGE WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN ON A ONE WAY LEFT STREET THE PILLARS CAN BE HARD TO SEE AROUND WHEN LOOKING RIGHT
A PILLARS ARE A LITTLE THICK 
A PILLARS ARE A LITTLE THICK REDUCING SOME PERIPHERAL VISION

ADJUSTING THE BASS TREBLE SPEAKER BALANCE ETC IS TOO DIFFICULT WHEN DRIVING WOULD RATHER HAVE A KNOB THAN A SCREEN THAT MUST BE WATCHED TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS 
ADJUSTING THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS POSES A PROBLEM AND SEEM TO CHANGE ONCE ADJUSTED 
ADJUSTING THE TREBLE/BASS NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND
ADJUSTING THE VOICE LEVEL OF THE NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS WAS NOT CLEAR IT TOOK A WEEK TO FIGURE IT OUT 
ADJUSTING THE VOLUME OF THE AUDIO IS DIFFICULT THE TOUCH SCREEN DOESN T ALWAYS RESPOND 
ADJUSTING VOLUME OF ENTERTAINMENT AUDIO FROM STEERING WHEEL
ADJUSTMENT OF MIRRORS IS VERY CRITICAL TO ASSURE NO BLIND SPOTS
ADJUSTMENT OF THE ALERT SOUNDS WHEN STARTING TRUCK SEAT BELT ALERT WOULD IMPROVE THE EXPERIENCE CURRENTLY IT CHANNELS THROUGH THE SPEAKERS AND IS ANNOYINGLY LOUD 
ADJUSTMENTS WHILE DRIVING ARE DIFFICULT AND NOT REAL INTUITIVE WITHOUT CAR S MANUAL TO GUIDE YOU 
ADVANCE NOTICE OF STREET NAME OF NEXT TURN
ADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES SHOULD BE STANDARD AT AN 80K PRICE POINT 
ADVERTISED IN ADVERTISEMENTS VIDEOS AND MANUAL THAT REAR BACK UP CAMERA HAS ADAPTIVE LINES WHILE BACKING UP NOT PRESENT
AERODYNAMIC DESIGN DOES NOT LET THE DRIVER SEE THE FENDERS THIS ASPECT MAKES IT HARDER TO JUDGE CLOSENESS TO OBSTACLES ON EITHER SIDE 
AESTHETICS
AESY TO USE WHILE DRIVING
AFTER ALMOST 3 MONTHS I AM STILL NOT USED TO THE BLIND SPOT WHEN I AM CHANGING LANES
AFTER DRIVING A LINCOLN THAT HAD A SOUND SYSTEM THAT WAS AWFUL I REALLY APPRECIATE THE MULTIPLE VOLUME LEVELS THAT I CAN USE SOMETIMES I HAVE IT AS LOW AS VOLUME 4 BUT AT TIMES TAKE IT UP TO LEVEL 25 IN THE LINCOLN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A RANG 
AFTER DRIVING A MINI VAN THAT IS HIGH OFF THE GROUND WITH GREAT VISIBILITY THE PASSAT IS A BIT OF AN ADJUSTMENT THE CAR HAS MORE BLIND SPOTS THAN MY VAN DID 
AFTER DRIVING BMWS FOR SO LONG THIS CAR FEELS LIKE A GO CART AND DOESN T GO OVER BUMPS IN THE ROAD WITHOUT GREAT NOISE AND IMPACT THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I THOUGHT I HIT SOMETHING BIG 
AFTER DRIVING MY WIFE S LEXUS WITH BLIND SPOT MONITORING WHICH IS BRIGHT LOCATED ON THE MIRROR ITSELF AND WORKS TO 0 MPH I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE BMW SYSTEM THE INDICATOR LIGHT IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH THE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK BELOW 20 30 
AFTER DRIVING THIS VEHICLE FOR 3 MONTHS NOW I DO SEE BLIND SPOTS HOWEVER OWNING 3 PRIOR TOYOTA S I NOTICE THIS IS A COMMON FACTOR
AFTER GETTING USE TO THE INTERFACE WE LOVE THE SYSTEM 
AFTER HAVING THE CAR BREAK DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF A HIGHWAY FOUR DAYS AFTER PURCHASE I AM ALWAYS WORRIED NOW THAT IT MIGHT HAPPEN AGAIN 
AFTER HAVING THREE OTHER SIENNA LIMITED AUTOS THIS ONE IS FAR SUPERIOR FROM MY 2012 I LOVE IT! IT IS MUCH EASIER TO USE AND VERY CLEAR 
AFTER MARKET GPS INSTALLED HARD TO USE RECOGNITION FOR VOICE COMMAND FOR ADDRESS LOCATION IT HAS DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING
AFTER MARKET REAR CAMERA SUCKS DEALER ADDED IT TO MY PACKAGE TO SELL THE CAR
AFTER OWNING HONDAS FOR 19 YEARS THIS IS THE SAFEST VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED 
AFTER PRACTICE FAIRLY EASY TO USE 
AFTER PRESSING THE VOICE COMMAND BUTTON THE VOICE COMMAND INSTRUCTIONS CHOICES FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS THE INSTRUCTIONS CAN BE INTERRUPTED BY PRESSING THE COMMAND BUTTON AGAIN BUT YOU STILL GET THE INSTRUCTIONS STARTING IMMEDIATELY YOU 
AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR IT TOOK SOME TIME TO GET USE TO THE LANE CHANGE PROTECTION AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM 
AFTER REVIEWING NAV SYSTEMS IN VEHICLES SUCH AS MERCEDES DODGE GM AND FORD THE NAV SYSTEM IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE
AFTER TEST DRIVING SEVERAL SUVS PRIOR TO BUYING THE SANTA FE VISIBILITY WAS FAR THE BEST IN THIS VEHICLE AT MY HEIGHT OF 5 2 
AFTER THIS SURVEY I M GOING TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER MY CAMARO OFFERS VOICE ACTIVATED MUSIC CONTROL IF NOT THIS WOULD BE A VERY DESIRABLE FEATURE 
AFTER TWO BMW SEDANS I LOVE THE SUV BEING HIGHER UP I FEEL VERY SAFE IN IT 
AFTER USING A GARMIN FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS THE BUILT IN SYSTEM IS A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT THE M B SYSTEM CANNOT DO MANY THINGS MY GARMIN COULD AND THERE IS NO WAY TO ALTER THE DISPLAY SOME OF IT IS JUST REALLY SIMPLE E G I WANT IT TO SHOW 
AFTER YEARS OF NOT HAVING A REAR VIEW CAMERA WHEN BACKING I FOUND MYSELF NOT UTILIZING AT FIRST BUT HAVE BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE RECENTLY WITH NOT HAVING TO TURN MY NECK SO OFTEN WHEN BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY I STILL TEND TO MAKE SURE WHEN D 
AFTER YOU LEARN HOW IT WORKS IT IS A BREEZE 
AGAIN A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN PROGRAMS
AGAIN AS I MENTIONED MY CAR IS SUPER BASIC I WISH MY CAR WAS MORE HIGH TECH THAT WAY I COULD ENJOY MY 45 MINUTE DRIVE TO WORK AND MY 45 MINUTE DRIVE BACK HOME A LOT MORE 
AGAIN BECAUSE I AM SHORT THE VISOR DOES NOT BLOCK OUT THE SUN WHEN IT IS JUST ABOVE THE HORIZON COULD USE AN EXTENDER

AGAIN HONDA DOES EVERYTHING RIGHT IT IS PERFECT!
AGAIN I AM CONCERN ABOUT THE BLIND SPOTS WITH THE WINDSHIELD POSTS AT 45 DEGREE ANGLES ALSO THE DANGER OF PROCEEDING AFTER STOP SIGNS WHEN THE CAR STALLS MONENTARILY UPO STARTING FORWARD THEN CATCHS AND LURCHES INTO THE INTERSECTION WHERE THERE A 
AGAIN I AM SOMEWHAT CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE AUDIO CONTROLS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THE BUTTONS AND HOW YOU HAVE TO LOOK INTENTLY TO MAKE ANY CHANGES ALSO TO CHANGE ITEMS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN ITSELF 
AGAIN I AM VERY SHORT THE SUN VISORY IS NOT LOW ENOUGH FOR EARLY MORNING AND WITHOUT THE SIDE MIRRORS I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE BEHIND ME 
AGAIN I CANNOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE VISIBILITY I KNEW WHAT I WAS BUYING 
AGAIN I CANNOT FIGURE IT OUT 
AGAIN I DON T LIKE HAVING TO LOOK AT THE PANEL AND PUSHING THE SCREEN SO MUCH IT TAKES MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TOO LONG 
AGAIN I FEEL A DESIGN ISSUE ON ANSWERING YOUR HANDS FREE PHONE YOU MUST LOOK DOWN AT THE KNOB TO PUSH IT TO ANSWER THE PHONE AND HANG IT UP THE SOLUTION SHOULD BE A VERY EASY BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO ANSWER CALLS AND HANG UP CALLS THI 
AGAIN I FEEL IT S VERY HIGH TECH AND ADVANCED IT S SOMETHING I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHERING MY UNDERSTANDING KNOWLEDGE AND USE IN 
AGAIN I HAVE GOOD FEELING ABOUT THE VEHICLE 
AGAIN I M STILL GETTING USED TO THE DRIVERS SIDE BLIND SPOT BUT THE SPLIT SIDE VIEW MIRROR HELPS I M ALSO NOT USED TO THE REAR WINDOW BEING SMALLER THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR HONDA CIVIC BUT THE VISIBILITY IS ADEQUATE 
AGAIN I M TALL 6 4 AND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS RIGHT IN MY LINE OF SIGHT AT A 4 WAY STOP THE CAR ON THE RIGHT WILL BE ALMOST COMPLETELY HIDDEN BEHIND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OPTION TO MOVE IT UP 3 
AGAIN I THINK ITS TIME TO MOVE TO TWO REAR SCREENS SO THAT A DRIVER CAN SEE OUT OF THE BACK 
AGAIN IT S A PRIUS ISN T THAT WHY PEOPLE BUY THESES THINGS 
AGAIN IT S ALL ABOUT THE TOUCH PAD AND GETTING AROUND BETWEEN ALL THE MENU CHOICES WAY TOO COMPLICATED LOVE THE CAR HATE THE TOUCH PAD!
AGAIN IT S JUST A BASIC KIA FORTE THAT S OVER PRICED
AGAIN LOVE THE BLUETOOTH LOVE THE FEATURES OF THE AUDIO BUT THE RADIO AND SPEAKERS ARE HORRIBLE! PROOF IS IN DODGE OFFERING A $ 400 00 AMP TO MAKE IT RIGHT WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FROM THE GET GO NOT FOR AN ADDITIONAL $ 400 00 TO THE CONSUM 
AGAIN MOST OF THE FEATURES ARE COMMONLY AVAILABLE AND THERE IS NOTHING APPEALING TO SAY SO VIDEO FEATURE FOR 2ND AND 3RD ROW IS GOOD BUT RARELY USED AFTER USING SOME OF THE BEST AUDIO SYSTEMS EARLIER I FEEL I AM MISSING A LOT ON MEDIA SIDE 
AGAIN MY 91 YEAR OLD MOTHER IN LAW IS SHORT WHEN DRIVING INTO THE SUN I HAVE TO PLACE A LONG PIECE OF PAPER CLIPPED ON THE SUN VISOR TO SHADE HER FROM THE SUN I MISS HAVING THE EXTENSIONS ON THE VISOR

AGAIN THE BLIND SPOTS THRU THE WINDSHIED WHEN MAKING TURNS
AGAIN THE BRAKES FEEL VERY UNSAFE AT TIMES WHEN STOPPING QUICKLY IS NECESSARY EVEN SLOWING DOWN FOR RED LIGHTS WITH THE PEDAL REACHING SO CLOSE TO THE FLOOR TO MAKE A COMPLETE STOP IS VERY UNCEASING PLUS THE FACT THAT DEALERSHIP TECHNICIANS COU 
AGAIN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM PARTICULARLY SWITCHING WITHIN THE SATELLITE RADIO 
AGAIN THE DIAL IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE 
AGAIN THE DISPLAY IS NOT THE EASIEST TO NAVIGATE SEVERAL BUTTONS TO GET TO THE WEATHER MAP FOR EXAMPLE 
AGAIN THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR IS DIFFICULT TO USE BECAUSE OF THE SPLIT MIRROR 
AGAIN THE ISSUE IS THE LIGHTS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BRIGHTER BRIGHTS FOR NIGHT DRIVING ON ROADS WITH NO ONCOMING TRAFFIC WE LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE DEER ARE PLENTIFUL AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO AVOID THIS POTENTI 
AGAIN THE ISSUE WITH THE ODD SHAPED SIDE REAR WINDOWS CAUSE ME PAUSE WHEN SWITCHING LANES MAZDA HAS A GREAT FEATURE WITH LED S THAT LIGHT UP WHEN SOMEONE IS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT AND IF YOU TURN ON YOUR TURN SIGNAL WHEN SOMEONE IS IS THE ASSOCIATED 
AGAIN THE LOCATION AND NUMBER OF USB PORTS I DO WANT TO SAY THAT PART OF THE REASON I WENT WITH SUBARU THOUGH WAS BECAUSE OF THE UNCLUTTERED NONDISTRACTING / MINIMAL BUTTONS ON THE DASH/CONSOLE 
AGAIN THE OUT OF BALANCE AND COMPARABILITY OF REAR VIEW CENTER MIRROR RELATIVE TO THE SIDE MIRRORS AND REAR VIEW CAMERA IS BAD 
AGAIN THE REAR HEADRESTS ALMOST ENTIRELY OBSTRUCT THE BLIND SIDES FROM THE REAR OF THE CAR IF NOT FOR THE WARNING LIGHTS ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS I WOULD NEVER HAVE CHOSEN THIS CAR APPARENTLY THIS IS A DESIGN OF CHOICE FOR AUDI BUT IT IS IT 
AGAIN THE REFLECTION OF THE INSIDE IN THE SIDE MIRRORS
AGAIN THE SCREEN IS TOO SMALL FOR A NEW HIGH TRIM LEVEL VEHICLE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS UPDATED AS WELL THE DISPLAYING AND READING OF TEXT MESSAGES COULD USE SOME STREAMLINING 
AGAIN THE SUN VISORS ON THIS VEHICLE ARE A JOKE
AGAIN THE SUNVISOR WHEN SWUNG AROUND DOES NOT EXTEND FAR ENOUGH FOR TALL DRIVERS
AGAIN THE VOICE REGOGNITION FEATURE IN THIS VEHICLE LEAVE A LOT TO BE DESIRED THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION PRODUCES AN ANNOYING ECHO ON THE OTHER PERSON S PHONE 
AGAIN THE VOLUME AND THE SKIP/NEXT BUTTON NEED TO BE SEPARATED 
AGAIN THERE ARE LARGER THAN USUAL BLIND SPOTS DUE TO SIZE OF BODY PIECES AT WINDOW AREAS BEHIND THE DRIVER 
AGAIN THERE IS TO MUCH THAT I LIKE TO MENTION ANY ONE ITEM THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL!
AGAIN THERE S A LEARNING CURVE I VE NEVER BEFORE OWNED A CAR WHERE I WAS THAT HIGH WHILE DRIVING ONCE THERE WAS A CAR TO MY RIGHT THAT I ALMOST DIDN T SEE I M SLOWLY LEARNING TO USE THE SMALL WIDE VIEW MIRRORS CUT INTO THE REGULAR MIRRORS 
AGAIN THIS IS VERY INTUITIVE TO USE THE PHONE CONNECTION INITIALLY TOOK SOME GETTING USED TO BUT ONCE CONNECTED IT NOW WORKS GREAT 
AGAIN VISOR ARE TOO SMALL HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE DRIVER SIDE BACK PASSENGER WINDOW WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES 
AGAIN VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVING
AGAIN WHEN BACKING UP I DO NOT NEED TO SEE THE GROUND BESIDE EACH REAR TIRE MAKES NO SENSE AND I HAVE TO CROUCH DOWN TO SEE WHAT IS BEHIND ME YES I HAVE A BACKUP CAMERA BUT THOSE GOOFY MIRRORS JUST THROW ME OFF AND I HATE IT 
AGAIN WHEN SOMEONE IN FRONT PASSENGER SEAT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES OR PEOPLE COMING FROM THE RIGHT
AGAIN WIPERS / FRONT WINDOW DESIGN IS REALLY THE ONLY MAJOR FRUSTRATION I HAVE WITH THIS VEHICLE
AGAIN WISH IT HAD NAVIGATION AND TOUCH SCREEN
AGAIN WISH THE CAR HAD SIDE/FRONT/REAR ELECTRONIC SENSOR MONITORING SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD CERTAINLY ADD COST TO THIS VEHICLE THE THREE VIEWING POSITION REAR CAMERA IS GOOD FOR BACKING UP IN PARKING WE DID NOT FEEL THAT THE AUDI Q5 WITH A 
AGILITY
AH HA APPS ARE NOT VERY USEFUL OR INTUITIVE WOULD BE BETTER WITH APPLE PLAY OR SIMILAR SYSTEM 
AIR BAGS DO NOT WORK PROPERLY
AIR BAGS/SAFETY
AIR CONDITIONING
AIR RIDE SUSPENSION
AIRBAG ANGLE IS BAD
AIRBAG RECALL R05! I AM HAPPY THIS WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION SOONER THAN LATER 
AIRBAGS AND UVO EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE SERVICE SAVED ME FROM INJURY IN ACCIDENT
AIRBAGS WAS THE MOST APPEALING WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE TO LEARN THAT THERE WAS A DEFECT IN DRIVER AIRBAG ASSEMBLY AT DELIVERY IS THE WORST THING EXTREMELY DIS SATISFIED THAT HONDA DOESNT RECOGNIZE THAT AND IS NOT WILLING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY 
AIRPLAY CONNECTIVITY FOR OPTION VOICE RECOGNITION ADVANCES

ALL ASPECTS VERY WELL THOUGHT THROUGH
ALL BUTTONS ON DASH ARE ARE GREAT BUT THE KNOB CONTROL IS NOT GOOD THERE SHOULD BE A TOUCH SCREEN BUT PLEASE DO NOT GO ALL TOUCH SCREEN I HAVE AN ACURA THAT IS ALL TOUCH SCREEN AND I DO NOT LIKE IT 
ALL CARS HAVE BLIND SPOTS THE CAMRY IS PRETTY GOOD ABOUT ITS BLIND SPOTS THE CAR FEELS VERY STURDY SAFE AND WELL BUILT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE PLACEMENT AND DESIGN OF THE SIDE MIRRORS I DONT LIKE THEM I KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE STYLISH AND AL 
ALL CARS HAVE THAT BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDE FORM AN APPROACHING VEHICLE
ALL CARS OF THIS CLASS SHOULD COME WITH A NAV SYSTEM
ALL CARS SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH LANE CHANGE ASSIST TO WARN REGARDING VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT THIS IS TRUE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE DRIVER S EXPERIENCE
ALL COMPONENTS SHOULD BE VOICE ACTIVATED TO AVOID BREAKING EYESIGHT WITH ROAD WHEN DRIVING 
ALL CONTAINED IN CENTER TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY UNIT

ALL MODELS SHOULD HAVE A COLLISION AWARENESS SENSOR 
ALL MODELS SHOULD HAVE LANE CHANGE MONITORING AS A STANDARD FEATURE
ALL MY FRIENDS WITH BMW S AND AUDI S TELL ME OUR NAV AND MAP SYSTEMS ARE FAR SUPERIOR 
ALL NA S ARE BECAUSE THE CAR HAS 3 MILES ON IT AND HAS BEEN STORED SINCE DAY OF DELIVERY IF YOU LIKE TO CONTACT ME AT THE END OF THE SUMMER I CAN T HONESTLY EVALUATE THE CAR OTHER THAN THE CONTROLS UNTIL I START DRIVING IT 
ALL NEW CARS SUCK NOT JUST THIS NISSAN DESIGN OF 20 YEARS AGO HAD MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY 
ALL NEW VEHICLES SHOULD COME WITH BLUETOOTH AND EASE OF USE BUT I HAD TO GET AFTERMARKET BLUETOOTH EVEN AFTER BUYING A CAR FOR 28K WTF?
ALL NISSANS SHOULD HAVE THE SMART REARVIEW MIRROR INSTALLED

ALL OF IT I HAVE THE UPGRADED STEREO BUT IT TOO IS WAY UNDER POWERED THE SPEAKERS ARE FIT FOR A RUSSIAN TRABANT PURE GARBAGE THE BOSE SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE UPGRADE IN THIS CAR FOR $700

ALL SYSTEMS ARE INTEGRATED 
ALL SYSTEMS ARE VERY GOOD ON THE AUDIO I M A BIG AUDIOPHILE AND THOUGHT THE SYSTEM WAS GOOD NOT GREAT I ACTUALLY WAS PLAYING SOME JAZZ AT A PRETTY HIGH VOLUME AND THE DRIVER SIDE SPEAKER WAS VIBRATING NOT A GOOD SIGN I WENT INTO THE AUDIO 
ALL SYSTEMS SEEM TO BE INTERGRATED VERY WELL
ALL SYSTEMS WORK FINE I NORMALLY LISTEN TO XM RADIO MOVING BETWEEN MY PRE SET STATIONS DEPENDING ON MY MOOD AT THAT TIME 
ALL TACOMA S HAVE A NASTY BLIND SPOT WHEN DRIVING THIS IS MY SECOND AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE 
ALL TAURUS SHOULD COME WITH A PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM 
ALL THAT STUFF IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND TRIES TO DUPLICATE EVERYTHING THAT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE AND EASY TO USE ON MY I PHONE SATELLITE RADIO AND ON STAR SEEMS LIKE A BIG WASTE OF MONEY 
ALL THE 2015S I TEST DROVE HAVE THE BACKUP CAMERA WHICH I DID NOT HONESTLY WANT BUT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN OUTSTANDING FEATURE WHICH I USE EVERY TIME I BACK UP I DROVE A RUBICON AND WAS EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED WITH THE POOR VISIBILITY OUT ALL SIDES

ALL THE SUPPORT PILLARS A B C ARE VERY LARGE I LIKE THE SAFETY THAT PROVIDES TO THE VEHICLE BUT IT DOES OCCASIONALLY MAKE VISIBILITY MORE PROBLEMATIC THAN OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE DRIVEN 
ALL THESE QUESTIONS DO NOT APPLY TO ME I DO NOT LISTEN TO MUSIC IN THE CAR AND MY CELL PHONE IS NOT LINKED TO THE VEHICLE I ONLY RATED A 6 SINCE THERE IS NOT A N/A CHOICE 
ALL THESE QUESTIONS FOR ONLY $1???
ALL THESE SYSTEMS IN ALL VEHICLES ARE GETTING TOO ELABORATE AND COMPLEX CX 9 SYSTEM IS MUCH EASIER THAN ONE IN SIMILAR VEHICLE 3 YEARS OLDER DESIGNERS ARE IMPROVING USABILITY BUT TO BE REALLY SAFE YOU HAVE TO USE THE FEATURES OF THESE SYSTEMS 
ALL THESE SYSTEMS SEEM TO HAVE UNIQUE FEATURES SO I AM MEDIOCRE ABOUT THEIR USE I LIKE THE PASSENGER TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE ADDRESS IN THE NAV SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING ONSTAR TAKES CARE OF THAT FOR ME BUT I WOULD ALLOW AN OVERRIDE IF I COULD 
ALL THINGS IN MY FORD ARE GREAT

ALTHOUGH I HAVE ANOTHER LEXUS FROM 2010 WHICH WAS EASY TO PROGRAM THE REMOTE GARAGE CONTROL ON I STILL CANNOT PROGRAM IT ON THE GS 350
ALTHOUGH I HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY USING THE MIRRORS IN THE DRIVERS SEAT MY PREVIOUS SRX 2012 AFFORDED ME BETTER USE OF THE 3 MIRRORS WHILE I WAS DRIVING I DO LIKE THE FACT THAT I AM ABLE TO KNOW WHEN IT IS SAFE TO CHANGE LANES BECAUSE THE SID 
ALTHOUGH I HEAR PEOPLE WELL OVER THE BLUE TOOTH IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO HEAR ME ALSO THE SPEAKERS AND SOUND SYSTEM ARE NOT VERY GOOD IN MY OPINION FOR PLAYING MUSIC 
ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE SLEEK BODY STYLE OF THIS VEHICLE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND OF CHANGE SOMEHOW WITHOUT MESSING UP THE STYLE IN THE REAR WINDSHIELD AS FAR AS VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER SEAT IF THERE S NO WAY OF DEALING WITH THAT THEN JUST 
ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE LIKED THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM TO HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ON THE SV TRIM I DO APPRECIATE THE LONG RANGE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS 
ALTHOUGH IT HAS A BOSE SYSTEM I FEEL LIKE IT COULD HAVE BETTER AUDIO ADJUSTMENT OPTIONS/SOUND BETTER 
ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS NICE FROM THE EXTERIOR THE PORTION OF THE VEHICLE BETWEEN THE REAR WINDOW AND THE BACK SIDE WINDOWS IS LARGE THIS MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN REVERSING ALSO VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE AFTER MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN 
ALTHOUGH IT S A SAFETY FEATURE I FEEL AS THOUGH THE LANE CHANGING DETECTION STAYS ON A LITTLE LONGER EVEN IF THE CAR IS FAR ENOUGH BEHIND TO PASS SAFELY WOULDN T EXPECT CHANGES FROM MANUFACTURER THOUGH BETTER TO BE SAFE THERE IS GOOD VISIBI 
ALTHOUGH ONE CAN CHANGE STATIONS THAT ARE PROGRAMED WITH SIMPLE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS WHICH REQUIRE AN EXTRA SET HOME RADIO RATHER THAN SIMPLE CONTROLS PROGRAMING OR SCANNING STATION IS TOO COMPLICATED AND PROBABLY A SAFETY HAZARD IF DONE WHI 
ALTHOUGH OVERALL VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING THE RIGHT/REAR TRICKS YOU B/C THERE IS A GREY RIM INSIDE THE CAR THAT APPEARS TO BLOCK THE VIEW TOWARDS THE RIGHT/REAR 4 TO 5 O CLOCK AREA 
ALTHOUGH REAR AND SIDE VISABILITY IS BELOW AVERAGE IT CAN BE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED BY LOWERING 3RD ROW HEADRESTS AND STRATIGIC USE OF REARVIEW MIRRORS 
ALTHOUGH REAR WINDOW IS SMALL THE TWO SIDE VIEW MIRRORS MORE THEN MAKE UP AMPLE VIEWING 
ALTHOUGH SMALL I FEEL SAFER IN THE CAR NORE THAN I WOULD IN A MINI COOPER OR OTHER SMALL CAR
ALTHOUGH THE INTERIOR NOISE LEVELS OF THE 2015 JUKE ARE BETTER THAN PRIOR MODEL YEARS THE BACKGROUND DRIVING NOISE INTERFERES WITH THE AUDIO QUALITY OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM 
ALTHOUGH THE IPHONE 6 HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR SOME TIME MINI HAS NOT BOTHERED TO MAKE A COMPATIBLE ADAPTER FOR THE ARMREST HOLDER THAT I PAID EXTRA FOR WHEN PURCHASING THE CAR THIS MEANS I CANNOT LISTEN TO MUSIC OR AUDIOBOOKS BEYOND THE PHONE BA 
ALTHOUGH THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS ARE THE SAME SIZE ANS MY LAST WRANGLER THERE SEEM TO BE MORE BLIND SPOTS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS TO BE SMALLER AS WELL AND HAS MORE BLIND SPOTS THAN THE 2008 MODEL
ALTHOUGH THE REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS NOT THE BEST THE REAR CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEMS ARE VERY GOOD STEPS TOWARDS ELIMINATING THOSE ISSUES AS PROBLEMS 
ALTHOUGH THE SUN VISORS ARE EFFECTIVE THEY ARE TOO BIG AND BULKY 
ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE IS SMALL AND TENDS TO BE PUSHED AROUND BY WIND ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY OVERALL THE STREET FEATURES DO MAKE ME FEEL SAFE DRIVING MY KIA 
ALTHOUGH THE VISORS SLIDE SIDEWAYS BUT IT ISN T LONG ENOUGH FOR SHORT PEOPLE DURING MORNING & EVENING DRIVES EAST OR WEST
ALTHOUGH THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDES OF THE VEHICLE THE ELECTRONIC AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF VISIBILITY 
ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT A LOT OF WINDOW SPACE IN THE VEHICLE BECAUSE IT IS SO SMALL YOU ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO SEE A LOT THE ONLY BIG CONCERN IS THE BLINDSPOTS ON THE SIDES BUT THE BLINDSPOT MONITOR PICKS UP THE VEHICLE BY YOU EVERYTIME 
ALTHOUGH VOICE RECOGNITION IS INCONSISTENT IT S A VERY NICE FEATURE
ALTHOUGH WE HAVEN T USED IT YET WE RE EXCITED TO USE AN EXTERNAL SOURCE FOR PLAYING OUR MUSIC 
ALTHOUGH WINDOW HEIGHT IS LOW THE CAR IS GREAT AT MINIMZING SUN GLARE AND OVERHEATING IN THE CABIN WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE IN THE DESERT 
ALTIMA SHOULD BE MADE IN AN ALL WHEEL DRIVE I DO NOT LIKE DRIVING TRUCKS OR SUV S 
ALWAYS BETTER TO PUT THE THIRD ROW SEATS INTO FOLD FLAT MODE SO YOU CAN SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOW 
ALWAYS FEEL A PILLARS ARE TOO LARGE IN ANY CAR 
ALWAYS FEEL SAFE GETTING INTO THE TACOMA BEING UP AS HIGH AS IT IS MAKES FOR GREAT VISIBILITY DURING ALL CONDITIONS 
ALWAYS FEEL SAFE IN AN ACURA THAT S WHY I DON T EVEN CHECK OUT OTHER VEHICLES WHEN IT COMES TIME TO PURCHASE ANOTHER CAR I ALWAYS HAVE GOOD LUCK WITH MY ACURAS VERY SAFE 
ALWAYS FEEL SAFE IN ANY OF MY MERCEDES BENZ S VEHICLES
ALWAYS FEEL SAFE IN MY SUBURBAN
ALWAYS FEELS PLANTED ON THE ROAD LOVE THE FEEL 
ALWAYS HAVE ISSUES WITH CARS BESIDE ME THE MIRROR IS NOT BIG ENOUGH OR SOMETHING I CHECK AND CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK BEFORE I GET IN THE LEFT LANE OF TRAFFIC 
ALWAYS INCLUDE AUDIO CONTROL BUTTONS ON STEERING WHEEL IT REALLY ENHANCES SAFETY AND AVOIDS DRIVER DISTRACTION SHOULD BE A BASE PRICE ITEN 
ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS 
ALWAYS THE BLIND SPOT FROM SIDE MIRRORS PERHAPS EVERY VEHICLE SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THE SENSORS BUILT IN 
ALWAYS USE THE TRAFFIC INFO FROM THE SATELLITE SYSTEM ON THE NAVIGATION MAP WHEN ON THE FREEWAYS FAVORITE FEATURE 
AM AND FM STATION SELECTIONS MYSTERIOUS AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MAKE NO CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN EITHER 
AM CONTROL ON ENTERTAINMENT HARDER TO USE THAN ON FM 
AM FAIRLY TALL SO SOME ISSUES WITH THAT WHEN VIEWING TRAFFIC TOWARDS THE 11 O CLOCK WHERE THE RIGHT FRONT WINDSHIELD PILLAR SOMETIMES OBSTRUCTS ROAD VIEW ESPECIALLY ON ROUNDABOUTS 
AM FM RADIO SOUND IS WONDERFULL I HAVE A HAND GARMIN NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND HAVING THIS SYSTEM IN THE CAR IS GREAT 
AM IN LOVE WITH THE LED LIGHTING MAKES AN AMAZING DIFFERENCE WHEN DRIVING ESPECIALLY ON CURVY ROADS 
AM NOT ELECTRONICALLY LITERATE SO SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS WOULD BE GOOD 
AM RADIO IS NOT VERY GOOD ALL OTHERS ARE EXCELENT
AM RADIO RECEPTION 
AM RADIO RECEPTION NEEDS VAST IMPROVEMENT 
AM RADIO SEEMS TO FADE IN AND OUT
AM RADIO SHOULD HAVE BETTER RECEPTION
AM RECEPTION IS NOT ALWAYS GOOD IT JUST MAY BE THE OBSTACLES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD FM CD AND SATELLITE RECEPTION/SOUND IS EXCELLENT 
AM STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY HAD NAV SYSTEM FAIRLY STEEP LEARNING CURVE FOR NON TECH OLD LADY BUT THINK I WILL LIKE IT WHEN I AM MORE SKILLED AT USING
AM TOLD PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING ME ON THE PHONE DON T KNOW IF THAT IS A PROBLEM WITH MY PHONE OR THE BLUETOOTH 
AM VERY PLEASED CANNOT THINK OF ANY IMPROVEMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED 
AMAZING
AMAZING AUDIO SYSTEM LOVE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO MY PHONE AND I REALLY ENJOY THE FACT THAT I HAVE AUSB PLUG FOR MY IPOD OR IPHONE AND XM RADIO IS GREAT NO COMMERCIALS 
AMAZING DISPLAY AND TOUCHSCREEN
AMAZING HANDLING IN ALL WEATHER CONDITIONS

AMAZING SOUND WITH THE UPGRADED SYSTEM LOVE PLAYING MUSIC FROM MY IPHONE TOO 
AMAZING SOUND!
AMAZING TOP DOWN 360 DEGREE PARKING CAMERA VIEW
AMAZING VISIBILITY JUST ABOUT FULL 360 DEGREE VIEW
AMAZING!!
AN ADDITIONAL DRIVER SIDE VISOR FOR THE SIDE WINDOW WOULD BE GREAT THE SLIDING EXTENDING VISOR HELPS BUT NOT A LOT 
AN ADDITIONAL USB PORT AND I HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH THE VOICE COMMANDS FOR NAVIGATION
AN ADJUSTMENT OPTION FOR THE SUN VISOR FOR SHORT DRIVERS 
AN ANNOYING THING IS THAT I CANNOT CHANGE THE RADIO STATION OR USE THE AUDIO SYSTEM AT ALL WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN REVERSE IT IS AS IF THE BACK UP CAMERA TAKES OVER THE SYSTEM ALSO A FEATURE THAT I REALLY DO NOT LIKE IS THAT YOU CANNOT SEE INF 
AN ANTENNA THAT WORKS WOULD BE GOOD AND NOT HAVING TO WAIT 3 PLUS WEEKS NOW FOR REPAIR VERY FRUSTRATING 
AN APP THAT KEEPS US AWAKE WOULD BE GREAT!
AN AUDIO SYSTEM THAT AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTED FOR ROAD NOISE WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT 
AN EASIER AND MORE ACCURATE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE WONDERFUL
AN EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO KEEP EVERYTHING IN THE CAR AT YOUR FINGERTIPS SO PRIORITY CAN BE ON THE ROAD AND DRIVING THE CAR 
AN EXCEPTIONAL VEHICLE!
AN EXTENSION TO THE SIDE VISOR WOULD HELP THOSE OF US WHO HAVE THE SEAT ALL THE WAY BACK 
AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF FRONT SUN VISORS IS THEIR ABILITY TO SLIDE ALONG THE MOUNTING BAR SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE TURNED TO COVER PART OF THE SIDE WINDOW THEY CAN IN FACT COVER IT LEXUS HAS HAD THIS ABILITY FOR OVER A DECADE WHILE PORSCHE STILL DO 
AN INSTRUCTIONAL COURSE FOR SENIORS WOULD BE APPRECIATED 
AN INTEGRATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITH A TOUCHSCREEN RADIO SYSTEM 
AN ISSUE I HAVE IS HAVING THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY STOPPED TO USE THE NAVIGATION IS FRUSTRATING AT TIMES I UNDERSTAND IT S FOR SAFETY PURPOSES BUT I FEEL MY PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENTER/USE SUCH FUNCTIONS FOR ME WHILE I AM DRIVING I HAVE COMM

ANOTHER BMW THING THE VOLUME KNOB IS TOO SMALL!
ANOTHER ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE HAD IN PURCHASING A NEW VEHICLE WAS TO HAVE GOOD ALL AROUND VISIBILITY FOR THE DRIVER THE HONDA PILOT HAS EXCELLENT VISIBILITY 
ANOTHER REASON I PURCHASED THIS CAR VISABILITY WAS BETTER THAN MY TUCSON
ANOTHER STUPID QUESTION 
ANOTHER USB PORT CD PLAYER 
ANSWER THE PHONE 
ANSWERING MY PHONE
ANSWERING PHONE CALLS WITHOUT TOUCHING CELL PHONE IS GREAT 
ANSWERINNG THE PHONE
ANTENNA IS NOT GOOD QUALITY
ANTI COLLISION FEATURES ARE FANTASTIC 
ANTI COLLISION PACKAGES SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE BLIND SPOT ALERT WE HAVE FRONT AND BACK COLLISION ALERT LANE CHANGE ALERT BUT NOT BLIND SPOT IT MAKES NO SENSE?
ANTI COLLISION SAVED ME FROM AN ACCIDENT REAR COLLISION DETECTION ALSO PREVENTED AN ACCIDENT 
ANTI COLLISION SYSTEM IS QUITE SENSITIVE THE CAR BEEPS WHEN UNNECESSARY FRONT WIPERS ARE LACKING IN A TOTAL WINDOW WIPE A BIG SPOT IN THE DRIVERS FIELD OF VISION ISN T ENTIRELY CLEARED FURTHERMORE WHEN WASHING THE CAR WHEN I LIFT THE WIP 
ANTI LOCK BRAKES

ANTIQUATED WAY TO UPDATE MAPS SIM CARD DOWNLOSD $$$ 
ANY CONCERNS I HAVE ARISE FROM OPERATOR ERROR RATHER THAN SYSTEM ISSUES I JUST DON T USE ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES OFTEN ENOUGH TO BE PROFICIENT 
ANY LACK OF VISION MAKES A LOWER SAFETY SCORE FOR VISION RELATED MANNERS
ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DEALERSHIP?

APPLICATIONS LIKE PANDORA LOAD EXTREMELY SLOW 4 TO 6 TIMES AS SLOW AS MY PHONE NAVIGATION IS INACCURATE AND CUMBERSOME TO USE COMPARED TO GARMIN NAVIGATION

APPS ARE A JOKE BOSS SYSTEM IS BETTER THAN G37 BUT STILL SUBPAR COMPARE TO LEXUS BMW AUDIO OR ACURA 
APPS ARE DIFFICULT TO SET UP VERY DIFFICULT

APPS ARE PRETTY USELESS 
APPS ARE TERRIBLE DEALER PROMISED SUPPORT NON EXISTENT SUPPORT AND MINIMAL AT BEST APPS IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN CONNECT INTOUCH APP SYSTEM TO THE PHONE HAVE TRIED FOR MONTHS AND NOTHING I M A TECHY TOO INTOUCH ENT SYSTEM FREQUENTLY LAGS RESTARTS 
APPS AREN T ANYTHING OF VALUE 
APPS DO NOT OPEN EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN DOWNLOADED AND PHONE IS CONNECTED TO THE VEHICLE SYSTEM 
APPS DON T WORK DIFFICULT TO ACTIVATE TRIED AND TRIED WON T RECOGNIZE MY OWNERSHIP SO I DON T USE THEM
APPS DON T WORK WITH GALAXY S5
APPS POOR AND DIFFICULT TO ACCESS
APPS SUCH AS PANDORA BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM SO THEY ARE EASY TO CONTROL ALTHOUGH APPS SUCH AS PANDORA CAN BE ACCESSED VIA SMARTPHONE THEY CAN T BE CONTROLLED AS EASILY THROUGH THE VEHICLE CONTROLS THIS WAY 
APPS THAT WORK WITH IPHONE
AREA COVERED BY THE FRONT REVIEW MIRROR TAKES AWAY VISIBILITY 
AREA WHERE RADIO AND CONTROLS ARE
AREAS THAT VEHICLES BEHIND GET INTO THAT ARE BLIND TO OPERATOR IN LEAD VEHICLE

AS A SPORT COUP THE REAR WINDOW IS ONLY SO BIG THANKFULLY THE INCORPORATED REAR CAMERA MAKES PARKING EASIER 
AS A TALL DRIVER I CAN T SEE PAST THE LEFT SHOULDER PILLAR TO CHANGE LANES ON MY LEFT SIDE THE FRONT WINDSHIELD PILLARS ON BOTH SIDES ALSO CAUSES SOME SERIOUS BLIND SPOTS WHEN TAKING SHARP TURNS TO BOTH SIDES OF THE CAR 
AS A WHOLE I THINK THE SYSTEMS ARE ALL VERY USER FRIENDLY AND WELL DONE
AS A WOMAN WITH RIPENING CATARACTS I FIND THE RED/ORANGE OF THE DISPLAYS MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE GREEN/YELLOW OF MY 09 MAZDA5 THE HEADRESTS ARE MUCH LARGER ON THE 2015 THAN ON THE 2009 MODEL THIS IMPEDES MY VISION A BIT I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO

AS BEFORE TOUGH SCREEN HAD WEIRD CLICK FEEL THAT ISN T CONSISTENT NAV IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND VOICE RECOGNITION IS REALLY SLOW
AS BEFORE YOUR SURVEY IS MUCH TOO LONG
AS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS AUDI A6 AND AUDI A3 THE SYSTEMS HAVE ADVANCED RAPIDLY AND FIT MY NEEDS 
AS DESCRIBED EARLIER THE BLUE TOOTH DEVICE DOES NOT ALWAYS PROVIDE A CLEAR CONNECTION 
AS DRIVER HAVE TROUBLE LOOKING OVER LEFT SHOULDER AND HAVING GOOD VISABILITY
AS EXPECTED THE REAR VISIBILITY IS SUB PAR THIS IS WHY I ORDERED A BACK UP CAMERA IT WOULD BE GREAT IF PORSCHE WERE TO INCLUDE THE BACK UP CAMERA AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT SINCE THE REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR 
AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO SEE OUT OF THE CAR WHILE DRIVING I CAN SEE ALMOST EVERYTHING I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE AND SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR 
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH CONNECTIVITY AND IT IS DISTRACTING TO USE 
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL ENTUNE IS PRETTY WORTHLESS MUCH EASIER TO JUST USE MY PHONE FOR WHAT IT OFFERS ESPECIALLY PANDORA VIA BLUETOOTH 
AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED AS THE DRIVER LESS SIMPLICITY OF CHOICE AND OPERATION IS MORE WHERE COMMUNICATION IS CONCERNED I LOVE THE WAY IT AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGES MY WIFE S IPHONE WITH ALL IT S FEATURES AS FAR AS SATELLITE OFFERINGS THEY SHOULD

AS I AM AN ANDROID USER I WOULD REALLY LIKE ANDROID INTEGRATION AT THIS MOMENT THE HONDALINK APP ONLY WORKS WITH THE IPHONE
AS I DISCOVERED AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR I DID NOT LIKE THE REAR BACK WINDOW AT ALL IT WAS MUCH TOO SMALL I WAS USED TO MY HYUNDAI ELANTRA WHICH HAD A BIG BACK WINDOW I COULD SEE THE A LOT OF THE ROAD BEHIND ME AND EVEN A LITTLE SKY I FE 
AS I HAVE INDICATED PREVIOUSLY IN THIS SURVEY I DO NOT LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS AND I DO NOT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN 
AS I HAVE STATED BEFORE THE MAP WHICH I ASSUMED WAS THE CURRENT ONE SHOULD BE UPDATED PRIOR TO THE SALE AND IF NOT THE PURCHASER SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT YOU CANNOT PRESUME THAT THE MAP IS THE MOST CURRENT!!!!!!!
AS I MAY HAVE MENTIONED IN FIRST SURVEY THE HEATED DEFROSTING STRIP ON DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR PLAYS A BIT OF A VISUAL ILLUSION IN WHICH IT APPEARS THAT VEHICLES WHO ARE PASSING YOU FROM 2 LANES OVER ARE TRYING TO MERGE ONTO THE LANE NEXT TO YOU 
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I NEED TO EXPLORE ALL THE FEATURES I AM NOT USING MY VEHICLE TO THE FULLEST POTENTIAL FOR EXAMPLE I REALLY HAVE NEVER USED THE HANDS FREE OPTIONS

AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE FRONT WINDSHIELD HAS A NOTICEABLE PIXEL DISTORTION

AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I HAVE TO OFTEN YELL IN ORDER TO BE HEARD IN ADDITION I THINK INFINITI SHOULD PUT WAZE INTO THEIR VEHICLES TO HAVE A MORE ACCURATE SYSTEM 
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE END OF THE FRONT GLASS SIDING ON THE LEFT SIDE FEELS LIKE IT COMES IN THE WAY WHEN YOU RE MAKING A LEFT TURN
AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THE POSITION OF THE HEADRESTS IN THE BACK CAUSE SOME BLIND SPOTS IN THE BACK

AS I SAID GIVE ME BACK MY KNOBS AND BUTTONS I M OLD SCHOOL LUDDITE
AS I SAID I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR MAKING PHONE CALLS

AS I STATED ABOVE AT A TOTAL COST OF $44 000 WE EXPECTED THE CAR TO HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM THREE OF US HEARD THE SALESMAN TELL US IT HAD ONE THE LACK OF A NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON AN EXPENSIVE CAR LIKE THIS VOLVO IS INEXCUSABLE 
AS I STATED BEFORE DRIVE SIDE WIPER PROBLEM NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED
AS I STATED BEFORE THE GLARE OF THE DASHBOARD ON THE WINDSHIELD IS TERRIBLE 
AS I STATED EARLIER HIGHER PROFILE WOULD BE NICE 
AS I STATED ELSEWHERE THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT IS TERRIBLE THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS RESTRICT THE VISIBILITY 
AS I VE SAID BEFORE I AM QUITE SATISFIED WITH MY LAND ROVER OR I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED IT

AS MENTIONED BEFORE SIDE MIRRORS CAN OBSTRUCT FORWARD VISION 
AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE FRONT HOOD IS A LITTLE BIT TOO LONG & BUMPED OUT FOR THE BEST VISIBILITY 
AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE NAV SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO PROGRAM IF THE LOCATION YOU WANT IS NOT IN THE SYSTEM S PROGRAM THIS HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE LOCAL TECHNICIAN BUT CANNOT BE FIXED UNTIL A NEW MAP CARD COMES OUT WHENEVER AND THEN THEY 
AS MENTIONED EARLIER BOTH OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SHOW THE OUTLINE OF SILVER AIR VENT DECORATION FROM INSIDE VEHICLE CAUSING LACK OF VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES DEALER SUGGESTED I PUT BLACK TAPE OVER THE SILVER VENT OUTLINES AFTER SPENDIN 
AS MENTIONED EARLIER I FEEL THE BACKUP CAMERA AND SUBSEQUENT SCREEN ON THE DASHBOARD ARE NOT ONLY A WASTE OF SPACE BUT GIVES THE DRIVE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY IF YOU USE IT TO BACK THE CAR OUT OF A SPACE YOU CANNOT SEE IF THERE IS A PERSON 
AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE VEHICLE HESITATES SOMETIMES WHEN BEING PUT IN REVERSE ALSO WHEN ACCELERATING WUICKLY THE EXHAUST MAKES A NOISE THAT I AM NOT SURE IS A PORSCHE THING OR A PROBLEM 
AS MENTIONED EARLIER VOICE RECOGNITION IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING 
AS MENTIONED FOR THE MONEY WE SPENT I THINK THAT THE TECH AROUND THE IPOD CONNECTIVITY IS POOR WHO WANTS TO LEAN OVER TO THE GLOVE?
AS MENTIONED I DO NOT USE NOR NEED SIRIUS RADIO I DO NOT HAVE A CD PLAYER AND THAT I WOULD HAVE USED 
AS MENTIONED INTERNAL NOISE OF CAR INCREASES WHEN ON THE FREEWAY SO AS TO DROWN OUT MUSIC WHATEVER THE SOURCE

AS MENTIONED THE USB LOCATION AND AMOUNTS OF 
AS MUCH AS I PAID FOR CAR IT SHOULD HAVE CAME WITH BLUETOOTH VERY LAME
AS NOTED ABOVE I SPEND A LOT OF TIME PEERING AROUND THE DOOR FRAME AND HEADRESTS BEFORE I CHANGE LANES AS IN ALL CARS THERE S A BLIND SPOT BETWEEN THE CENTER AND SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS I CAN T SPEAK TO MY OWN CAR S VISIBILITY BUT THE MARKER 
AS NOTED EARLIER SHOULD RECOGNIZE PHONE NUMBERS STARTING WITH + FOLLOWED BY COUNTRY CODE 
AS NOTED IN PROBLEMS WITH AUDIO SYSTEM SECTION THE ACCESS TO THE SIX CD CHANGER IS POOR BECAUSE IT IS BLOCKED BY THE CUP HOLDERS AND THE CD CHANGER DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY CYCLE FROM ONE CD TO THE NEXT WHEN A CD IS COMPLETED AFTER USING THE CAR 
AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY THE OVERSIZED SIDE MIRRORS ARE GREAT FOR TOWING BUT THEY DO CREATE A BLIND SPOT AT TIMES
AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION CAPABILITY EITHER FAILS TO RECOGNIZE COMMANDS OR MISINTERPRETS THEM WHEN IT DOES THIS IS THE ONLY ASPECT OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I FIND UNACCEPTABLE 
AS NOTED WHEN DRIVING IN FREEZING DRIZZLE THERE WAS A BUILD UP ON BOTH THE WINDSHIELD AND WIPERS DESPITE HAVE SET A HIGH TEMP ON THE DEFROST AND HIGH FAN SPEED 
AS OLDER ADULT I LIKE THE FORWARD AND REAR VISIBILITY AND FEELING OF SAFETY
AS OLDER DRIVERS WE FIND THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE TO BE AN ADDITIONAL SAFETY ASPECT WE DON T WANT TO BE WITHOUT IT WAS EASY TO ADJUST TO FOR BOTH OF US AND REALLY HELPS ON LONG DRIVES 
AS OLDER PERSON IM NOT COMFORTABLE TAKING MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO TEND TO THE CONTROLS
AS OPPOSED TO THE TOUCHSCREEN ON THE HIGHER END WE APPRECIATE HAVING PHYSICAL KNOBS AND DIALS FOR CHANGING STATIONS AND ADJUSTING VOLUME
AS PERTAINING TO VOLUME ON BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE I USUALLY AM COMFORTABLE LISTENING TO RADIO AT ABOUT A 7 VOLUME HOWEVER WHEN MAKING CALLS I HAVE TO HAVE TO TURN RADIO VOLUME TO 30 HOWEVER AS OF YET I HAVE NOT INVESTIGATED TO SEE IF THERE

AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NOT A FAN OF THE AUTO WIPERS THE AUTO WIPERS ON MY OLD 2008 SAAB 9 3 WERE VASTLY SUPERIOR SEE THAT CAR AND COPY THAT MUCH EASIER TO USE AND WAY MORE ACCURATE EVERYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF VISIBILITY IS FINE
AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS DO NOT WARN DRIVER QUICKLY OF VEHICLES TO THE LEFT OF RIGHT 
AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED AT LEAST THREE UPCOMING MANEUVERS NEED TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN 
AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO BE ABLE EASILY TO TEMPORARILY MUTE VOICE DIRECTIONS FROM THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM

AS STATED EARLIER GOING FROM COUPE TO TRUCK WAS A HUGE TRANSITION THIS IS WHERE THE TACOMA SOARED MY COUPE WAS TERRIBLE IN THE WINTERTIME AND I FELT EXTREMELY UNSAFE MY CAR S ABILITY TO HANDLE SLICK SURFACES OR IF SOMEONE WAS TO HIT ME I DOUB 
AS STATED EARLIER SYSTEM REMINDS ME OF OLDER BMW SYSTEMS VEHICLE IS NOT DESIGNED FOR TODAY S ELECTRONICS NOT A NEGATIVE I GUESS BUT I BET THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT THIS IS THE LAST YEAR FOR THE XK I LOOK FORWARD TO THE UPDATED VERSION 
AS STATED EARLIER THE MAP COULD BE BETTER AS WELL AS THE SOUND 
AS STATED EARLIER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS THE WEAKEST LINK OF EVERYTHING THE CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT SOMETIMES TO USE AND NAVIGATE IN THE RADIO THE LIVE WEATHER FEATURE IS SUPER USEFUL HOWEVER 
AS STATED EARLIER THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT VISUAL DISTRACTION WHEN USING SIDE MIRRORS DURING DAYLIGHT DRIVING BECAUSE OF REFLECTION OF CHROME AROUND VENTS IN SIDE WINDOWS EVERY TIME I LOOK AT THE SIDE MIRRORS I SEE THIS REFLECTION AND MY BRAIN N 
AS STATED I AM STILL LEARNING TO USE THE MANY FEATURES NOT QIALIFIED TO REALLY JUDGE YET 
AS STATED ONCE A WEEK IT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL 
AS STATED PREVIOUSLY SIDE MIRRORS VISIBILITY ISSUES FOR A SHORT PERSON 
AS STATED PREVIOUSLY SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE AT NIGHT WHEN TURNING INTO DRIVEWAY NEEDS SIDE HEADLIGHT LIGHTING
AS STATED PREVIOUSLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM WILL CONSISTENTLY GET MY WIFE S NAME NICKNAME INCORRECT OR NOT FIND IT AT ALL YA YA MY CELL PHONE LEARNS WHAT I SAY AND IN MY ACCENT I WOULD EXPECT THE CAR TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS WELL 
AS STATED PRIOR HEADROOM IS LOW AND THE VISOR CUTS DOWN ON VISIBILITY WHEN THE VISOR IS IN USE 
AS STATER BEFORE THE HEADLIGHTS ARE TOO DIM OTHERWISE I WOULD GIVE SAFETY FEATURES AN OUTSTANDING GRADE 
AS STRANGE AS IT MIGHT SEEM TO YOU SOME OF US DO NOT HAVE I PHONES OR OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES NO NEED FOR ON STAR OR SIRUS RADIO OR OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES AM/FM RADIO IS ALL THE DISTRACTION I NEED 
AS THE SPEED INCREASES SO DOES THE VOLUME
AS THE VEHICLE WEIGHT IS LOW IT IS AFFECTED BY THE HIGH WIND AND PASSING VEHICLES WHEN IT IS IN FULL SPEED BY GIVING A SHAKE
AS USUAL BLIND SPOTS ARE AN ISSUE BUT THAT IS ON MOST CARS I DO HAVE THE WARNING SYSTEM AND IT WORKS GREAT
AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER THE THIRD ROW SEAT HEADRESTS DON T HAVE AN INTERMEDIATE POSITION THEY MUST BE EITHER FULL DOWN OR FULL UP 
AS WITH ALL 2 DOOR PONY CARS THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT THIS IS THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR HAVING THIS STYLE OF VEHICLE CAN T REALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT S NOT WHAT I D REALLY CALL A FAULT WITH THE CAR PER SE 
AS WITH ANY CAR THERE IS A BLIND SPOT POSITIONING THE MIRRORS MINIMIZES THIS 
AS WITH MOST BIGGER CARS IT S DIFFICULT TO TELL EXACTLY WHERE THE END OF THE HOOD AND TRUNK ARE SO GETTING INTO TIGHT PARKING SPOTS OR BACKING OUT IN TIGHT PARKING AISLES IS A CHALLENGE BUT MUCH EASIER BECAUSE OF THE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD BACKUP C 
AS WITH MOST COUPES CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO BE DONE SAFELY IF MIRRORS ARE NOT ADJUSTED PERFECTLY 
AS WITH MOST CREW CAB PICKUPS THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES HOWEVER THE BLIND SPOT MONOTERING SYSTEM ON MY NEW TRUCK IS WONDERFUL!
AS WITH MOST VEHICLES I VE ENCOUNTERED VOICE RECOGNITION 
AS WITH MOST VEHICLES THERE CAN BE A BLINDSPOT AT THE PASSENGER SIDE A PILLAR WHEN GLANCING TO YOUR RIGHT AT AN INTERSECTION A CAMERA MOUNTED IN THE PASSENGER REARVIEW DOOR MIRROR OR SIDEMARKER LIGHT AREA AND A MONITOR MOUNTED ON THE INSIDE O 
AS YOU GET OLDER IT GETS HARDER TO TURN TO LOOK BEHIND YOU THE BACKUP CAMERA HELPS WITH THIS I FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE 
AS YOU LOOK OUT THE FRONT WINDSHIELD YOU CAN SEE A GRID PATTERN INFUSED IN THE GLASS POSSIBLY FOR UV PROTECTION?? ITS ONLY NOTICEABLE IF YOU POINT OF VISION REFERENCE IS TOO NEAR 
ASH TRAY
ASIDE FROM AFORE MENTIONED THINGS I WOULD PREFER THE HOOD BE SLOPED MORE DOWNWARD FROM THE WINDSHIELD TO THE FRONT OF THE FRONT OF THE HOOD WHICH WOULD PROVIDE BETTER VISIBILITY WHEN PARKING TO REPEAT I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE ROOM BEHIND THE S 
ASIDE FROM THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE FUSE TO THE IPHONE VIA THE USB THE SYSTEM IS GREAT FOR A STOCK SYSTEM
ASIDE FROM USING THE BACKUP CAMERA WHICH I DONT USUALLY DO SIGHTLINES FOR REVERSE AND SIDE VIEWS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS I WOULD LIKE
ASIDE FROM VEHICLE SIZE VISIBILITY WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN SELECTING THIS VEHICLE WE ARE APPROACHING 70 YEARS OF AGE AND FEEL WE NEED ALL THE VISUAL AND TECHNOLOGY FEATURES AVAILABLE THE BACK UP CAMERA WAS A MUST AND THE BLIND SPOT ALERT HIGHLY 
ASKED AND ANSWERED
ASKED FOR DIRECTIONS TWICE BOTH WERE WRONG DIRECTIONS 
ASKING IF I NEED HELP EVERY TIME I TRY TO GIVE A VOICE COMMAND
ASSIGNING AUDIO STATIONS
ASSIST FEATURE
ASSUMING AWD IS A SAFETY FEATURE THE INFINITI SYSTEM IS WONKY UNLESS I M DOING SOMETHING WRONG MY ALL WHEEL DRIVE DIDN T KICK IN UNTIL I WAS ALREADY IN A SLIDE ACCORDING TO THE SALES PERSON IT SHOULDN T HAVE EVEN GOTTEN TO THAT POINT 
AT 5 4 I AM NOT TALL ENOUGH TO SEE THE FRONT END OF THE CAR I HAVE TO GUESS WHERE IT IS WHEN PULLING IN 
AT A CERTAIN POINT OF THE VISOR S ANGLE THE INTERIOR LIGHT ON THE VISOR COMES ON AND BECOMES A DISTRACTION IF TRAVELING INTO THE SUN FEATURE IS OK AT NIGHT BUT NOT DURING THE DAY 
AT AN INTERSECTION SOMETIMES THE FRONT PASSENGER POST BLOCKS VIEW OF A CAR TO THE RIGHT 
AT CERTAIN ANGLES THE POST BEHIND THE REAR DOOR MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN PULLING OUT FROM AN ANGLE 
AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME SORT OF AN EXTENSION OF THE SUN VISOR TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE WINDOW TO COVER THE AREA BEHIND THE INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
AT CERTAIN TIMES WHEN STOPPED AND READY TO MAKE A TURN SOMETHING FLASHES FROM INSIDE THE CAR THAT HAS CAUSED ME TO STOP ABRUPTLY THINKING ANOTHER CAR IS COMING 
AT FIRST I COULDN T GET MY PHONEBOOK TO CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH I SPENT SEVERAL HOURS TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK UNSUCCESSFULLY FINALLY AFTER RESEARCHING ON THE INTERNET I LEARNED THERE WAS AN APP I NEEDED TO DOWNLOAD/INSTALL/PAY FOR JUST $2 00 
AT FIRST I DIDN T THINK I LIKED THE SEAT VIBRATIONS BUT I GOT USED TO THEM 
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE REAR CAMERA AND THE SIDE CAMERA WERE PRETTY DUMB ON SUCH A SMALL VEHICLE I DRIVE COMMERCIAL TRUCKS REGULARLY BUT AFTER USING THEM I VE FOUND THAT BOTH ARE GREAT OPTIONS AND I USE THEM CONSTANTLY THE SIDE VIEW CAMERA I 
AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK WHEN USING MY IPHONE THRU BLUETOOTH WHEN I AM JUST STARTING TO LEAVE A VOICEMAIL MESSAGE IT SAYS MESSAGE DELETED PLEASE RE RECORD AND THEN MAKES ME START MY MESSAGE OVER THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED WITH MY IPHONE EXCEPT WHE 
AT LOUDER VOLUMES THE SPEAKERS CRACKLE SOME
AT MY AGE I NEED ALL THE VIEWING SPACE POSSIBLE AROUND THE VEHICLE ESPECIALLY TO THE REAR 
AT NIGHT I FEEL THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE LIGHT SHOULD BE BETTER I DO NOT WANT TO START GOING HOME BY 8PM 
AT NIGHT THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW REFLECTS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE WHICH CAN BE CONFUSING AND REALLY DANGEROUS 
AT NIGHT THE HEADLIGHTS POINT IN THE DIRECTION I M TURNING 
AT THE END OF THE DAY GARMIN AND MY PDA PHONE HAVE ABOUT THE MOST INTUITIVE OPERATION�VEHICLE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS ARE TOO LAWYERED UP!!!
AT THE PRICE POINT OF THIS VEHICLE I AM THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED THAT MY SRD 4 RUNNER DOES NOT HAVE AND CAN NOT HAVE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS INSTALLED FURTHERMORE IT DOES NOT HAVE BACKUP SENSORS I FIND IT UNBELIEVABLE THAT I HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER 
AT THE PRICE WE PAID FOR THIS VEHICLE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH A BACK UP CAMERA WE HAD TO PURCHASE AN AFTERMARKET BACK UP CAMERA 
AT THIS POINT I BELIEVE THAT BLUE TOOTH CONNECTIVITY SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE IN EVERY VEHICLE 
AT THIS PRICE POINT I THINK NAV SHOULD BE STANDARD 
AT THIS TIME I DON T USE THIS FEATURE SO I CANNOT GIVE A GOOD ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION 
AT TIME THE SOUND IS GARBLED I DON T KNOW IF THIS IS THE CAR OR THE CELL PHONE I HAVE 
AT TIMES CUMBERSOME TO USE AND THE MIC FOR HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS DOES NOT PRODUCE GOOD SOUND ON THE OTHER END OF THE CALL
AT TIMES DEPENDING ON THE ANGLE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE PAST THE FRAME IN BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW
AT TIMES DUE TO THE DRIVER S SIDE HEADREST AND THE WINDOW BAR BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR SEAT THERE MAY BE A BLIND SPOT THAT MIGHT HIDE AN OVERTAKING VEHICLE 
AT TIMES IT HAS DIFFICULTY RECOGNIZING MY VOICE PROBABLY MY ACCENT 
AT TIMES IT IS HARD TO HEAR I THINK IT IS EITHER THE STATION OR THE SPEAKERS 
AT TIMES IT IS HARD TO SEE VEHICLES IN BACK OF ME WHEN DRIVING
AT TIMES IT S HARD TO SEE IN THE BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE EVEN WHEN TURNING AROUND TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS THERE THERE S ALSO A VERY PRESENT BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT I MAY HAVE TO PURCHASE THE SMALLER MIRRORS TO GO ON THE SIDE MIRRORS 
AT TIMES IT WOULD BE GOOD IF SUN VISORS COULD BE LOWERED BY 1/2 INCH TO BLOCK OUT SETTING SUN OR RISING SUN 
AT TIMES NAVIGATION SYSTEM GIVES COMMANDS AT THE LAST MINUTE AND THEREFORE IT IS NOT SAFE TO FOLLOW 
AT TIMES REAR VIEW MIRROR ON PASSENGER SIDE SEEMS TO GET IN THE WAY OF MY VIEW
AT TIMES THE BLUETOOTH IS PROBLEMATIC 
AT TIMES THE SUN VISORS ARE WHOLLY INADEQUATE THEY NEED TO BE LONGER OR HAVE EXTENSIONS THE CAR SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT DETECTION I LIKED THE VEHICLE A LOT OVERALL BUT FELT THAT I HAD TO REPLACE IT WITH A SECOND VEHICLE WITH ALL WHEEL CONTROL 
AT TIMES WHEN TRYING TO A DIAL THE UNIT DOESN T RECOGNIZE THE NAME/DESTINATION I M TRYING TO SAY I WOULD SUGGEST INSTALLING MORE MICROPHONES PREFERABLY CLOSER TO THE DRIVER

AUDI IS BEHIND IN PROVIDING A STATE OF THE ART AUDIO SYSTEM 
AUDI S IN GENERAL ARE BUILT LIKE TANKS AND I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE 
AUDI S MMI SYSTEM IS AN INDUSTRY BEST THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE IS ONE OF THE BEST AVAILABLE AND IS PART OF WHAT PUTS THE LUXURY IN LUXURY SPORT SEDAN 
AUDI SHOULD JUST BUY GARMIN NAVIGATION NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY 
AUDIBLE ROUTE GUIDANCE
AUDIO
AUDIO / RADIO CHANNEL CONTROL IS TERRIBLE PREFER TO HAVE THIS BE EASILY SET VIA THE KNOB CONTROL VS THE MOUSE BASED CONTROL VERY DIFFICULT TO GET TO THE DESIRED CHANNEL AND PLEASE ONCE THE SATELLITE XM SERVICE IS DISABLED I DON T WANT I 
AUDIO / SOUND BALANCING IN THE VEHICLE IS A BIT ODD DIFFERENT SOUND EXPERIENCES DEPENDING UPON WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE DRIVER S SEAT OR PASSENGER S SEAT MY WIFE AND I HAVE SPENT SOME TIME IN AN ATTEMPT TO BALANCE THE SOUND SO WE BOTH EXPERIENCE I 
AUDIO ADJUSTMENTS
AUDIO AND BLUETOOTH QUALITY
AUDIO AND CELL PHONE INTERFACE IS LESS THAT CLEAR AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY DEALER INDICATES THAT THE QUALITY CANNOT BE IMPROVED 
AUDIO AND CLIMATE CONTROLS TOO CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER AND IT WOULD BE NICE IF SIRIUS COULD REMEMBER ALERTED SONGS WITHOUT USING PHONE 
AUDIO AND ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS GREAT I DO NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM WISH I DID AND THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS OK
AUDIO BASS QUALITY
AUDIO BETTER WITH CD VS RADIO
AUDIO BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
AUDIO CAN BARELY UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING PHONE CALLS ARE RARELY LOUD ENOUGH AND CLEAR ENOUGH PERSON IN OTHER END OFTEN HAS ISSUES HEARING ME 
AUDIO CAN BE HEARD LOUDLY AND CLEARLY EVEN WITH TOP DOWN 
AUDIO CANNOT BE SHUT OFF ONLY MUTED 
AUDIO CLARITY AND AVAILABLE VOLUME
AUDIO CLARITY IS EXCEPTIONAL
AUDIO COMMAND NEVER UNDERSTANDS ME THE DISPLAY SCREEN OFTEN DIMS WITHOUT WARNING EVEN WHEN THE LIGHT IS CONSTANT 
AUDIO COMMAND SYSTEM FOR VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVING 
AUDIO COMMANDS
AUDIO COMMANDS ARE LIMITED THEY MAY BE BETTER THAN I KNOW IF SO OWNERS MANUAL IS NOT DESCRIPTIVE ENOUGH TO TELL ME HOW TO USE IT 
AUDIO COMMANDS ARE NOT ALWAYS HEARD MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH MY CELL PHONE
AUDIO COMMANDS TO NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM EASY TO USE
AUDIO COMMANDS WORK MUCH BETTER THAN MY AUDI
AUDIO COMMUNICATION AND ENTERTAINMENT VERY EASY TO USE THE STEERING CONTROLS ARE GOOD BUT COULD BE SLIGHTLY IMPROVED THE CONTROLS THAT ARE LOCATED BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL ARE SOMETIMES CUMBERSOME BLUETOOTH IS EXCELLENT VERY CLEAR AND EA 
AUDIO COMMUNICATION IS OF A VERY HIGH QUALITY
AUDIO COMMUNICATION NAVIGATION SCREENS COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
AUDIO COMMUNICATION WITH PHONE AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM
AUDIO CONNECT WITH MY PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH
AUDIO CONNECTION TO PHONE SOMETIMES DISCONNECTS WHEN SWITCHING AUDIO APPS ON THE PHONE 
AUDIO CONSOLE CONTROL CLUSTER IS TOO LARGE AND NOT VERY ATTRACTIVE 
AUDIO CONTROL
AUDIO CONTROL TOO FAR FROM DRIVER
AUDIO CONTROLLED ENTERING A ADDRESS 
AUDIO CONTROLS
AUDIO CONTROLS ARE ODD THERE IS NO PLAY BUTTON IPHONE CONNECTION IS SOMEWHAT BUGGY BUTTONS WORK DIFFERENTLY SOMETIMES SEEMS TO WORK DIFFERENTLY WITH DIFFERENT DEVICES 
AUDIO CONTROLS ARE OVERLY COMPLICATED CONTROLS SHOULD HAVE DEDICATED KNOBS RATHER THAN HAVING TO BE ACCESSED THROUGH THE NAV SYSTEM NAV SYSTEM CONTROLS ARE OVERLY COMPLICATED ALSO AND NOT NEARLY AS INTUITIVE AS SAY A GARMIN 
AUDIO CONTROLS ARE TOO LIMITED WHEN NOT STOPPED EVEN A PASSENGER CANNOT USE IT WELL 
AUDIO CONTROLS ARE UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED TOO MANY SELECTIONS MUST BE MADE TO CHANGE THE BASS LEVEL FOR EXAMPLE ALSO THE REQUIRED ACCEPT CLAUSE AT THE START OF EACH DRIVE IS INCREDIBLY ANNOYING 
AUDIO CONTROLS ARE VERY RETRO AND OLD LOOKING NOT MODERN AND NO TOUCH SCREEN LOOKS LIKE A 70S CAR 
AUDIO CONTROLS COULD BE CLOSER TO DRIVER THEY ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE DASHBOARD 
AUDIO CONTROLS EASY TO USE AND SPEAKERS ARE VERY GOOD 
AUDIO CONTROLS IT REQUIRES MULTIPLE SELECTIONS TO TOGGLE BETWEEN AM/FM/XM THERE ARE ONLY 6 PRESETS DISPLAYED AT A TIME IT WOULD BE NICE IF THESE ADVANCED SEQUENTIALLY MY WIFE S MINIVAN IS EASIER TO USE 
AUDIO CONTROLS NOT GOOD
AUDIO CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL
AUDIO CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL ARE GOOD TOUCH SCREEN NOT SO MUCH ALSO WHEN LISTENING TO AUDIO WHATEVER THAT BLUE PULSING SQUARE IS ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO READ THE TIME AND TEMP TAKE NOTE THAT I HAVE NOT YET TAKEN THE T 
AUDIO CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL COULD BE BETTER FOR EXAMPLE YOU CHANGE THE STATION ON LEFT SIDE AND HAVE TO USE VOLUME ON RIGHT IT WOULD BE EASIER ALL ON ONE SIDE ALSO THE ROLLING WHEEL SELECTOR IS HARD TO USE WHEN YOU CLICK TO SELECT 
AUDIO CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL SO THAT DRIVER DOES NOT HAVE TO TAKE HIS EYES OFF THE ROAD TO SELECT RADIO CHANNELS 
AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL
AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL 
AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE FINE BUT BUTTONS ON DASH DIFFICULT TO READ PARTICULARLY AT NIGHT TIME 
AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE NOT ADEQUATE OR DON T FEEL NATURAL THE AUDIO SYSTEM HAS A LITTLE DELAY AND I DON T LIKE THE FADE FEATURE WHEN FFD OF SONGS
AUDIO CONTROLS SHOULD BE MORE OBVIOUS BASS TREBLE FADER ETC 
AUDIO CONTROLS TOO MANY TOUCH/SLIDE OPTIONS NOT EASY TO OPERATE UNDER WAY YOU HIT A BUMP AND YOU CHOSE SOMETHING YOU DIDN T INTEND TOO BASS TREBLE ETC ADJ TOO COMPLICATED TO FIGURE OUT
AUDIO CONTROLS WHILE DRIVING ESPECIALLY SATELLITE RADIO 
AUDIO COULD BE BETTER COMMUNICATION ONLY WORKS WHEN IT WANTS TO 
AUDIO COULD BE CLEARER AND LOUDER ALTHOUGH I DO NOT HAVE THE MARK LEVINGSTON SAD FACE 
AUDIO CUSTOMIZATION IS TOO BASIC TREBLE AND BASS SYSTEM NEEDS MORE DEPTH AND RANGE POSSIBLY AN AMP 
AUDIO DISPLAY
AUDIO DISPLAY DOES NOT LET YOU SWITCH SOURCES ON THE SAME DISPLAY MUST GO TO ONE OR TWO MORE BEFORE BEING ABLE TO SELECT CAR INFO ON ENGINE IS NOT IN SYNC WITH BUILT IN DASH DISPLAY ONE SAY THE GAS ENGINE IS ON THE OTHER SAY IT IS NOT TOO LIT 
AUDIO DISPLAY USER INTERFACE IS NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED COMPARED WITH M B FOR EXAMPLE SIRIUS XM MENU COULD BE A LOT MORE REFINED 
AUDIO DOES NOT ADJUST PROPERLY TONE IS TOO HIGH IN TREBLE TOO LOW IN BASE ADJUSTMENT SEEMS TO HAVE LITTLE EFFECT 
AUDIO DOES NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND RESPOND TIME TOO SLOW

AUDIO IS EXCEPTIONAL! ESPECIALLY BLUETOOTH PHONE CALLS 
AUDIO IS GREAT ENTERTAINMENT IS GOOD COMMUNICATION IS TERRIBLE

BACK UP CAMERA TAKES GETTING USED TO BUT MAYBE NOT SUCH A GOOD THING LOOKING BEHIND SHOULD ALWAYS BE FIRST INSTINCT
BACK UP CAMERA VIEW IS HELPFUL 
BACK UP CAMERA WARNING MIRRORS
BACK UP CAMERA WOULD BE NICE 
BACK UP CAMERAS SHOUL NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF BACK UP WARNING SENSORS THEY PROVIDE TWO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS
BACK UP COLLISION SYSTEM AS WELL AS BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTME IS WONDERFUL THESE SHOULD BE STANDARD ON MOST VEHICLES

BACKUP CAMERA WITH THE RADAR PARK ASSIST IS AWESOME MY LAST VEHICLE I HAD THE REAR BUMPER REPLACED ONCE AND PAINTED 3 OR 4 TIMES! IF I BACK INTO ANTHING WITH THIS CAR I SHOULD HAVE MY LISCENCE PULLED!! HID HEADLIGHTS ARE SOMETHING ID NEVER WANT T 
BACKUP CAMERA WITH VARIED OPTIONS IS A GREAT PACKAGE FEATURE 
BACKUP CAMERA WOULD BE NICE 
BACKUP CAMERA/DISPLAY IN REARVIEW MIRROR
BACKUP FEATURE
BACKUP LIGHTING COULD BE BRIGHTER FOR REARVIEW CAMERA TO BE A BIT BETTER PICTURE AT NIGHT

BAD THING IS THE FRONT PANELS ARE TOO WIDE BLOCKS YOUR FORWARD VISIBILITY
BAD VISIBILITY BACKING OUT OF ANGLE PARKING PLACE
BAD VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING OVER LEFT SHOULDER TO REAR
BAD WIPER BLADES
BALANCE
BALANCE CONTROL
BALANCE SOUND SO IT DOES NOT COMPETE WITH OUTSIDE NOISE
BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIO IS GREAT MAPS SYSTEM AND INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IS GREAT VOICE RECOGNITION IS PROBLEMATIC FOR THE ROUTE GUIDANCE WHEN I WOULD MOST LIKELY NEED IT LOST LOOKING AROUND AND WANTING TO VOICE COMMANDS 
BANG & OLUFSON PREMIUM SOUND PACKAGE SPEAKERS AND RADIO RECEPTION RANGE ARE BOTH OUTSTANDING 
BANG & OULFSEN SOUND SYSTEM
BANG AND OLUFSEN SOUND SYSTEM IS THE BEST I HAVE HEARD 
BAR BETWEEN FRONT AND BACK DOORS IS TOO WIDE CREATES A MAJOR BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER
BAR IN REAR WINDOW BREAKS THE WINDOW UP AND TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO
BARELY ANY CUSHIONING ON VERY HARD BUMPS
BARELY ANY EXTERIOR COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM
BARELY ANY REAR VISIBILITY IF THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SCREEN IS DOWN
BARELY WORKS CONSISTENT PROBLEMS
BARS ON LEFT AND RIDE SIDE OF WINDSHIELD ARE THICK AND CAN MAKE VIEWING PEDESTRIANS DIFFICULT AT TIMES 
BASE AUDIO IS OK BUT BOSE AND HIGH END SUDIO YOO EXPENDIVE FOR MY NEEDS 
BASE CHIRPS WHEN LEVEL IS TURNED UP PAST 1 OR 2 
BASE ENGINE POWER
BASE HD SOUND SYSTEM IS AWFUL SOUND IS MUDDLED AND UNPLEASANT TO LISTEN TO DUE TO VERY CHEAP AND INEFFECTIVE SPEAKERS I HAVE SPENT $2 500 UPGRADING IT

BASE MODEL AND BETTER THAN PREVIOUS VEHICLE SO NO COMPLAINTS 
BASE MODEL DOES NOT HAVE NAVIGATION
BASE MODEL NOT EQUIPPED WITH CRUISE CONTROL

BASE RADIO IS UNATTRACTIVE DISPLAY COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LARGER 
BASE RADIO NEEDS MORE POWER OR BETTER SPEAKERS OR BOTH
BASE RADIO NOTHING FANCY 
BASE SOUND GROUP 6 SPEAKER IS A LITTLE WEAK WOULD PREFER THE SG2 TO BE STANDARD ON A SCAT PACK
BASE SPEAKERS ARE ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE 
BASE SPEAKERS ARE PRETTY AVERAGE BUT THAT S OKAY THEY ARE THE BASE SPEAKERS AFTER ALL 
BASE STEREO SYSTEM IS NOT OF GREAT QUALITY UPGRADED OPTIONS WERE TOO PRICEY
BASE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE IS CHEAP IT SOUNDS CHEAP 
BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE THERE IS NO PERFECT NAV SYSTEM SO FAR THE ONE IN RR IS TRULY OUTSTANDING IF COMPARED TO OTHERS SAYING THIS MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE IS LARGELY LIMITED TO THE GERMAN MADE VEHICLES 
BASED ON MY HEIGHT I FIND THAT IF I MUST LOOK BACK OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER TO CHECK FOR TRAFFIC APPROACHING FROM MY RIGHT REAR MY LINE OF SIGHT IS OBSTRUCTED BY THE THE PILLAR BETWEEN THE RIGHT REAR DOOR AND THE RIGHT REAR CARGO WINDOW 
BASED UPON MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCES WITH PORSCHE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS A 1 000% BETTER
BASIC AM/FM RADIO NO CD PLAYER NO USB PORT AND PORTABLE CD PLAYERS OBSOLETE 
BASIC BUT EFFECTIVE 
BASIC MODEL HAS UNACCEPTABLE SOUND
BASIC PACKAGE IS PRETTY LIMITED
BASIC RADIO WITH SATEILITE NEEDS A LARGER DISPLAY
BASIC SIMPLE UNOBTRUSIVE EXACTLY WHAT I NEED NOTHING MORE OR LESS EASY 
BASIC SOUND SYSTEM QUALITY NEEDS MORE CONTROLS LIKE MID RANGE ETC
BASIC SYSTEM
BASIC SYSTEM NO OPTIONS MUCH BETTER THAN IN THE PAST
BASIC TRANSPORTATION
BASS
BASS OUTPUT OF THE VERY EXPENSIVE BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIO SYSTEM IS SOMEWHAT WEAK OVERALL AUDIO QUALITY AND ACCURACY INCLUDING BASS IS EXCELLENT JUST NOT AS IMPACTFUL AS SOME OTHER HIGH END SYSTEMS 
BASS RESPONSE/VOLUME FROM THE FACTORY SUBWOOFER COULD BE IMPROVED 
BASS SEEMS TO OVERWHELM FACTORY WOOFERS SUBWOOFER MIGHT TAKE SOME OF THE STRAIN OFF OF THEM 
BASS SPEAKER VIBRATES A BIT TOO MUCH
BASS/TREBLE/SOUND SETTINGS COULD BE MORE ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE CERTAIN TRACKS ON THE IPOD NEED MORE FINE TUNING TOUGH TO GO INTO SOUND SETTINGS EACH TIME THAN HAVING TO SWITCH SCREENS BACK TO NAVIGATION WITH EVERY SONG

BE NICE TO HAVE AN EXTENDER PIECE ON THE SUN VISOR 
BE SURE THAT THE RADIO VOLUME CONTROL IS ON THE STEERING WHEEL NOT THE DASH 
BEAM BETWEEN DRIVER DOOR AND REAR PASSENGER DOOR REDUCES FULL VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES 
BEATS AUDIO CAN T WAIT FOR WARM WEATHER TO TURN UP THE VOLUME WITH THE WINDOWS DOWN AND THE SUNROOF OPEN!
BEATS AUDIO ROCKS!!!
BEATS BASE SYSTEM BIG NAVIGATION DISPLAY FULLY COLORFUL DISPLAY

BEAUTIFULLY APPOINTED INTERIOR
BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED
BECAUSE DRIVING POSITION IS LOW DIFFICULT TO SEE THROUGH OR AROUND LARGER/TALLER VEHICLES IN FRONT WHEN IN STOPPED/SLOW TRAFFIC COMES WITH THE [SPORTS CAR] TERRITORY THOUGH 
BECAUSE I AM A TALL INDIVIDUAL 6 5 I HAVE TO BE SURE NOT TO GET TOO CLOSE TOO A STOP LIGHT I VE GOTTEN TOO CLOSE TO THE SOLID WHITE LINE AT THE STOP LIGHT AND HAVE NEEDED TO BEND FORWARD TO SEE THE LIGHT 
BECAUSE I AM SHORT 5 5 IT IS SOMETIMES HARD FOR ME TO CORRECTLY JUDGE WHERE THE FRONT OF THE CAR IN RELATION TO A CURB STOP 
BECAUSE I AM SHORT I COULD USE SUN VISORS THAT EXTEND LOWER HAS ANYONE EVER THOUGHT OF PUTTING ON A FLIP DOWN EXTENSION?
BECAUSE I AM SHORT I FEEL THE SIZE OF THE CAR AND THE SEAT ADJUSTMENTS GIVE ME GOOD VISIBILITY 
BECAUSE I AM SHORT THE SUN VISOR DOES NOT GO LOW ENOUGH I HAVE ADJUSTED THE SEAT AS HIGH AS I CAN AND STILL KEEP DISTANCE UNDER THE STEERING WHEEL SO I CAN MOVE MY LEGS FOR THE PEDALS 
BECAUSE I AM SO SHORT 5 AND SHORT WAISTED I HAVE TO SET MY SEAT AT MAXIMUM HEIGHT AND STILL HAVE LIMITED VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD IMMEDIATELY AROUND MY CAR I AM ALWAYS UNEASY WHEN I DRIVE 
BECAUSE I CAN CONNECT MY PHONE TO THE CAR I DON T USE ANY OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS I PREFER THE OPTIONS I HAVE ON MY PHONE THE AUDIO QUALITY AND SOUND SYSTEM ARE TOP NOTCH THOUGH 
BECAUSE I CAN GET MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC EASILY
BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE THE BACK UP WARNING SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME BLIND TYPE SPOTS WHEN REVERSING 
BECAUSE I HAD TO PICK ONE
BECAUSE I HAVE THE SPORT STEERING WHEEL THE OF TUNING IS ON THE CENTER PANEL OK FOR OLD SCHOOL BUT NOT UP TO DATE CONVENIENT
BECAUSE I M UNDER 5 TO MOVE THE FRONT SEAT FAR ENOUGH FORWARD TO REACH THE PEDALS MAKES ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE TO CLOSE TO THE STEERING WHEEL SO I KEEP IT BACK SOME THEN MY FEET DO NOT SIT ON FOOT PEDAL COMFORTABLY ENOUGH TO RELAX MY FOOT SO MY L 
BECAUSE IT IS A CONVERTIBLE MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT BACK SIDE 
BECAUSE IT IS A CONVERTIBLE THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALLER AND IT S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS USE OF THE CAMERA IS A MUST 
BECAUSE IT IS A CONVERTIBLE WHEN TOP UP IS WHEN VISIBILITY DURING LANE CHANGES IS LIMITED
BECAUSE IT S A CONVERTIBLE VISIBILITY IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM ONCE THEIR ARE REAR CAMERAS AND ELECTRONIC LANE AND SIDE SENSORE THAT WILL ALLEVIATE THESE ISSUES
BECAUSE IT S A LIGHTER VEHICLE THE FEAR OF COLLISION DAMAGE IS MY ONLY ISSUE 
BECAUSE IT SAID TO PICK 3
BECAUSE MY PHONE IS PAIRED WITH THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM IT WILL NOT ALLOW MESSAGE TONE TO BE PLAYED I NOTICED THIS WHILE RIDING IN THE CAR NOT DRIVING AND REALIZE THAT ITS A GREAT FEATURE FOR WHEN YOU ARE THE DRIVER BUT THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO T 
BECAUSE MY PHONE IS PAIRED WITH THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM IT WILL NOT ALLOW MESSAGE TONE TO BE PLAYED I NOTICED THIS WHILE RIDING IN THE CAR NOT DRIVING AND REALIZE THAT ITS A GREAT FEATURE FOR WHEN YOU ARE THE DRIVER BUT THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO TELL
BECAUSE OF HOW THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK SITS LOWER THEN THE BACK YOU SEE MORE THEN I WOULD LIKE OF THE TAIL GATE IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
BECAUSE OF LIMITED VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES THE WARNING SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE AND IS REALLY GREAT FEATURE 
BECAUSE OF LOCATION AND SIZE OF DRIVERS EXTERIOR MIRROR THERE A BLIND SPOT WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN
BECAUSE OF LONG WHEELBASE RELATIVE TO LENGTH OF CAR BACK END SOMETIMES GOES OVER CURBS I FIND THE BACK UP CAMERA TO BE AWESOME WITH A NICE WIDE ANGLE FOR ANYTHING CROSSING YOUR PATH LIKE VEHICLES GOING PERPENDICULAR TO YOU WHEN BACKING OUT OF 
BECAUSE OF MY HEIGHT 6 1 I HAVE MY SEAT BACK AND LOOKING OUT THE SIDE WINDOW AREAS I HANE TROUBLE SEEING AROUND THE SEAT HEADS AND BODY OF THE VEHICLE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS 
BECAUSE OF MY HEIGHT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW EVEN WHEN SITTING ON PILLOWS HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY ANY OF THE OTHER SAFETY FEATURES THE IMPALA HAS I VE ADJUSTED MY SEAT AND USE MY PILLOWS TO GET AROUND NOT ABLE T 
BECAUSE OF REAR SEAT HEADREST VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS POOR
BECAUSE OF ROAD NOISE THE PERSON THE DRIVER IS CALLING WITH THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION CAN T UNDERSTAND OR HEAR THE DRIVER SO THE DRIVER MUST YELL AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS ITS EASIER JUST TO HOLD THE PHONE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WON T LET T 
BECAUSE OF THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS WHEN CHANGING LANES ON THE HIGHWAY ALSO THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS SEEM TO BE SMALLER GOING BACK TOWARD THE TRUNK HATCH 
BECAUSE OF THE CAR S DESIGN VISIBIKITY CANNOT REALLY BR IMPROVED THAT MUCH
BECAUSE OF THE COMPACTNESS OF THE CAR YOUR VISIBILITY ON THE SIDES WILL BE WORSE THAN AVERAGE BUT THEY COMPENSATE FOR THIS WAS THE MODIFIED SIDE MIRROR
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH PROFILE IT DOES FEEL CROSS WINDS I DON T DRIVE IT AS FAST AS OTHER VEHICLES I VE HAD WHICH MAY NOT BE A BAD THING 
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ABILITY TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND PART OF THE SYSTEM I GIVE IT AN AVERAGE THE REST OF THE SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO HAVE TO REPEAT AND VERY DISTRACTING OVER AND OVER YOUR COMMANDS WHILE TRYING TO DRIVE 
BECAUSE OF THE LARGE SIZE OF THE FRONT ROOF SUPPORTS WITH AIR BAGS AND PLACEMENT OF THE SIDE MIRRORS IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE BLIND SPOTS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT 
BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT WEIGHTNESS OF THE VEHICLE I FEEL SIDE WINDS QUITE WELL ALSO SEMI S PASSING CAN GIVE ME A GOOD PUSH SIDEWAYS 
BECAUSE OF THE LONG SLOPING FRONT WINDSHIELD YOU HAVE TO LEAN UP TO SEE THRU WINDSHIELD WHEN MAKING RIGHT AND LEFT TURNS BECAUSE THE SIDE SUPPORT POST FOR THE WINDSHIELD BLOCK YOUR VIEW 
BECAUSE OF THE LOW HEAD ROOM THE SUN VISOR IS DIFFICULT TO MOVE TO THE SIDE IT CAN HIT ME IN THE HEAD IF I AM NOT CAREFUL 
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE VEHICLE PRIMARILY ITS INTERIOR SIZE THE STOCK SOUND SYSTEM IS JUST ADEQUATE A HIGHER END SOUND SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE BUT AT AN INCREASED COST MAYBE BETTER STOCK SPEAKERS IN THE FRONT WOULD BE NICE MOST OF THE TIM 
BECAUSE OF THE RATHER LARGE HEADRESTS IT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO SEE BACK 
BECAUSE OF THE SEATING POSITION MY HEAD IS VERY CLOSE TO THE B PILLAR BLOCKING MY VIEW TO THE SIDE OF THE CAR
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE IT PROBABLY FEELS A TAD CLAUSTROPHOBIC INSIDE AT TIMES AND WHEN THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE PASSENGER SEAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET A GOOD SIGHT PROJECTION THROUGH THE RIGHT WINDOW REAR WINDOW LOOKS GREAT OUTSIDE BUT DOES NOT A 
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE MIRRORS BLIND SPOTS ARE ACCENTUATED AND IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES! I HAD TO INSTALL CONVEX SAFETY MIRRORS I WONDER WHETHER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE FIXED 
BECAUSE OF THE SMALL BACK WINDOW IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS IN THE BLIND SPOT 
BECAUSE OF THE VEHICLE S BLIND SPOTS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING IS CRITICAL AND APPRECIATED
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE CAR IS DESIGNED IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW USING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I AM 6 FOOT AND MY EYE LINE WHEN LOOKING IN THE MIRROR IS DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH THE REAR INTERIOR ROOF A FRIEND WHO IS SHORTER DID NOT HAVE T 
BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT AND SOLID FEEL OF THE CAR I FEEL COMPLETELY SAFE OR AT THE VERY LEAST IF IN AN ACCIDENT THE BODILY DAMAGE WOULD BE AT A MINIMUM 
BECAUSE OF VEHICLES LOWNESS LARGER MIRRORS WOULD BE GOOD
BECAUSE OF WIDE POSTS IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS FROM THE SIDES HOWEVER THIS CAR HAS THE SAFETY FEATURES WHICH I WANTED SO IT PRETTY MUCH TAKES CARE OF THE BLIND SPOTS 
BECAUSE REAR VISIBILITY IS SO POOR LARGER MIRRORS OR MULTI VIEW MIRRORS WOULD BE HELPFUL CHANGING LANES EVEN WITH LCA IS DIFFICULT IN CONGESTED TRAFFIC OR BAD WEATHER 
BECAUSE THE CAR IS SO SMALL THE SUN VISORS ARE BASICALLY NOT EFFECTIVE AT ALL THEY ARE JUST TOO SHORT!!
BECAUSE THE CRISP OF THE SOUND AND HOW SILENT THE NOISE LEVEL IS OUTSIDE
BECAUSE THE FAN RUNS ALL THE TIME THIS CREATES NOISE SO PHONE CALLS AND LISTENING TO MUSIC IS NOT AS GOOD AS IF THE RAN WAS NOT ON
BECAUSE THE HEADRESTS ARE SO POSITIONED IN THE BACKSEAT THERE IS A SMALL WINDOW TO SEE WHAT IS BEHIND MY CAR THE HEADRESTS ARE TOO HIGH ALSO EVEN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE DIFFICULT TO SEE IF I CAN CHANGE LANES I HAVE ASKED THE PERSON IN T 
BECAUSE THE MANUAL IS ON CD I HAVE NOT LEARNED TO USE THE VOICE COMMANDS VERY WELL I WORK ON A COMPUTER ALL DAY I WANT TO READ MY NON WORK ITEMS FROM PAPER I BELIEVE THAT IF I READ THE MANUAL I WOULD FIND THE NAV SYSTEM AND VOICE CONTROLS M 
BECAUSE THE REAR OF THE CAR SITS HIGHER THAN THE FRONT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN BACKING UP 
BECAUSE THE REAR WINDOW SEEMS SMALLER THAN OUR PREVIOUS CRV THE HEADRESTS OF THE REAR SEATS OBSTRUCT THE VISION OUT THE REAR THE GOOD NEWS IS THE HEADRESTS FOLD DOWN WHEN NOT IN USE 
BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS TALLER THAN MOST OTHERS IT IS HARD TO DETECT A VEHICLE IN YOUR BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE I DON T HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH MY TRUCK BECAUSE I M FORCE TO USE THE MIRRORS BECAUSE THE VISIBILITY IS SO BAD THE JEEP GIVES ME A 
BECAUSE THE VEHICLE SEEMS EXTRA WIDE I ALWAYS GIVE ENOUGH ROOM TO THOSE COMING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION ON NARROW STREETS SOMETIMES I MUST STOP TO DO THAT 
BECAUSE THE VEHICLE SITS HIGH PARKING SPACES ARE HARD TO SEE AND SOMETIME I HAVE TO REALIGN THE CAR TO FIT THE SPACE
BECAUSE THE WINDOW IN THE BACK IS SMALLER THAN WINDOW IN THE FRONT IT HARD TO SEE WHEN BACKING UP
BECAUSE THIS VEHICLE IS A HATCHBACK IT SUFFERS FROM LESS THAN EXCEPTIONAL HEAD TURN VISIBILITY THE MIRRORS MAKE UP FOR THIS VERY WELL BUT IT COULD BE A CONCERN FOR SOME DRIVERS 
BECAUSE VIEW IS BLOCKED BY HEADREST VISIBILITY IS POOR OUT BACK WINDOW
BECAUSEE OF THE SIZE OF THE PATHFINDER PARKING TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO I WISH THAT PARKING ASSIST WAS ON MY PATHER I WONDER IF IT IS RETRO FITTABLE? I LOVEE MY PATHFINDER!

BEING A CONVERTIBLE IT DOES HAVE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACES TO SEE IF OTHER CARS ARE COMING

BEING A MUSIC PRODUCER I SOMETIMES USE MY VEHICLE TO GET THE OVERALL SOUND QUALITY OF MY MIXES I CANNOT DO THIS WITH THE DODGE CARAVAN 
BEING A SHORT PERSON 5 2 SOMETIMES THE DOOR/WINDOW POSTS PROVIDE A CHALLENGE WHEN TRYING TO LOOK OVER A SHOULDER TO CHECK BLIND SPOTS 
BEING A SHORT PERSON 5 3 I HAVE A LITTLE DIFFICULTY SEEING OVER THE DOOR LOOKING TOWARD THE GROUND BECAUSE THE BELTLINE IS PRETTY HIGH ALSO AS WITH MOST VEHICLES LIKE THIS THE SMALL REAR SIDE WINDOW DOES NT HELP VISIBILITY PROPERLY ADJUSTED 
BEING A SMALL CAR VISIBILITY FOR OTHER BIGGER VEHICLES IS A CONCERN ONE REASON I CHOSE BRIGHT YELLOW

BOSE UPGRADE WITH SUBWOOFER IS TOO BOOMY SOMEWHAT UNDAMPED BASS RESPONSE WORST BOSE SYSTEM MY 2004 350Z BOSE SYSTEM IS MUCH MUCH BETTER BUT BEST IS MY 1996 LEXUS LS400 AUDIO SYSTEM WHICH IS PIONEER SYSTEM 
BOTH ARE ALREADY NOTED 1 THE SIDE VISOR HITS THE DRIVER SEAT HEADREST WHEN I ATTEMPT TO PULL IT DOWN 2 THE AUTO SETTING ON THE FRONT WIPERS SEEMS INCONSISTENT 
BOTH IN MY GM CORVETTE AND MY PAST LEXUS THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM AS FAR AS OPERATING WHILE DRIVING GOES WAS VASTLY SUPERIOR IN EASE OF OPERATION AND LOGIC OF SYSTEM CONTROL 
BOTH SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL THEY COULD BE A LITTLE BIT WIDER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
BOTH SUN VISORS SHOULD HAVE BUILT IN SLIDER PANELS TO COVER MORE AREA 
BOTH SUNVISORS NEED TO BE EXTENDABLE TO COVER THE WHOLE TOP HALF OF FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE WINDOWS AND ALSO THE WINDSHIELD
BOTH VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY ARE GOOD BUT I AM MORE IMPRESSED BY THE DRIVING SAFETY THAT IS EXCEPTIONAL THAN THE VISIBILITY THAT IS AS EXPECTED 
BOTHERSOME WHEN DRIVING AS TAKES EYES OFF ROAD
BOTTOM OF REAR WINDOWS RISE UP MAKING THE VIEW SMALLER VISIBILITY TAKES GETTING USED TO PILLARS IN FRONT ARE LARGER THAN MY LAST CAR VISIBILITY TAKES GETTING USED TO 
BOTTOM OF TOUCH SCREEN AWKWARD TO REACH 
BOTTOMS OUT OF ALMOST EVERY DRIVEWAY

BRIGHTS ARE NOT UP TO PAR?
BRIGTNESS OF CLUSTER AND NAVIGATION DISPLAY AT NIGHT WOULD BE NICE THERE WAS AN AUTO DIMMING FEATURE ALSO WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A TAILGATE DOWN WARNING ONE TIME I DID NOT CLOSE TAILGATE SECURELY AND IT DROPPED OPEN IN TRANSIT 
BRING BACK DIALS! TOO HARD TO CHANGE STATIONS WHEN YOU RE DRIVING E G TRY TO GET FROM XM STATION 8 TO XM STATION 9 AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A MESSAGE TO READ WHILE YOU RE TRYING TO DRIVE AND YOU HAVE TO HIT OK AND MAYBE YOU WILL GET STATION 9 IT

BSTTERY IN KEY DIED AFTER 7 WEEKS 
BT CELL CONNECTION EXTREMELY CLEAR
BT CONNECTION WAS BETTER ON MY TOYOTA CAMRY I HAVE HAD MANY COMPLAINTS FROM FAMILY MEMBERS/FRIENDS WHEN COMMUNICATING FROM BT WITHIN CAR 
BUBBLE/BLIND SPOT SHOULD BE LOCATED ON THE INTERIOR EDGE OF MIRROR
BUCKET SEATS IN THE MIDDLE
BUDGET VALUE
BUFFERING OF BACK GROUND NOISE FOR THOSE I AM TALKING TO THEY SAY THERE IS ALOT OF NOISE AND ECHOBACK OF VOICE 
BUILD
BUILD IN A 1ST TIME USER TUTORIAL FOR THE SYSTEM AND SET UP FEATURES
BUILD IN THE SCREEN
BUILT IN BLUE TOOTH
BUILT IN BLUE TOOTH IS A HUGE CONVENIENCE FOR ME AND THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS GREAT FOR BEING STOCK AND NON NAME BRAND

BUILT IN BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE AND TEXT MESSAGES CAN LISTEN WHILE CONCENTRATING ON DRIVING 
BUILT IN BLUETOOTH SYSTEM FOR MY PHONE THE SATELLITE RADIO IS WONDERFUL TO LISTEN TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD AND EASY TO FOLLOW 
BUILT IN CELLULAR CONNECTIVITY IS VERY SLOW GOOGLE SEARCH IS USELESS GIVEN HOW SLOW THE TMOBILE CONNECTION IS

BUMPY RIDE ON FREEWAY
BURKE IS TERRIBLE AUDIO IS THE BEST SOUND I VE EVER HEARD 
BURMEISTER SYSTEM VERY NICE SOUND CONTROLS ACCEPTABLE TO USE 
BURMESTER SOUND SYSTEM IS AWESOME
BUTTONS & NOT TOUCH SCREEN 
BUTTONS ARE NOT WELL LAID OUT ON DASH AND TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE NEEDS RETHINKING 
BUTTONS CLOSE TO EDGE OF SCREEN SOMETIMES HARD TO HIT OR GET TO WORK 
BUTTONS COULD BE PROTRUDED MORE FOR RADIO
BUTTONS FOR RADIO STATIONS ARE TOO SMALL OR IN A BAD LOCATION TOP OF SCREEN WHEN DRIVING IT IS SOMETIME DIFFICULT TO TOUCH WOULD BE NICE FOR VOLUME CONTROLS ON FRONT OF STEERING WHEEL INSTEAD OF IN THE BACK 
BUTTONS ON STEERING WHEEL ARE TOUCHED TO EASY WHEN TURNING
BUTTONS ON TOUCH SCREEN WAY TOO SMALL / BUNCHED UP TOGETHER TOO CLOSE SOUND OF MUSIC VIA ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM AVERAGE AT BEST 
BUTTONS TOO SMALL ENTERING LOCATIONS INTO NAV TERRIBLE
BUTTONS TOO SMALL TOUCH SCREEN TOO SENSITIVE
BY FAR THE BEST AND EASIEST NAVIGATION TO USE OF ALL CARS I HAVE OWNED 
BY FAR THE BIGGEST FACTOR TO PULL THIS AVERAGE DOWN IS THE POOR QUALITY SOUND SPEAKERS IN THIS VEHICLE 
BY HAVING A BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
BY INTERPRETING BETTER THE COMMANDS
BY THE WAY ALL SOUNDS ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO ME SO I ONLY CAN PUT DOWN RATING TO MOVE TO NEXT PAGE I AM DEAF I DO NOT USE SOUND RELATED STUFF AT ALL IN MY CAR SO EVERYTHING RELATED IS N/A

CALLERS CANNOT HEAR ME WHEN USING HANDSFREE TAKES TOO LONG TO LOAD ADDRESSES FOR NAVIGATION I JUST USE APPS ON MOBILE PHONE 
CALLERS CANNOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING FROM DRIVER S END DURING CELL PHONE BLUETOOTH CONVERSATIONS

CALLERS ON BLUETOOTH SAY THERE IS EXCESSIVE ROAD NOISE AS IF I HAVE A WINDOW OPEN WHEN AT INTERSTATE SPEEDS IN TRAFFIC 
CALLERS SAY THEY SOMETIMES CAN NOT UNDERSTAND ME WHEN TALKING BUT I AM HEARING THEM CLEARLY MICROPHONE COULD BE BETTER
CALLERS TELL ME THEY CANNOT EVEN TELL THAT I AM ON HANDS FREE IN MY CAR THE SOUND AND CLARITY IS SUPERIOR
CALLERS TREND TO ASK ME TO SPEAK LOUDER SO THEY CAN HEAR ME WHICH RESULTS IN ALMOST A YELL SPEAKER QUALITY IS POOR IN THE MID TO LOW RANGE 
CALLING A CONTACT IN MY PHONE REQUIRES TOO MANY VOICE COMMAND STEPS
CALLING OR RECEIVING CALLS SOUND QUALITY IS LESS THAN DESIRABLE ESPECIALLY WITH COMPARISON TO THE SOUND SYSTEM OF THE RADIO 
CALLING SOMEONE WITHOUT TOUCHING ANYTHING!

CAPABILITY OF MOVIES TO PLAY ON SCREEN
CAPABILITY TO ELIMINATE APPLICATIONS FROM MENU THAT I DO NOT USE

CAR IN GENERAL
CAR IS A BIT TOO SMALL MORE LIKELY FOR PASSENGERS TO GET INJURED IF GETTING HIT BY A BIGGER CAR
CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE GOOD VISIBILITY WITH THE TOP DOWN 
CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE HAD TO TAKE OUT THE WIND SCREEN BETWEEN THE TWO REAR HEADRESTS SO I COULD SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOW WITH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE VISIBILITY IS SLIGHTLY LESS WHEN TOP IS UP!
CAR IS A COUPE WITH LONG SIDE WINDOWS SO WHEN YOU PULL VISORS TO THE SIDE THEY NEED TO EXTEND FURTHER BACK TO KEEP SUN OUT OF YOUR EYES FROM THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW THEY PULL OUT A LITTLE BIT BUT NOT ENOUGH LOOKS LIKE THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM F 
CAR IS A DREAM COME TRUE
CAR IS A STRIPPER IT OFFERS VERY MUCH FOR THE BASE PRICE

CAR IS LOW IN SIZE BUT EFFICENT
CAR IS NEW SO I HAVE NOT YET FULLY EXPLORED AND UTILIZED ALL OF THE COMMUNICATIONA RELATED FEATURES I AM STILL LEARNING 
CAR IS NOT ALL WHEEL DRIVE
CAR IS PERHAPS SLIGHTLY TOO BIG AND TOO HEAVY OTHERWISE GREAT!
CAR IS SO SMALL AND VISIBILITY IS GREAT
CAR IS TERRIFIC
CAR IS TOO NEW TO RATEE
CAR IS TOOO SMALL
CAR IS VERY WELL MADE
CAR LACKS CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT AS IN OTHER UPSCALE AUTOS 
CAR LOCKS DO NOT LOCK AS SOON AS CAR IS IN DRIVE
CAR MISUNDERSTANDS WHAT I SAY OFTEN EVEN WHEN SPEAKING LOUD AND CLEAR

CAR ON BLIND SPOT SYSTEM
CAR PHONE CONNECTS TO CELL PHONE HANDSFREE

CD JUMP BETWEEN SONGS
CD LIBRARY ABLE TO RECORD CD S INTO THE LIBRARY AND NOT HAVE TO KEEP THE DISCS IN THE CAR
CD PLAYER
CD PLAYER ACCESS TO BLUE TOOTH
CD PLAYER AND 4 SPEAKERS

CD PLAYER!!!!!!!!!!! I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IT DID NOT HAVE ONE 
CD PLYER DOES NOT ACCEPT SOME CD

CD STORAGE FUNCTION 
CD TRANSFER TO HHD NEEDS SOME FINE TUNING PERHAPS ALL CD S WOULD BE RECORDED TO HHD WITH OPTION TO ERASE 
CDS WITH INFO ON SONGS OR ARTISTS CAN BE UPGRADED WITH APP THAT APPLYS THIS INFO WITH A PICTURE OF THE ALBUM COVER DISPLAYED SO YOU ALWAYS HAVE THIS INFO TO SEARCH WITH!
CELL PHONE AUDIO QUALITY WHEN PLAYING THROUGH VEHICLE AUDIO IS NOT VERY GOOD OFTEN CHOPPY UNREADABLE AND YOU MUST TURN UP THE VOLUME TO HIGH LEVELS TO HEAR THE CALLER 
CELL PHONE AUTOMATION THROUGH VEHICLES SYSTEM
CELL PHONE BLUE TOOTH
CELL PHONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION SEEMS TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH EITHER CONNECTIVITY OR WITH AMBIENT NOISE ALSO PHONE VOLUME IS TOO LOW UNKNOWN IF SYSTEM HAS A PROBLEM OR IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY 2011 OUTLANDER BLUETOOTH CONNECTION 
CELL PHONE COMMUNICATION
CELL PHONE CONNECTIVITY
CELL PHONE CONNECTIVITY ABILITY TO LISTEN TO MUSIC FROM CELL PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH TO ANSWER CALLS HANDS FREE AND AUDIO QUALITY OF THOSE CALLS 
CELL PHONE CONNECTIVITY AND PHONE BOOK INTEGRATION
CELL PHONE CONNECTIVITY WORKS VERY WELL 
CELL PHONE HANDS FREE & THE WAY THE CELL PHONE AUTOMATICLY CONNECTS TO THE SYSTEM
CELL PHONE QUALITY IS AVERAGE TO POOR HOWEVER WE DON T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS A VEHICLE PROBLEM BLUETOOTH OR CELLULAR PROVIDER CREDO MOBILE DEFICIENCY 
CELL PHONE RECEPTION FOR HANDS FREE CALLING IS POOR TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS AT BOTTOM OF SCREEN ARE HARD TO GET AT
CELL PHONE SOUND AND RECEPTION 
CELL PHONE THE USED HANDS FREE I LIKE THAT INCOMING & OUTGOING CALL AND TEXT NO NAVIGATION DO LIKE AUDIO AM FM SYSTEM
CELLULAR HOT SPOT CONNECTIVITY
CENTER ARM REST LOW
CENTER CONSOLE
CENTER CONSOLE STORAGE
CENTER CONSOLE STYLE
CENTER CONTROLS CONSOLE COULD BE ANGLED UP MORE 
CENTER DISPLAY ON DASH WHEN USING SATELLITE RADIO DOESN T FULLY DISPLAY ARTIST OR SONG 
CENTER HEADREST IN BACK PRECLUDES SEEING OUT THE BACK WINDOW
CENTER MIRROR CAN OBSTRUCT SIGHT LINES
CENTER OF GRAVITY
CENTER PHONE STORAGE SLOT
CENTER PILLAR LIMITS SIDE VISIBILITY 
CENTER POST IS IN LINE OF SIGHT AT TIMES WHEN PULLING OUT HAVE TO LOOK AROUND FRONT OR BACK OF POST 
CENTER POST MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO LOOK RIGHT AT 3 AND 4 AND 5 O CLOCK
CENTER POST WHEN CHANGING LANES
CENTER POSTS BETWEEN DRIVER AND BACK SEAT CREATE BLIND SPOTS
CENTER REAR CAMERA CANNOT BE ACTIVATED WHILE DRIVING WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IN FULL CARGO SITUATIONS 
CENTER REAR VIEW MIRROR APPEARS UNREASONABLY TOO CLOSE AND OUT OF SYNC WITH REAR VIEW CAMERA AND SIDE MIRRORS
CENTER REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL 
CENTER SEAT ADJUSTMENTS
CENTRAL CONTROL NICE LARGE FONTS FOR INFORMATION TEXT LAYOUT ON SCREEN IS CLEAR AND LARGE AND INTUITIVE 
CENTRAL LOCATION OF MOST ALL CONTROL ON TOUCH SCREEN LARGE SCREEN
CENTRAL ON SCREEN CONTROLS ARE A LITTLE COMPLICATED AND NOT ALWAYS INTUITIVE 
CENTRALIZE THE SPEAKER PICK UP FOR USE WITH THE MOBILE PHONE AND ONSTAR SO THE PASSENGERS VOICE IS PICK UP BETTER THE SPEAKER PICK UP IS CURRENTLY POSITIONED ABOVE THE DRIVERS SIT 
CERTAIN ANGLES THROUGH THE REAR RIGHT WINDOW CANNOT BE SEEN OVER THE DRIVER S RIGHT SHOULDER AS THEY ARE BLOCKED BY THE PASSENGER SEAT
CERTAIN STATIONS DON T COME IN VERY WELL AT ALL 
CHA CHA CHA RADIO SINGS CHA CHA CHA
CHALLENGER FEELS VERY SAFE BE IT IN TOWN OR ON THE FREEWAY AT SPEEDS 
CHALLENGING TO BACK UP WITHOUT BACKUP CAM 
CHANGE FLAT BUTTONS ON STEERING WHEEL AUDIO CONTROLS FOR MORE SIGHTLESS TACTILE FEEDBACK 
CHANGE MOUSE
CHANGE NAVIGATION INTERFACE TO ALLOW FULL CONTROL BY PASSENGER WHILE VEHICLE IS MOVING IMPROVE NAVIGATION INTERFACE AND EASE OF USE IN GENERAL MORE LIKE GARMIN AND KENWOOD 
CHANGE PHONE SYSTEM SO THAT IT CAN RECOGNIZE 2 DIFFERENT PHONES AND ANSWER EITHER ONE MY PARTNER S PHONE NUMBER WAS ENTERED FIRST INTO SYSTEM IF MY PHONE RINGS AND HE IS IN THE CAR SYSTEM WILL NOT PICK UP MY PHONE EVEN THOUGH MY NUMBER WAS EN 
CHANGE STATION ON STEERING WHEEL NOT JUST CHANGE BETWEEN FAVORITES LIST
CHANGE THAT DIAL TO ENTER LETTERS AND NUMBERS IT S RIDICULOUS 
CHANGE THE AUDIO SYSTEM BEFORE AN ACCIDENT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BUTTON TO HIT WHILE DRIVING 
CHANGE THE DIAL VIEW ON THE SCREEN TO A DIGITAL IMAGE OF THE STATION PLAYING
CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU MUST REMOVE A DESTINATION AFTER ARRIVAL THAT IS ONCE YOU ARRIVE HAVE THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY REMOVE THE DESTINATION SO THAT THE DIRECTIONS DON T KEEP ON BEING GIVEN VIA THE PROVIDED VOICE 
CHANGE THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM PRIMITIVE AND VERY SLOW
CHANGE THE SCREEN SO IT ROTATES A LITTLE SO IT FACES THE DRIVER BETTER RATHER THAN DIRECTLY TO THE CENTER 
CHANGED OUT THE HEAD SO IT S HARD TO RATE THIS ACCURATELY 
CHANGING CD PLAYER TO HOLD ONLY ONE CD INSTEAD OF SIX ON THE HOME SCREEN YOU CAN EITHER SHOW THE MONTH AND DATE WHERE BEFORE YOU WOULD SEE TIME AND DATE 
CHANGING CHANNELS
CHANGING CHANNELS ON RADIO HAVE TO LOOK AT SCREEN WHILE DRIVING DANGEROUS ASPECT
CHANGING DEVICES ON TOUCH SCREEN UOLD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
CHANGING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT LANE HAS A BLIND SPOT AS EXPECTED WITH ALL HATCHBACK S VERY EASY TO OVERCOME WITH SIDE VIEW MIRROR ADJUSTMENT!
CHANGING FROM ONE AUDIO SOURCE TO ANOTHER
CHANGING FROM ONE DEVICE TO ANOTHER IS EASY 
CHANGING FROM ONE FUNCTION TO ANOTHER SHOULD BE MORE INTUITIVE REQUIRES TOO MUCH ATTENTION WHILE DRIVING 
CHANGING LANE WARNING SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE ESPECIALLY FOR THE LEFT SIDE 
CHANGING LANES B PILLAR VERY LARGE AND PRODUCES A LARGE BLIND SPOT 
CHANGING LANES CAN BE DIFFICULT BLIND SPOT IS TRICKY 
CHANGING LANES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IS A PROBLEM THE VISIBILITY WHEN YOU LOOK BEHIND TO THE LEFT IS ZERO THE ADDITION OF THE ROUND BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE LEFT SIDE MIRROR HELPS BUT GETS SOME GETTING USED TO 
CHANGING LANES GOOD ONLY BECAUSE OF ALERT PICTURE ALERT SYSTEM FOR OUT OF LANE AND COLLISION I CAN NOT COUNT ON IT 
CHANGING LANES IS DIFFICULT ON THE LEXUS RX 350 THE SIDE WINDOWS ARE TINTED AND THE WINDOW DIVIDERS BLOCK VISIBILITY VISIBILITY FROM THE FRONT IS VERY GOOD BUT I VE ALWAYS FELT THAT SIDE VISIBILITY IS ONLY AVERAGE 
CHANGING LANES TO RIGHT CAN E DIFFICULT DUE TO BLIND SPOTS BODY PARTS INADEQUATE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR 
CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT REVEALS A BLIND SPOT IN THE RIGHT REAR CORNER OF THE CAR 
CHANGING LANES VISUAL COULD BE BETTER
CHANGING MAP RANGE IS EASY JUST A TURN OF A KNOB AND THE ADDITIONAL DISPLAY TOMTHENRGHT OF THE SPEEDOMETER IS GREAT FOR TURN BY TURN DIRECTIONS I ALSO HAVE A 2011 PORSCHE CARRERA S THIS NAV SYSTEM IS DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTI 
CHANGING OR ACCESSING RADIO STATION NOT PREPROGRAMMED USE OF GOOGLE MAPS ACCESSING AND UTILIZING CELL PHONE MUSIC PRIOR AUDI WOULD JUST PICK UP ANYTHING I WANTED TO USE FROM MY PHONE NO SWITCHING TO MEDIA ETC 
CHANGING PAGES TO CHANGE STATIONS
CHANGING RADIO STATION IS DIFFICULT WHEN DRIVING
CHANGING RADIO STATIONS
CHANGING RADIO STATIONS DIFFICULT DUE TO LOCATION AND NOT CLEARLY MARKED CONTROLS BUTTONS ARE BLACK WITH DARK NUMBERS VERY HARD TO SEE!
CHANGING RADIO STATIONS REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE TOUCH BUTTON/SCREEN ACTION WHICH CAN BE DISTRACTING WHEN DRIVING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE MOST OF THE TIME I GIVE UP ON IT AND A FEW TIMES IT S TOTALLY FAILED ME IN PROVIDING AN 
CHANGING SATELLITE RADIO CHANNELS IS RIDICULOUSLY HARD I M AFRAID WE WILL BREAK THE BUTTONS BEFORE WE ARE READY TO GET A NEW CAR 
CHANGING STATIONS AND CHANGING FROM AM TO FM TO SIRIUS IS OVERLY COMPLICATED 
CHANGING STATIONS BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL NOT CHANGING BETWEEN AM/FM/SIRUS SO EASILY ON THE STEERING WHEEL JUST CHANGING STATIONS 
CHANGING STATIONS DIFFICULT SWIPING FEATURE IS TERRRIBLE
CHANGING STATIONS ON RADIO COULD HAVE SYSTEM LIKE TOYOTA PRIUS
CHANGING TEMPATURE
CHANGING THE AUDIO SOURCE SHOULD BE EASIER AND THE LABELING OF SATELLITE STATIONS SHOULD USE THE NAMES OF THE STATIONS AND NOT JUST THEIR CHANNEL NUMBER 
CHANGING THE DOUBLE CLICK FEATURE TO CHANGE CHANNELS ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO A SINGLE CLICK 
CHANGING THE MAP SCALE ON THE NAV SYSTEM
CHANGING THE RADIO/ENTERTAINMENT FEATURES NEEDS TO BE MORE INTUITIVE IF YOU ACTIVELY USE MORE THAN 6 STATIONS THEN IT S A HASSLE TO CHANGE CYCLE THROUGH STATIONS AND USING THE MOUSE IS A LOT MORE DISTRACTING THAN TOUCHING THE SCREEN 
CHANGING THE STATE WHEN PROGRAMMING THE GPS IS TEDIOUS AND I TRAVEL IN A TRI STATE AREA REGULARLY 
CHANGING TO LEFT LANE WHILE DRIVING IS A NIGHTMARE THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT DRIVER CAN NOT SEE ANYTHING ON THE LEFT THROUGH REAR WINDOW 
CHANGING VOLUME OF AM SIGNAL WHEN IT CUTS IN AND OUT OF HD
CHANNEL ADVANCE ON STEERING SEARCH FOR SATELLITE RADIO Q IDENTIFYING ARTIST
CHANNEL AND VOLUME CONTROLS ON BOTH SIDES
CHANNEL SELECTION COULD BE BETTER 
CHANNEL SELECTION COULD BE IMPROVED BY SPACING THEM FURTHER APART 
CHANNEL SELECTION VIA THE TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY FRUSTRATING
CHARGE CELL PHONE WITH KEY OFF BE NICE TO HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
CHARGER FOR IPHONE NEW VERSIONS 
CHARGERS HAVE A BAD BLIND SPOT
CHARGING THE VEHICLE
CHEAP EASY TO BREAK PLASTICS 
CHEAP LEASE
CHEAP PLASTIC UNPADDED SOLID SUN VISORS EXPECTED BETTER 
CHEAP SPEAKERS FOR SUCH A CAR
CHEAP SUN VISORS 
CHEAPER BUILT IN WIFI!
CHECK OUT THE AUDIO SYSTEM ON THE PORSCHE CAYENNE THIS IS MY OTHER SUV AND THE SYSTEM IS MUCH BETTER
CHECK THE LANES BEFORE CHANGING DRIVERS MIRROR COULD STAND TO HAVE THE EURO SPLIT MIRRORS
CHECKING BLINDSPOTS IS A BIT AWKWARD FOR ME 
CHECKING ONCOMING TRAFFIC FROM THE RIGHT WHEN MAKING LEFT TURNS IS SOMETIMES A LITTLE LIMITED BECAUSE OF WIDE B PILLAR ON PASSENGER SIDE 
CHECKING THE BLIND SPACE ON THE DRIVERS SIDE HAVING TO COMPLETELY TURN TO CHECK
CHECKING THE BLIND SPOT CAN BE TRICKY UNTIL YOU GET USED TO DRIVING THE CAR 
CHEVROLET HAS A PROBLEM WITH LARGE BLIND SPOTS ON THEIR SUV S MAYBE ALL SUV S HAVE THE PROBLEM
CHEVROLET SHOULD UPGRADE THE SPEAKERS AS THEY SOUND BASIC/LIMITED 
CHIPPED PAINT ON BUMPER
CHOICE OF COLORS BACKGROUNDS IN THE DISPLAY
CHOICE OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC YOU CAN LISTEN TO 
CHOICE OF FASTEST SHORTEST ROUTES AT ADDRESS ENTRY
CHOICE SO MANY ALTERMNATIVES
CHOOSING THE STATIONS AND SHORING THEM IS DIFFICULT
CHOSE JEEP BECAUSE THE WINDOW VISIBILITY IS GREAT NEW DRIVERS IN OUR HOUSEHOLD SO WE WERE LOOKING FOR LARGER WINDOWS
CHOSE THE C MAX BECAUSE IT RIDES A BIT HIGHER THAN A PASSENGER CAR BUT STILL HAS THE FEEL AND COMFORT OF A PASSENGER CAR MY LAST VEHICLE WAS A FORD ESCAPE AND FEEL THE C MAX PROVIDED THE ROAD VISIBILITY OF THE ESCAPE WITH THE COMFORT OF A PASSEN 
CHROME ACCENT AROUND VENTS REFLECT IN SIDE WINDOWS WHEN LOOKING AT SIDE MIRROR MAKING FOR A SIGNIFICANT DISTRACTION WHEN TRYING TO USE MIRRORS
CHROME RINGS AROUND THE DASH VENTILATION OUTLETS
CHROME TRIM AROUND AIR VENTS REFLECTS BADLY ONTO SIDE VIEW MIRRORS FRONT PILLARS DETRACT FROM DRIVER S VIEW OF ROAD ESPECIALLY ON TURNING
CHROME TRIM ON BLACK DASH REFLECT SUNLIGHT ONTO WINDSHIELD

COMING FROM A 2004 EXPEDITION THERE CERTAINLY SEEM TO BE BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY WHEN CHANGING LANES I AM VERY GLAD I HAVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM

COMMAND RECOGNITION
COMMAND RECOGNITION IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT
COMMANDING CAN BE UNNECESSARILY TEDIOUS FOR EXAMPLE IF AN ARTIST HAS JUST ONE ALBUM HARD DISK IPHONE IT SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY SELECTED INSTEAD OF MAKING YOU SELECT IT ALSO THE TACTILE FEEL OF THE CENTER COMMAND KNOB IS CLUMSY 
COMMANDS ARE TOO LIMITING I SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE LESS COMMANDS TO GET TO WHAT I WANT AND HAVE IT KNOW MORE WAYS TO GET THERE 
COMMANDS FOR CALL SOMETIMES NOT UNDERSTOOD MOST OF TIME I AM NOT IN TRUCK LONG ENOUGH TO USE ALL FEATURES 
COMMANDS TO LONG AND UNABLE TO SHORT STEP VOICE COMMANDS A RETURN TO PRIOR MENU I E INFINITI BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD BE NICE
COMMENTED EARLIER THAT FORWARD VISION DOWN AND TO EACH SIDE IS SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED FRONT PILLARS ARE TOO LARGE AND NOT WELL SITED AND HOOD RISES TOO HIGH

COMMUNICATION COULD BE SIMPLER TO USE SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND A COMMAND ALSO WISH I COULD USE TOUCH SCREEN WHILE SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND SOMEONE ELSE IS DRIVING 
COMMUNICATION I CAN SPEAK INTO SPEAKERS TO CALL SOMEONE KEEP EYES ON THE ROAD ENTERTAINMENT I CAN LISTEN TO THE MUSIC I ENJOY MOST 
COMMUNICATION IS EASY AND RECEPTION IS CLEAR 
COMMUNICATION MAKING PHONE CALLS IS TOO TIME CONSUMING THERE ARE LONG PAUSES BETWEEN VOICE COMMANDS AND MULTIPLE STEPS I ALWAYS STOP THE VEHICLE AND DIAL DIRECTLY FROM THE PHONE IF I HAVE TO MAKE A CALL AS THERE ENTERING NUMBERS BY VOICE OR S

COMMUNICATION RECEPTION DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ADDRESSES VERY WELL NEED TO BE SO DETAILED IT TAKES AS MUCH TIME TO ENTER DIRECT RATHER THEN VERBAL 
COMMUNICATION SCREEN
COMMUNICATION SOMETIMES DOESN T UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING 
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM DOES NOT PICK UP VOICE COMMANDS AND ALWAYS GETS THEM WRONG TOO FRUSTRATING TO USE I ALSO DON T LIKE HAVING TO PLUG MY PHONE INTO USB IN ORDER TO USE THE INTERNET FEATURES
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN THE STEERING WHEEL IS ANNOYING IT IS VERY SENSITIVE AND TURNS ON SOMETIMES WHEN I STEER REALLY STARTLED ME THE FIRST TIME SINCE I DIDN T KNOW WHAT IT WAS NOW JUST ANNOYING WHEN IT COMES ON WHILE I M STEERING
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS CONVENIENT TO OPERATE AND EFFICIENT 
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND OPERATE WHILE DRIVING
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED VOICE QUALITY AND ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE VOICE 
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM VOICE ACTIVATION
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WITH CONNECTIVITY DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY SO DON T KNOW IF IT WORKS 
COMMUNICATION TO BE MORE CLEAR 
COMMUNICATION TOUCH DISPLAY IS SIMPLY NOT USER FRIENDLY 
COMMUNICATION USE STANDARD BUTTONS AND COMMANDS EXAMPLE TOYOTA S NAVIGATION REDESIGN LEARN FROM MARKET LEADERS SUCH AS GARMIN NO NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL 
COMMUNICATION WITH IPHONE MUSIC IS SLOW AND CLUNKY DASH DISPLAY UPDATE OF SONG TITLE IS SLOW TO UPDATE SOMETIMES AND IT HAS FROZEN SEVERAL TIMES DURING USE AND I HAVE HAD TO RECONNECT THE PHONE AND POWER CYCLE THE RADIO TO CLEAR IT OUT 
COMMUNICATION WITH THE HANDS FREE PHONE & RADIO 
COMMUNICATION& ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM S 
COMMUNICATION/BLUE TOOTH VOICE NOT CRISP AND CLEAR SOUNDING

COMPARE THE NAV AND THE APPS TO THOSE IN IOS AND YOU WILL KNOW WHY THEY ARE SO BAD 
COMPARED TO 2006 YEAR MODEL THE CURRENT NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS WAY TOO COMPLEX AND MOST FEATURES ARE TOO DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING 
COMPARED TO A JAPANESE CAR ITS A SECONDARY THOUGHT IT IS THERE AND IT WORKS BUT IT DOESNT BLOW YOU AWAY 
COMPARED TO MAZDA 3 HEARING INCOMING CALLS AND NAVIGATION INSTRUCTIONS IS NOT AS CLEAR 
COMPARED TO MY OLD CAR 2 DOOR 92 HONDA ACCORD THE VISIBILITY IS A BIT WORSE PARTICULARLY FOR LANE CHANGES WITH THE DOOR SEPARATOR IN PLACE THERE I THINK THIS WOULD BE TRUE OF ANY 4 DOOR CAR THOUGH COMPARED TO A 2 DOOR 
COMPARED TO MY PREVIOUS CAR 2001 BMW 325I THE AUDI SEEMS TO HAVE MORE/BIGGER BLINDSPOTS ESPECIALLY THE ONE CREATED BY THE B PILLAR ALSO I M STILL GETTING THE HANG OF PARKING BECAUSE SIDE AND REAR VISIBILITY ARE LIMITED NOT SURE IF IT S THE 
COMPARED TO OTHER LUXURY CARS THE RANGEROVER SPORT IS FAR SUPERIOR
COMPARED TO PREVIOUS TAURUS DECREASED VISIBILITY OUT OF FRONT WINDOW
COMPARED TO SIMILAR VEHICLES HONDA ACCORD IT APPEARS TO BE UNDER POWERED WHEN ACCELERATING ON THE FREEWAY THE ENGINES WHINES FOR SOMEONE 6 FOOT OR TALLER IT POSES SOME DIFFICULTY GETTING IN WITHOUT BUMPING ONES HEAD TOOK ME MANY TRIES 
COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER VEHICLES THAT I DROVE THIS ONE IS A MUCH EASIER TO SEE OUT OF ESPECIALLY FROM THE REAR AFTER DRIVING A 2011 CHEVROLET MALIBU FOR A FEW MONTHS WHILE CAR SEARCHING GRANDMOTHER S CAR THE INTERIOR VISIBILITY IS EXCE 
COMPARED TO THE BMW SYSTEM IT S A LITTLE KLUNKY AND LESS INTUITIVE THE BMW SCREEN NAVIGATION REMINDS ME OF MY IPHONE THE MB SCREEN TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO BECAUSE THE NAVIGATION ISN T AS LOGICAL SEVERAL TIMES I VE GOTTEN STUCK ON THE PHON 
COMPARED TO THE GIANT SUV S I VE ALWAYS DRIVEN BEING IN A CAR SEEMS LOWER TO THE GROUND AND THUS NOT AS SAFE IN GENERAL 
COMPARED TO THE MERCEDES SYSTEMS THE BMW IS A 12 AND THE MB A 2 
COMPARING AGAINST MY NON US VEHICLE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OVERALL WIDE VIEW OF THE ROAD FROM DRIVER SEAT BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS ALSO LESS IT TAKES GETTING USED TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS LESSER OVERALL VISIBILITY FROM ALL ANGLES 
COMPATABILITY WITH MP3 SCREEN IS TO BRIGHT NO CD PLAYER 
COMPATIBILITY W/ SMART PHONES/DOWNLOADING
COMPATIBILITY WITH I PHONE OPERATING SYSTEM IS AN ISSUE THE SYSTEM WILL NOT READ AND DISPLAY TEXTS 
COMPATIBILITY WITH IPHONE OR OTHER DEVICES 
COMPATIBILITY WITH IPOHNE 6 AND IPAD AIR 2
COMPATIBILITY WITH POPULAR PRODUCTS LIKE IPHONES
COMPATIBILITY WITH THE NEXUS 5
COMPLAINTS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHEN USING HANDS FREE THAT DIFFICULTY IN HEARING ME ETC OFTEN HAVE TO HOLD THE PHONE INSTEAD OF HANDS FREE QUALITY OF INCOMING CALL IS LESS THEN EXPECTED AS WELL THIS IS THE 2ND VENZA I HAVE HAD AND I DO NOT REME

DEALER COURSES ON OPERATION OF SYSTEMS PARTICULARLY SYNC
DEALER FORGOT TO MENTION THAT I HAVE NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM TEXTS DOESN T WORK TOOK AWHILE TO FIND OUT THAT IT USES IPHONE6 SO THE DEALER SAYS AFTERWARDS? I HAVE A IPHONE4S 
DEALER INSTALLED REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS NOT A BLU RAY HOWEVER THE PRICE WAS THAT OF TOP OF THE LINE PRODUCT 
DEALER SHOULD EXPLAIN THE USE OF THESE ITEMS TO CUSTOMER THE DEVICES ARE NOT AT FAULT
DEALER SHOULD HAVE TRAINING CLASSES AVAILABLE ONE TIME INTRODUCTION IS NOT ENOUGH TO REALLY GET TO ENJOY ITS CAPABILITIES 
DEALER TOLD HIM TO KEEP IN HEATED GARAGE IN WINTER THE CAR IS TERRIBLE IN THE SNOW ICE BUILDS UP ON THE TIRES AND WEARS THE TIRES OUT 
DECENT MILEAGE
DECENT PRICE FOR THE TYPE OF CAR
DECREASE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM TO MUCH OF A DISTRACTION FROM DRIVING JUST TO CHANGE A RADIO STATION

DEFOGGER
DEFROST VENTS ARE TOO HIGH UP ON THE FRONT WINDSHIELD SO WHEN IT IS COLD AND ICY THE DEFROST WILL NOT HEAT ALL THE WAY DOWN THE WINDSHIELD WHICH MAKES THE WIPERS FREEZE UP I THINK LOUVERS TO DIRECT THE AIR TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD MIGHT

DEPENDING ON HOW TALL YOU ARE IT CAN SOMETIMES BE DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS ON YOUR LEFT AT A STOP SIGN DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE SIDE MIRRORS 
DEPENDING ON THE ANGLE OF THE CAR IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE ONCOMING TRAFFIC 
DEPENDING ON WHAT MEDIA IS PLAYING THE SOUND DOESN T SEEM LIKE IT CAN GO LOUD ENOUGH THE SPEAKERS WORK BEST WHILE CONNECTING TO USB IPHONE 
DEPENDING YOUR HEIGHT I AM 5 7 THE SEAT WHOSE HEIGHT CAN T BE ADJUSTED MEANS IT S DIFFICULT TO FULLY SEE OVER THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT END OF THE CAR

DESIGN OF VERY SMALL REAR WINDOW RESULTS IN A BLIND SPOT ON SIDE OF VEHICLE
DESIGN OF WINDSHIELD AND DOOR GLASS CAN MAKE IT SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO SEE PEDESTRIANS AT ABOUT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE FROM DRIVER S POINT OF VIEW 
DESIGN VISORS MORE LIKE GM PRODUCTS WITH TWO VISOR ONE LEFT AND ONE STRAIGHT AHEAD AND ADJUSTABLE TO HANDLE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS 
DESIGNED FOR BETTER EASE OF USE
DESIGNED WELL FOR SHORTER PEOPLE TO SEE OVER THE DASH AND HOOD 
DESPITE ALL THE MIRRORS AND ANGLES I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO JUDGE DISTANCE OF OTHER VEHICLES AND I DON T TRUST BACKING OUT WITH THE BACKUP CAMERA I THINK THERE ARE STILL BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING
DESPITE BEING ON THE LOWER END OF WHAT IS OFFERED FROM JEEP THE AUDIO QUALITY IN MY WRANGLER UNLIMITED SURPASSES THAT OF SIMILARLY PRICED VEHICLES FROM OTHER MANUFACTURERS 
DESPITE THE TWO SECTION LEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR I FIND A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT THAT CANNOT BE ELIMINATED BY REPOSITIONING THE MIRROR OR DRIVER I THINK THAT THIS BLIND SPOT COULD BE ELIMINATED BY INCREASING THE ANGLE OF VIEW OF THE OUTER SECTION O 
DESPITE THIS CAR BEING LOWER TO THE GROUND I STILL FEEL TALL ENOUGH IN MY SEAT TO SEE WELL OUT OF THE FRONT AND BACK OF THIS VEHICLE

DIDN T COME WITH A CD PLAYER ONLY HAVE A RADIO 
DIDN T GET THE BESPOKE SYSTEM BUT WHAT IS IN THE VEHICLE IS FINE WITH ME 
DIDN T HAVE THE COLOR I WANTED
DIDN T LIKE THE ADDITION OF BLACK PLASTIC SUN VISORS THAT WERE ADDED TO THE EXTERIOR OF ALL OF THE WINDOWS THE ONE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE SEVERELY LIMITED VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY ON LEFT CURVES HAD THE DEALER REMOVE THE VISOR STRIP ON THE DRIVER 
DIDN T NOTICE UNTIL AFTER THE PURCHASE THAT THE VEHICLE DIDN T HAVE A CD PLAYER I DON T USE AN IPOD OR OTHER PLUG IN MUSIC DEVICE SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDY 
DIDN T PURCHASE MODEL WITH UPGRADED SYSTEMS
DIDN T THINK WE WOULD USE THE BACK UP CAMERA THAT MUCH LOVE IT!
DIDNT ORDER TOUCH SCREEN RADIO BECAUSE DIDNT WANT BACK UP CAMERA I PERSONALLY DONT SEE WHY THEY CANT BE SEPERATE BUT BASE RADIO WORKS FINE FOR ME

DUE TO THE LENGTH AND PITCH OF THE HOOD I FEEL THE FORWARD VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS ON PREVIOUS MODELS I FIND MYSELF RELYING MORE ON THE PARKING ASSIST CAPABILITIES OF THE VEHICLE RATHER THAN MY DRIVING CAPABILITIES 
DUE TO THE LENGTH OF THE VEHICLE IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR SIDES WHEN LOOKING FOR ONCOMING VEHICLES OR CHANGING LANES IN HIGH SPEED TRAFFIC
DUE TO THE NARROWER WINDOWS AND SIZE OF INTERIOR SEATING IN THE BACK IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK/SIDE WINDOWS WHEN MERGING INTO TRAFFIC OR CHANGING LANES 
DUE TO THE SHAPE OF THE VEHICLE THERE IS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES THAT REQUIRES ME TO USE THE SIDE MIRRORS AND THE PASSENGER TO HELP WITH VISIBILITY 
DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE AND PROPER KNOWLEDGE OF ADJUSTING MIRRORS EVERYTHING IS EASILY VISIBLE AND SAFELY DRIVABLE
DUE TO THE SMALL WIDTH OF THE CAR THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS TOO SMALL AND THAT GIVES BLINDSPOTS

ENJOYING SIRIUS RADIO FOR MLB INFO
ENJOYING THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT S CLEAR AND CONCISE WITH DIRECTIONS XM RADIO IS GREAT ALSO
ENLARGE THE SIZE OF THE ICONS USED TO OPERATE THE CONTROL SCREEN
ENSURING THAT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS AS UP TO DATE AS POSSIBLE ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT THE FIRST WEEK WE HAD THE VEHICLE WE WERE IN SEARCH OF A HARDWARE STORE BUT THE LOCATION WE WERE SENT TO WAS AN EMPTY STORE 
ENTAINMENT OS
ENTER YOUR PHONE NUMBER HERE
ENTER/EXIT
ENTERING A DESTINATION TAKES TOO MUCH TIME THERE ARE TOO MANY SCREENS AND IT S TOO CONFUSING ACURA DOES IT RIGHT 
ENTERING A DESTINATION THROUGH THE MANUAL OPERATION I E THE TOUCH CONTROL MOUSE PAD IS FRUSTRATING SLOW CUMBERSOME AND A REAL STEP BACK FOR LEXUS 
ENTERING A DESTINATION WHEN VEHICLE IS MOVING PASSENGERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS 
ENTERING ADDRESS IN NAVIGATION IS VERY HARD IT SHOULD BE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY
ENTERING ADDRESS IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND HAVING THE SYSTEMS UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING LOTS OF REPEATING WHICH IS FRUSTRATING
ENTERING ADDRESS WHILE DRIVING WITH ANOTHER PASSENGER
ENTERING ADDRESSES 
ENTERING ADDRESSES FOR GUIDED NAVIGATION SHOULD BE SIMPLY BY TYPING THE ADDRESS AND ZIP CODE 
ENTERING ADDRESSES IN GPS
ENTERING ADDRESSES IN THE NAV SYSTEM COULD BE MADE EASIER THAT MAY BE MY INEXPERIENCE WITH THE SYSTEM 
ENTERING ADDRESSES INTO NAV SYSTEM IS SLOW MAP SHOULD DISPLAY WITH DIRECTION TRAVELING UP NOT NORTH ALWAYS UP 
ENTERING ADDRESSES INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE I JUST USE MY IPHONE AND CALL IT A DAY MY LAST X5 HAD A SOMEWHAT BETTER UI FOR ENTERING ADDRESSES 
ENTERING ADDRESSES IS A SLOW PROCESS 
ENTERING ADDRESSES IS NOT VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD TOO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS ONE SIMPLE WAY WOULD BE EASIER
ENTERING ADDRESSES VIA VOICE INPUT OR CHARACTER INPUT IS DIFFICULT CUMBERSOME AND VERY FRUSTRATING 
ENTERING AN ADDRESS IN THE NAVIGATION IS CUMBERSOME AS IT SEARCHES THROUGH ALL STATES WITH THE SAME STREET IT SHOULD ALLOW USER TO LOOK ONLY IN THE SPECIFIC STATE 
ENTERING AN ADDRESS IS CUMBERSOME 
ENTERING AN ADDRESS VIA VOICE CONTROL FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS POOR VOICE COMMAND FOR A PHONE CALL TAKES TOO MANY STEPS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY SAY CALL BILL JONES IN ONE STEP RATHER IT FORCES YOU TO SAY CALL CONTACT WITH A DELAY THE Y 
ENTERING AND EXITING
ENTERING COMMANDS OR SEARCHING PINTS OF INTEREST ARE OFTEN TOO COMPLICATED 
ENTERING DESIRED DESTINATION IN NAVIGATION
ENTERING DESTINATION ADDRESSES IS REALLY PAINFUL AND IF IT HAS MULTIPLE LOCATIONS E G FRED MEYER IT IS DIFFICULT FROM THE DISPLAY TO ENSURE I M SELECTING THE CORRECT LOCATION UNTIL IT S TOO LATE AND I HAVE TO START OVER 
ENTERING DESTINATION INFORMATION ON THE GPS
ENTERING DESTINATION INFORMATION SHOULD BE EASIER AND QUICKER
ENTERING DESTINATIONS FOR NAVIGATION 
ENTERING DESTINATIONS IN THE NAVIGATION IS A PAIN BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE PARKED PASSENGER CANNOT ENTER THE ADDRESS AND I DON T LIKE HOW IT ELIMINATES LETTERS AS YOU GO IT WOULD JUST BE FASTER TO TYPE IT IN MANUALLY 
ENTERING DESTINATIONS WITH VOICE COMMANDS
ENTERING DRIVER SEAT
ENTERING HIGHWAY FROM A DRIVER S SIDE ENTRANCE IS NOT A PROBLEM WHEN THE ENTRANCE ROAD IS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE VISIBILITY IS POOR
ENTERING NAVIGATION DESTINATIONS 
ENTERING SUB MENUS CAN BE FRUSTRATING 
ENTERING THE ADDRESS FOR NAVIGATION IS CLUNKY WE HAD A GARMIN PREVIOUSLY AND I LIKED HOW GARMIN HAD US ENTER THE STATE FIRST ONLY THE FIRST FEW LETTERS WERE NECESSARY AFTER THAT IT MADE SUGGESTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM THEN THE STREET ADDRESS AG 
ENTERING THE DATA IS SLOW USING THE TOUCHSCREEN OPTIONS TO AVOID EXPRESSWAYS TOLLS OR THE DIRECT ROUTE NOT AVAILABLE AFTER THE ROUTE IS CALCULATED ALTERNATE ROUTES COULD BE SHOWN TO DECIDE WHICH ROUTE TO TAKE I DON T KNOW IF MY NAVI SYSTEM 
ENTERING THE DESTINATION INFORMATION FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS QUITE TIRESOME THE SLIGHT DELAY BETWEEN EACH LETTER INPUT DELAYS THE START OF THE JOURNEY TOO MUCH I HAVE RESORTED TO USING THE MOBILE APP WHICH HAS HELPED A LITTLE ALTHOUGH IT SO 
ENTERTAINMENT
ENTERTAINMENT BECAUSE I LIKE TO LISTEN TO OLDIES WHEN I DRIVE
ENTERTAINMENT CANNOT BE CONTROLLED FROM THE NAVIGATION SCREEN 
ENTERTAINMENT CONTROLS ARE TOO COMPLEX
ENTERTAINMENT IS BEST FOR ALL OUR ROAD TRIPS 
ENTERTAINMENT IS EASY TO USE AND READ
ENTERTAINMENT IS GREAT IT WOULD VE BEEN NICE TO HAVE A CD PLAYER 
ENTERTAINMENT SOMETIME CD POPS OUT EARPHONE DON T WORK VOLUME IS AN ISSUE SOMETIMES
ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM
ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS A BIT ANNOYING AS IT MUST PLAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE MENU BEFORE AUTOPLAYING PREVIOUS YEARS YOU COULD SELECT PLAY THIS WAS A MANDATORY CHANGE DUE TO SOME REGULATION PROHIBITING A DRIVER PRESSING THE PLAY BUTTON THIS IS 
ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY 
ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS GREAT 
ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS WAY TOO COMPLEX ESPECIALLY FOR NAVIGATING IPOD MENUS 
ENTIRE AUDIO SYSTEM SETUP
ENTIRE SYSTEM IS SLOW & A BIT TEDIOUS TO PROGRAM OR CHANGE RADIO STATIONS 
ENTRY AND EXIT
ENTRY AND EXIT COULD BE A LITTLE EASIER BUT I DON T KNOW HOW IT COULD BE EASIER AND STILL MAINTAIN THE CARS STYLING
ENTRY AND EXIT DIFFICULT
ENTRY AND SEARCH OF ADDRESS LOCATION OPTIONS
ENTRY EGRESS
ENTRY OF NAVIGATION DATA
ENTUNE COULD BE GOOD BUT YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY REFRESH THE APP NEEDS TO AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT AND WORK WITHOUT INTERVENTION USUALLY USE BLUE TOOTH ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE PHONE NOTIFICATION SOUNDS COME THROUGH WHEN IT IS CONNECTED REGARDLE 
ENTUNE IS TERRIBLE VOICE RECONCILIATION IS BASICALLY USELESS THE SPEAKERS ARE A POOR QUALITY 
ENTUNE REALLY MESSED UP THIS RATING TOO HARD TO CONNECT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ANOTHER APP WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE PANDORA YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE YOU PHONE S APP RUNNING IN ORDER TO PLAY YOU MUSIC 
EQ ON THE RADIO AND MORE POINTS OF INTEREST ON NAVIGATION
EQ SHOULD HAVE MORE CHOICES BASS IS NOT AS EXPECTED AND EQ SHOULD CONTROL ATLEAST 6 BANDS 
EQUALIZER ADJUSTMENTS FOR MUSIC BEYOND THE NORMAL BASS AND TREBLE PERHAPS PRE SET CATGEGORIES SUCH AS ROCK JAZZ CLASSICAL ETC 
EQUALIZER CONTROLS ONLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH CERTAIN RADIO FUNCTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE BASE/TREBLE FROM ANY AUDIO SYSTEM 
EQUALIZER FOR RADIO COULD BE UPDATED
EQUIPPED WITH XM/SIRUS RADIO
EQULIZER
ERGONOMICS
ERGONOMICS BAD AND USER INTERFACE IS VERY POOR TOO MANY STEPS AND COORDINATING 2 SCREENS AND MENU BUTTONS IS FAR TOO CONFUSING AND I AM TECH SAVVY MY WIFE WON T EVEN CONSIDER USING THE SYSTEM DUE TO DIFFICULTY AND FEAR OF SCREWING SOMETHING UP T 
ERGONOMY ON SEATS
ES PRIMARILY AIMED AT LUXURY AND COMFORT 
ESC KICKS IN EARLY
ESPECIALLY LIKE LINKING COMMUNICATION TO IPHONE FOR HANDS FREE TALK 
ESPECIALLY LIKE REAR VIEW CAMERA WITH LINES THAT BEND WHEN BACKING INTO PARKING SPACE 
ESPECIALLY ON COUNTRY ROADS I DON T FEEL LIKE THE LIGHTS REACH FAR ENOUGH OUT IT DOESN T MAKE ME FEEL SAFE THE DISTANCE IS SHORTER THAN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED 
EV
EVEN A 2 YEAR OLD CAN PUSH THE BUTTON TO DROP DOWN THE DVD PLAYER 
EVEN AT 6 2 VISIBILITY IN THE FRONT IS LIMITED BY SQUARED OFF FRONT HOOD AND FENDERS 
EVEN MY 2009 HAD SMALL AUXILIARY SIDE MIRRORS T0 SEE THE BLIND SPOT INEXCUSABLE TO OMIT SUCH A LOW COST AND IMPORTANT ITEM ON A 2015 VEHICLE ESPECIALLY ON ONE OF THIS PRICE VERY DISAPPOINTING 
EVEN MY WIFE HAS INDICATED SHE HAS NO BLIND SPOTS IN OUR MINI
EVEN THE ALTIMA HAS LANE CHANGE WARNINGS THEY CHEAPED OUT ON THIS CAR
EVEN THE HIGHEST UPGRADE BURMESTER AUDIOPHILE SYSTEM DOESN T TRULY PLAY HIGH RESOLUTION AUDIO MAX RESOLUTION IS ONLY 24B/48KHZ SAMPKING AND THERE ARE SEVERE RESTRICTIONS ON THE FILE FORMATS SUPPORTED NO SUPPORT FOR ALAC OR FLAC UNACCEPTABLE 
EVEN THOUGH I AM 6 4 I AM ABLE TO SEE OUT OF THE VEHICLE VERY WELL MANY CARS DO NOT PROVIDE ME WITH ENOUGH VISIBILITY EVEN THOUGH I FIT IN THE SEAT FINE 
EVEN THOUGH I AM LOWER TO THE GROUND THAN A LOT OF CARS I FEEL COMPLETELY SAFE 
EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A BACK UP CAMARA IT S HARD TOO SEE OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER WHEN REVERSING 
EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BOSE THE QUALITY OF SOUND ISN T WHAT I EXPECTED 
EVEN THOUGH I HAVEN T NEEDED TO USE THE NAVIGATION AND POINTS OF INTEREST YET I AM GLAD TO HAVE IT WHEN I GO ON A TRIP 
EVEN THOUGH I VE HAD THE CAR FOR THREE MONTHS THERE IS MUCH I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE MOSTLY BECAUSE I VE NOT TAKEN THE TIME TO LEARN NOR HAVE I ASKED OTHERS FOR HELP MORE TRAINING WOULD HAVE BEEN APPRECIATED 
EVEN THOUGH I VE ONLY LOOKED THROUGH IT THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T APPEAR TOO USER FRIENDLY 
EVEN THOUGH I WENT THROUGH THE VOICE MATCH TUTORIAL WHEN I PURCHASED MY AUDI THERE IS STILL DIFFICULTY IN THE SYSTEM RECOGNIZING MY VOICE CAN BE FRUSTRATING AT TIMES 
EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A BACK UP CAMERA I STILL TURN AROUND AND LOOK BEFORE BACKING UP IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE EVERYTHING WHEN DOING THAT I LOVE THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE AND FEEL VERY CONFIDENT AND SAFE WHEN GOING AROUND CORNERS ESPECIALLY 
EVEN THOUGH IT HAS LANE DEPARTURE WARNING A LARGER MIRROR WOULD BE NICE 
EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN IMPROVEMENT IN VISIBILITY WITH THE BACK WINDOW FROM THE 2013 TO THE 2015 CAN STILL BE DIFFICULT TO SEE IN BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING OUT NO BACK UP CAMERA IF THE BACK WINDOW COULD BE WIDENED IF COULD IMPROVE VISIBILITY 
EVEN THOUGH IT IS SMALLER THAN OTHER VEHICLES I VE DRIVEN PREVIOUSLY I FEEL EXCEPTIONALLY SAFE
EVEN THOUGH IT IS TRUCK IT ACCELLERATES AND MANUVERS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL FUN TO DRIVE 
EVEN THOUGH MY CAR HAS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING I STILL RELY ON THE MIRRORS A SMALL CONVEX MIRROR ON THE MAIN OUTSIDE LEFT MIRROR WOULD HELP 
EVEN THOUGH MY PHONE IS CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH THE CAR DOESN T ALWAYS SEEM TO PICK IT UP AND I HAVE TO HARD WIRE INSTEAD THE MAP IS A LITTLE BUSY TO LOOK AT WHILE DRIVING THERE ISN T A WAY TO SEARCH BY A LOCATION NAME THAT I VE FOUND IN THE N 
EVEN THOUGH MY RAV IS ONLY A 4 CYL IT HAS PLENTY OF PEP AND GREAT HANDLING TO MAKE IT SAFE TO DRIVE AND TO STEER CLEAR OF ROAD HAZARDS 
EVEN THOUGH SIDE MIRRORS ARE SIZEABLE THERE STILL IS A BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE 
EVEN THOUGH THE BACK WINDOW IS ABSOLUTELY TINY I AM IMPRESSED WITH HOW WELL I CAN SEE OUT OF IT IT S NOT THE BEST BUT CONSIDERING IT S SIZE WELL DONE 
EVEN THOUGH THE REAR VIEW IS NARROW I WOULDN T CHANGE IT IF IT WOULD CHANGE THE OVERALL SLICK LOOK OF THE VEHICLE 
EVEN THOUGH THE SPEAKERS ARE THE STANDARD ONES THEY DO NOT GET LOUD AT ALL JUST TO BE ABLE TO HEAR IT CLEARLY I HAVE TO HAVE IT OVER 30 OUT OF 440 THE BASE IS VERY POOR AS WELL AND WITH NO NEED FOR NAVIGATION $2000 IS WAY TO MUCH FOR SPEAKER 
EVEN THOUGH THE VAN IS A LARGER VEHICLE THERE ARE FEWER BLIND SPOTS THAN MANY OF TODAYS SEDANS 
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A PERFORMANCE VEHICLE THE BASE AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD BE OF HIGHER QUALITY SUCH AS THE BOSE SYSTEM ON OTHER 911 S 
EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE HAD SUBURBANS 5 BEFORE I FELT THAT WE DID NOT GET ENOUGH TRAINING ON THIS NEW CAR THERE ARE SO MANY NEW FEATURES THAT I DOUBT AT OUR AGE IF WE EVER LEARN REVERYTHING 
EVEN WE IT THE WARNING SYSTEM WIDER ANGLE MIRRORS WOULD BE NICE 
EVEN WHEN DRIVER SEAT IS ADJUSTED TO AS HIGH AS I FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING THE HOOD STILL SEEMS TO OBSCURE VISION AS IT SEEMS HIGH AND THE FRONT SIDE PANELS OBSCURE SIDE VISION BUT I KNOW THEY MUST BE THAT SIZE FOR THE AIRBAGS 
EVEN WHEN TURNED UP TO THE MAXIMUM ILLUMINATION THE DASH AND RADIO CONTROL ARE DIFFICULT TO SEE ON A BRIGHT DAY THEY ARE RED PERHAPS A BLUE OR GREEN WOULD BE EASIER TO SEE IN THE BRIGHT DAYLIGHT 
EVEN WITH 2 SESSIONS WITH DEALER I NEED HELP FROM MY CHILDREN TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM I AM 73 AND ELECTRONICS ARE NOT MY THING NO FAULT OF THE CAR 
EVEN WITH BACK UP CAMERA BACKING STILL FEELS DIFFICULT
EVEN WITH BLIND SPOT ASSIST I FEEL UNSURE OF THE AREAS TO THE SIDES AND REAR OF THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF SEEING CLEARLY 
EVEN WITH BLIND SPOT ASSISTANCE I STILL PREFER TO CHECK FOR MYSELF BEFORE CHANGING LANES SOMETIMES THE SECOND ROW HEADREST IS IN MY FIELD OF VISION 
EVEN WITH SEAT HEIGHT ADJUSTED I HAVE A HARD TIME FEELING LIKE THE VISORS COME DOWN FAR ENOUGH 
EVEN WITH THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR LIGHTS I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE SMALL BLIND SPOT MIRROR IN THE CORNER OF THE SIDE MIRRORS 
EVEN WITH THE BOSE SPEAKER SYSTEM THE SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO BE THE BEST QUALITY AND IT SEEMS IT HAS TO BE TURNED UP PRETTY HIGH TO GET IT LOUD FOR THE KIDS IN THE BACK TO HEAR WELL 
EVEN WITH THE CONVEXT MIRRORS BLIND SIDE IS NOT COVERED WELL 
EVEN WITH THE HARMON K SPEAKERS IN THE CAR THE AUDIO SEEMS A BIT WASHED OUT AND THE BASS THAT I GREW TO EXPECT WITH BOSE IN PREVIOUS VEHICLES JUST IS NO MORE I LOVE THE CAR BUT WOULD REALLY LOVE IT IF BMW WOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON GETTING THE SOUNDS 
EVEN WITH THE OPTIONAL H K SYSTEM THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OOMPH AT SPEED 
EVEN WITH THE REAR CAMERA THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS I LOVE THE CAR 
EVEN WITH THE SIDE MIRRORS HAVING THE ADDITIONAL LITTLE MIRROR I FIND IT HARD TO SEE CARS WHEN CHANGING LANES 
EVEN WITH THE SPOILER ON THE BACK IT SEEMS AS IF THEY TOOK GREAT CARE IN MAKING SURE YOU WHERE ABLE TO HAVE A GREAT RANGE OF VIEW THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLE
EVEN WITH THE TOP TRIM FOR THE 2015 TOYOTA PRIUS C THERE IS NO OPTION FOR AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS WITH A NEW TOP TRIM VEHICLE THIS SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE 
EVEN WITHOUT NAVIGATION VOICE ACTIVATION SHOULD BE AN OPTION 
EVERY ANGLE OF VIEW IS REPRESENTED CLEARLY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT BLIND SPOTS ARE EXTREMELY SMALL 
EVERY CAR HAS BLIND SPOTS SAME HERE
EVERY CAR SHOULD HAVE AN AUTOMATIC WARNING SYSTEM WHEN CHANGING LANES 
EVERY DETAIL
EVERY DRIVER SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AUDI PROVIDED OLD SCHOOL R&B YES I AM SERIOUS!
EVERY IS FAIRLY EASY TO FOLLOW EVERYTHING SEEMS TO WORK AS IT SHOULD 
EVERY LEXUS I HAVE EVER OWNED HAS TERRIBLE WINDSHIELD WIPERS THEY STREAK
EVERY NOW AND THEN THE CAR INDICATES THE WASHER FLUID IS LOW WHICH I DON T THINK IT IS BC ITS A BRAND NEW CAR WHICH I DIDN T EVEN USE THE WIPER FLUID I ASSUMED SINCE IT WAS VERY COLD IT WAS JUST A MINOR GLITCH 
EVERY OPTION IS EASY TO USE
EVERY POST/PILLAR IS HUGE VISIBILITY IS HORRIBLE!
EVERY QUESTION NEEDS THE OPTION OF CHECKING DO NOT USE IF WE DO NOT USE THE SYSTEM WE DO NOT NOT HOW GOOD IT IS 
EVERY THING IS GOOD WITH THE CAR
EVERY THING IS GREAT THATS WHY I BUY FORDS
EVERY TIGUAN SHOULD HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUILT IN 
EVERY TIME I GET A NEW F150 WITH THE SONY AUDIO THE QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SEEMS TO TAKE A STEP BACKWARD IN THIS CASE THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH BASS COMING FROM THE SPEAKERS WHILE VERY LITTLE SEEMS TO COME FROM THE SUB OTHER THAN THAT TOP NOTCH 
EVERY TIME I USE THE BLUETOOTH TO MAKE A PHONE CALL I FEEL I HAVE TO YELL IN ORDER TO GET THE PERSON ON THE LINE TO HEAR 
EVERY TIME THE CAR IS STARTED THE STARLINK MULTIMEDAIA DISPLAYS FOR 5 SECOND A CAUTION AGREEMENT I WOULD TO HAVE THE FEATURE TURNED OFF 
EVERY TIME YOU CONNECT YOUR PHONE WITH USB IT DEFAULTS TO START PLAYING MEDIA ON THE DEVICE I JUST WANT TO CHARGE THE PHONE I DONT WANT TO PLAY MY TABATA SONGS FROM MY BOOTCAMP CLASS LET ME CHOOSE ON THE SCREEN IF I WANT TO PLAY SONGS
EVERYONE I CALL SAY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR ME I HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM IN MY LAST PASSAT I LIKED THE DISPLAY OF THE RADIO WITH MY 2012 PASSAT THE ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLE WAS MUCH BETTER IN THAT VEHICLE I DID NOT NEED THE NAVIGATION BUT 
EVERYONE IN MY FAMILY IS CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH AND IT IS EASY FOR ALL TO USE
EVERYONE LIKES THE MUSIC FROM THE VEHICLE 
EVERYONE SAYS ITS LIKE I AM TALKING ON A LAND LINE 
EVERYT WORKS TOGETHER FLAWLESSLY
EVERYTHING
EVERYTHING 
EVERYTHING A DRIVER NEEDS IS RIGHT ON THAT MAIN SCREEN THE SCREEN ISN T CLUTTERED OR FULL OF FILLER 
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM IN THE CAR COULD BE BETTER 
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CAR IS TO MY LIKING 
EVERYTHING AUDIO WISE WORKS GREAT IN THE OUTLANDER 
EVERYTHING CAN BE CONTROL BY VOICE COMMAND SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL OR YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD 
EVERYTHING CONNECTED THROUGH THE PHONE TO THE CAR AND BEING ABLE TO USE VOICE COMMANDS TO USE IT 
EVERYTHING EXCEPT VOICE RECOGNITION WORKS
EVERYTHING FOR IT TO BE A 2015 IT S NOT EQUIPPED WITH A LOT OF NEW THINGS THAT THE CAR SHOULD HAVE
EVERYTHING FUNCTIONS WELL HOWEVER STILL LEARNING BEST WAY TO USE THE NAVIGATION FEATURES
EVERYTHING GOOD NO COMPLAINTS
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN CLEAR AND PRECISE I VE ENJOYED ALL ASPECTS THE AUDIO IS ON POINT JUST WHAT I WANTED FIRST VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED THAT I HAVE ENJOYED STOCK AUDIO AND THAT I DON T WANT TO REPLACE PHONE LINK WEATHER CABLE OR BLUE TOOTH HA 
EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WONDERFUL AND EASY TO USE!
EVERYTHING IN THE LEFT COLUMN
EVERYTHING IS ACCESSIBILE FROM STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
EVERYTHING IS APPEALING TO ME 
EVERYTHING IS AS EXPECTED

EXCESSIVE CLOUDINESS CREATED FROM WIPERS IN SNOWY CONDITIONS MAKES ME FEEL UNSAFE 
EXCESSIVE CUES FROM COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS
EXCESSIVE ICE/SNOW BUILD UP ALONG THE OUTER EDGE OF WINDSHIELD FROM THE WIPERS PUSHING IT WOULD SUGGEST SOME SORT OF HEATING DEVICE ALONG THE EDGE AND BOTTOM WHERE THE WIPERS REST 
EXCESSIVE ROAD NOISE
EXCESSIVELY ENGINEERED TOO COMPLICATED 
EXECESIVE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE FRONT ROOF FRAME AND THE DOOR POSTS THEY ARE TOO WIDE AND DO CAUE A BLIND SPOT FOR THE DRIVER

EXHAUST SOUND AND DESIGN
EXHAUST SOUNDS GREAT
EXISTING STREETS ARE NOT ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM
EXIT INFORMATION WHEN TRAVELING ON INTERSTATE HIGHWAYS
EXITING AN INTERSTATE ON AN EXIT RAMP ON TO A SURFACE ROAD THAT IS ON AN ANGLE IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE ONCOMING CARS DUE TO THE EXTREMELY LARGE ROOF POST BETWEEN THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW AND REAR SIDE WINDOW

EXTEND VISORS LENGTH
EXTENDABLE SUN VISORS WOULD BE REALLY NICE!
EXTENDED VISORS ARE A POOR IDEA THEY BLOCK MIRROR 
EXTENDER PANELS AND SIDE FLAPS ON DRIVER AND PASSENGERS SUN VISORS
EXTENSIVE BLIND SPOTS ON DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE OF VEHICLE DUE TO VERTICAL COLUMNS BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR DOORS MAY BE DUE TO SIDE COLLISION AIR BAGS???? HAVING THE BLIND SPOT WARNING DOES HELP WITH THIS ISSUE BUT NOT WHEN LOOKING FOR ONC

EXTERIOR MIRRORS TO SMALL
EXTERIOR MIRRORS WITH BLIND SPOT WARNING NOT GOOD ENOUGH DUE SMALL BSW

FINDING POI S IS HORRIBLE AND RARELY HELPS ME FIND WHAT I M LOOKING FOR IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ENOUGH POI S THAT I CAN FIND IN MY BMW THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC IS ALSO NOT NEARLY EXPANSIVE OR ACCURATE ENOUGH IT S ALSO HARD TO READ THE SCREEN WHEN I 
FINDING POINTS OF INTEREST AND OTHER DESTINATIONS WITHOUT GIVING THE ADDRESS IS DIFFICULT 
FINDING POINTS OF INTEREST THAT ARE NEAR THE CURRENT LOCATION DEFAULT IS TO FIND ALL IN THE REGION EVEN IF A FEW STATES AWAY 
FINDING THE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF THE SYSTEM SOME STUFF IS HARD TO FIND QUICKLY 
FINDING THE WINDOW AND LOCK CONTROLS AT NIGHT IS DIFFICULT THEY SHOULD BE LIGHTED JUST AS THOSE ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE

FIRST AND FOREMOST BMW NEEDS TO INCLUDE TECH PACKAGES IN THE PRICE AND NOT MAKE IT AN ADD ON I HAD MORE TECH IN MY FORD FOCUS FOR LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE OF THIS BMW WHEN USING HANDS FREE THE AUDIO NEEDS TO BE LOUDER AND MORE CLEAR OVERALL

FM HD SHOULD BE STANDARD
FM HD SIGNAL NEEDS IMPROVING HD RADIO DOESN T WORK HALF OF THE TIME I WAS EXPECTING MORE OUT OF THE AUDIO SPEAKERS TOGGLE BUTTON NEAR THE ARM REST IS IN A BAD LOCATION I ACCIDENTALLY SWITCH SONGS BY BUMPING IT WITH MY ELBOW 
FM IS ALL I NEED 
FM RADIO CLEAR
FM RADIO RECEPTION
FM RADIO RECEPTION IS MARGINAL AS TO RANGE
FM RADIO SOUND QUALITY 
FM SOUND QUALITY IS WORSE THAN 2004 VW PASSAT I HAVEN T YET USED THE CD PLAYER 
FM STATION LOCKING OFTENTIMES THE RADIO DROPS THE STATION ON WHICH IT IS TYPICALLY SET FORCING A REDO 
FM STATIONS ARE WEAK
FOG LAMPS ARE A NICE ADDITION TO THE FORWARD VISIBILITY 
FOG LIGHTS ARE FOR CRAP! MIGHT AS WELL BE CHEAP PROBABLY NOT CHEAP ENOUGH JEWELRY!! THEY ILLUMINATE NOTHING BUT THE GROUND 5FT IN FRONT OF THE CAR ONLY SOLUTION? DRIVE REALLY SLOW WHEN IT S FOGGY OUT 
FOG LIGHTS ARE NOT AS EFFECTED AS I HAD WANTED
FOG LIGHTS ARE POORLY LIT
FOG LIGHTS ARE USELESS AUTODIMMING MIRROR DOES NOT GET DARK ENOUGH
FOG LIGHTS ARE VERY STRANGE TURNING OFF/ON BASED UPON LIGHTING DRIVES YOU CRAZY
FOG LIGHTS COME ON WHEN TURNING AT NIGHT IS VERY HELPFUL 
FOG LIGHTS FOG LIGHTS FOG LIGHTS THEY ARE GREAT IN FOG RAIN AND SNOWY WEATHER CONDITIONS I WAS A FOUR TIME SUBARU OWNER AND ALWAYS HAD FOG LIGHTS I TRULY MISS THEM 
FOG LIGHTS INEFFECTIVE
FOG LIGHTS NEED AN UPGRADE BIGGER AND MORE VISIBILITY 
FOG LIGHTS SEEM DIM AND IT USEFUL 
FOG LIGHTS SHOULD BE LED TO MATCH HEADLIGHT COLOR
FOG LIGHTS SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT DON T HAVE THEM BUT PLAN TO GET INSTALLED
FOGGED WINDOWS ARE NOT SAFE
FOGGING ICE BUILDUP ON EXTERIOR BOTTOM OF WINDSHIELD
FOGGING UP WINDOWS
FOGLIGHTS
FOGLIGHTS SHOULD BE BRIGHTER 
FOLD DOWN BACK SEAT FOR STORAGE
FOLD DOWN CARGO SPACE NOT LEVEL
FOLD DOWN SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE OUTSTANDING AND HELPFUL WHEN BACKING UP SO IS THE CAMERA SYSTEM IN ALL ASPECTS OF DRIVING
FOLDING REAR HEADRESTS ARE A GREAT FEATURE TO ENHANCE REARWARD VISABILITY
FOLDING SIDE MIRRORS
FOLKS ON THE OTHER END OF PHONE CALLS SAY THAT IT S HARD TO HEAR ME THROUGH THE BLUE TOOTH 
FOOT PEDAL FOR GAS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE PLACED WELL FOR ME TO USE COMFORTABLE
FOR A 150 000 CAR THE AUDIO QUALITY IS TERRIBLE 
FOR A 2015 THE SOFTWARE THAT COMES WITH THE INFO SYSTEM LAGS IN AGES
FOR A 2015 VEHICLE IT IS A BIT BEHIND THE TIMES WHEN IT COMES TO IN CAR ENTERTAINMENT TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEMS IT S A BIT OUT DATED LOOKING MENU IS DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING IT IS REALLY TOUGH TO USE IT REALLY TAKES MY EYES OF 
FOR A 2015 VEHICLE NOT TO HAVE AUTOMATED WINDSCREEN WIPERS NOR AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS IS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND I HAVE DRIVEN CHEAPER VEHICLES WHICH HAD THESE FUNCTIONALITIES
FOR A BANG AND OLUFSEN SOUND SYSTEM DID NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS 
FOR A BASE MODEL AN EXCEPTIONAL AUDIO SYSTEM 
FOR A BASIC PACKAGE IT S BETTER THAN MANY HIGH DOLLAR PACKAGES I VE PAID FOR 
FOR A BASIC SYSTEM IT SOUNDS FANTASTIC!
FOR A CAR IN THIS PRICE RANGE IT SHOULD COME WITH A REAR CAMERA I DON T HAVE THE NAVIGATION PACKAGE 
FOR A CAR THIS SIZE IT FEELS REALLY SAFE GENERALLY I LIKE BIGGER CARS SUCH AS MY PILOT BUT FOR A SMALL CAR THIS FEELS PRETTY SAFE 
FOR A LARGE SUV MY VISIBILITY IS NEVER AN ISSUE 
FOR A LEXUS THE SUN VISORS ARE VERY POOR QUALITY ESPECIALLY WHEN USED ON THE SIDE THE SLIDE OUT PANEL IS WORTHLESS 
FOR A LUXURY CAR IT DOES NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOMETHING I THINK ALL TRUE LUXURY CARS SHOULD HAVE TO TOP IT OFF ONE CAN NOT BE ADDED I THINK THAT WAS A POOR DESIGN FOR A LUXURY CAR
FOR A NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEWLY INTRODUCED IN 2014 ONE OF THE MOST MOST POORLY DESIGNED DATE SYSTEMS I HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN A LUXURY AUTOMOBILE
FOR A ROADSTER THE VISIBILITY IS QUITE GOOD 
FOR A SENIOR I AM FINDING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THAN MY PREVIOUS CADILLAC AND BUICK IT S PROBABLY DUE TO MY HAVING ONLY AROUND 1200 MILES ON THE VEHICLE I JUST HAVE NOT DRIVEN IT ON A LONG TRIP YET WHERE I CAN EXPERIENCE THE ENHANCED 
FOR A SHORT PERSON IT IS HARD TO SEE THE FRONT END OF THE VEHICLE AND NOT SURE WHEN TO TURN WHEN BACKING OUT OF A CARPORT OR PARKING SPOT AND ALSO KNOW WHEN TO STOP WHEN PARKING
FOR A SHORT PERSON WHICH HAS THE SEAT FORWARD WHILE DRIVING THE SECOND ROW HEADREST IS IN THE WAY FOR SEEING OUT IF BACKING UP I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM IN THE MOUNTAINEER I HAD 
FOR A SHORTER PERSON THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS CREATE A BLIND SPOT WHEN YOU PULL UP TO A 4 WAY INTERSECTION CAN T SEE THE CAR STOPPED AT THE LEFT STOP SIGN DUE TO DRIVER SIDE MIRROR 
FOR A SMALL CAR FEELS MUCH BIGGER AND HIGHER UP WHICH PROVIDES GREATER FORWARD VISIBILITY 
FOR A SMALL CAR LIKE THIS IT FEELS PRETTY SAFE 
FOR A VEHICLE IN 2015 TO NOT HAVE HID HEADLIGHTS I THINK IS A SHAME 
FOR A VEHICLE OF THIS SIZE THE OVERALL VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT AND COUPLED WITH THE OPTIONAL BLIND SPOT DETECTION THE ABILITY TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE SAFELY AND MANEUVER THE VEHICLE BETWEEN LANES IS EXCELLENT 
FOR ALL QUESTIONS IN THIS SURVEY WE HAVE HIGH RATINGS BUT SINCE WE HAVE ONLY HAD THIS NEW VEHICLE SINCE NOV 30 2014 IT IS HARD TO TRULY EVALUATE FAIRLY I THINK THIS SURVEY SHOULD BE TAKEN AFTER AT LEAST ONE YEAR OR USE 
FOR AS SMALL AND SPORTY AS THIS CAR IS IT HAS GREAT VISIBILITY AND DOES NOT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE DRIVING A CAR THAT IS AS SMALL AS IT IS 
FOR BEING THE STANDARD AUDIO/INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM IT IS FAR FROM STANDARD PLENTY OF WHAT FEELS LIKE UPGRADED FEATURES AND FANTASTIC SOUND 
FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY TAKE ME TO TARGET IN OTSEGO FOR NAVIGATION BUT THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW THAT YOU HAVE TO TYPE IN THE ADDRESS WHO WANTS TO TYPE IN ADDRESSES?? I END UP JUST USING MY PHONE FOR NAVIGATION 
FOR FUTURE MODELS FOCUS ON BLIND SPOTS AND LESS ON REAR VISIBILITY CONTROL MAYBE CONSIDER A LAN SWITCH CAMERA THAT MONITORS THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF YOUR VEHICLE DURING A LANE CHANGE 
FOR GPS PROVIDE A UNIFORM MOUNTING LOCATION WHICH COULD BE EASILY ADAPTED TO THE VARIOUS GPS SYSTEMS THAT THE VEHICLE OWNERS ULTIMATELY END UP USING 
FOR IT TO WORK ALL THE TIME
FOR ME IT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND IS NOT DISTRACTING WHEN DRIVING BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS DONE BY VOICE COMMAND 
FOR ME IT S ALL ABOUT NOT HAVING TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD WHEN I RECEIVE PHONE CALLS AND HAVING THE SYSTEM CALL THE NUMBER FOR ME I DO NOT ALLOW TEXTING IN MY CAR FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT 
FOR ME IT S EASIER TO USE MY PHONE FOR NAV BUT I LOVE THE SYSTEM IN THE TRUCK IT HAS A LOT OF FEATURES AND SOUNDS GREAT IT S LIKE A SYSTEM I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IN A LUXURY CAR
FOR ME IT WORKS AND THAT S WHAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO DO
FOR ME IT WOULD BE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND DIRECTIONS THEIR TOO CONFUSING FOR TECHNOLOGY IMPAIRED PEOPLE 
FOR ME ITS OK JUST THE WAY IT IS
FOR ME THE ONE ASPECT THAT COULD BE IMPROVED THE MOST IS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS AS THEY HAVE A STATIC SOUND 
FOR ME VISOR IS NOT LONG ENOUGH TO BLOCK SUNLIGHT
FOR MY HEIGHT AND SIZE THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS CONCERNING OTHER VEHICLES COMING FROM THE SIDE 
FOR MY HEIGHT AND WHERE I NEED TO POSITION THE STEERING WHEEL FOR COMFORT I CAN T SEE THE TURN SIGNAL INDICATORS OR THE SPEED ON THE DIAL AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS I USE THE SPEED DIGITIAL DISPLAY TO MAINTAIN SPEED AND DUCK DOWN TO SEE IF I VE LEFT MY 
FOR MY HEIGHT I THINK THE LOCATION AND STYLE OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE SOMETIMES OBSTRUCTS MY VIEW WHEN TRYING TO IDENTIFY A CURB OR OTHER CLOSE OBJECT WHEN PARKED
FOR MY WIFE IT IS TOO BIG
FOR NO APPARENT REASON OUR WASHER DOES NOT WORK
FOR NORMAL DRIVING I WOULD LIKE THE LIGHTS TO LIGHT A BIGGER AREA WITHOUT USING BRIGHTS 
FOR OUTSIDE VISIBILITY ESSENTIAL TO HAVE MIRRORS SET CORRECTLY MY MEMORY SEATING SETTING SEEMS TO HAVE TOO MUCH FLEXIBILITY IN SETTING OF PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR 
FOR PARKING CAN T SEE FRONT NOSE OF CAR WOULD LIKE A FRONT PARKING CAMERA 
FOR PEOPLE USING THE BUILT IN WIFI HAVE MORE BUILT IN CAPABILITIES SUCH AS GETTING WEATHER TRAFFIC VIA WIFI RATHER THAN THRU SIRIUS XM INTEGRATE WITH MORE MUSIC STREAMING APPS ONLY SUPPORTS PANDORA 
FOR REGULAR RADIO IT IS SUPERB BUT I WISH I COULD HAVE GOTTEN SIRIUS RADIO INSTALLED BY FIAT IT WASN T AN OPTION I WOULD HAVE GLADLY PAID TO HAVE IT INSTALLED 
FOR SAFETY PURPOSES THE CAR SHOULD HAVE SIDE AND FRONT SENSORS WHEN THE CAR IS TO CLOSE TO OTHER VEHICLES OR OBJECTS
FOR SAFETY REASONS TOO MUCH OF THE SYSTEM IS LOCKED DOWN YOU HAVE TO BE PARKED IN ORDER TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM EVEN WITH A PASSENGER IN THE CAR UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY SAVED THE ADDRESS IN YOUR CONTACTS THIS IS VERY INCONVENIENT SIMILA 
FOR SHORTER PEOPLE A SECOND DROP DOWN VISOR WOULD BE HELPFUL
FOR SOME REASON I HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING MY VEHICLE TO CONNECT TO AND STAY CONNECTED TO PANDORA ALSO I HAVE PROBLEMS CONNECTING MY IPOD ACCESSING FEATURES ON MY SMARTPHONE AND PLAYING EXTERNAL MEDIA SOURCES 
FOR SOME REASON IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO SEE IF THERE IS A CAR IMMEDIATELY NEXT TO MY PASSENGER REAR DOOR ESPECIALLY IF IT IS A CAR THAT IS SHORTER THAN MINE I JUST THINK THE TRUCK SHOULD COME EQUIP WITH ONE OF THOSE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON B 
FOR SOME REASON THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC DOESN T SEEM TO BE UP TO DATE AND SOMETIMES I ALMOST WONDER IF THE TRAFFIC NOTIFICATION ON THE MAP RED OR YELLOW TRAFFIC IS ACTUALLY LIT UP ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I AM DRIVING SO 
FOR SOME REASON THE SYSTEM DOES NOT READ THE MOST RECENT TEXT MESSAGE THAT HAS ARRIVED INSTEAD THE SYSTEM READS THE PREVIOUS MESSAGE ?????
FOR SOME REASON THE TELEPHONE BUTTONS WERE EASIER TO SEE AND CHOOSE IN MY PREVIOUS ACURA 2012 
FOR SOME REASON THE UCONNECT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK WITH IPHONES OTHER THAN TO PLACE CALL I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEND TEXTS HANDSFREE THROUGH THE UCONNECT SYSTEM 
FOR SOME REASON THERE IS A WIND SCREEN BETWEEN THE REAR TWO SEATS THAT CAN T BE LOWERED ENOUGH TO PROVIDE A FULL VIEW OUT THE REAR WINDOW 
FOR SOME REASON WHEN THE TOP IS DOWN AND WIND HITS THE MICROPHONE YOU CAN HEAR STATIC THROUGH THE SOUND SYSTEM EVEN WHEN YOU RE NOT ON THE PHONE IT REALLY DOESN T MAKE SENSE 
FOR SOME STRANGE REASON THE PATHFINDER DOES NOT HAVE A LANE WARNING FEATURE LIKE MY OLD MURANO THIS IS AN IDEAL SAFETY FEATURE WHICH CAN WARN THE DRIVER WHEN HE IS GETTING DISTRACTED BY ALL THE ELECTRONIC DEVICES 
FOR SOMEONE NEW TO ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY IN A VEHICLE IT IS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING AND CONFUSING 
FOR SPENDING SO MUCH YOU WOULD THINK BETTER SPEAKERS AND A BIGGER SCREEN AGAIN FOR $27 000 FROM ANYONE ELSE AND EVERYTHING IS TOUCH SCREEN AND HEATED 
FOR THE $47000 I PAID THE FOG LIGHTS WHICH ARE A GREAT HELP SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS WE AGE WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET TO MAINTAIN SAFE DRIVING 
FOR THE ADDITIONAL COST I WAS EXPECTING MORE FROM THE HARMON KARDON PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM IT SEEMS ONLY SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE STANDARD SYSTEM THAT IS OFFERED AT NO EXTRA COST 
FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I PAID $42 000 THIS VEHICLE SHOULD COME WITH XM RADIO AND THE DISPLAY IS VERY BASIC THE SPEAKERS ARE BASIC AS WELL SHOULD COME WITH AT LEAST BOSE
FOR THE BLUE TOOTH FEATURE YOU HAVE TO MAX OUT SPEAKERS TO GET DECENT SOUND 
FOR THE COMPLEXITY OF INFOTAINMENT THE SYSTEM IS PRETTY EASY TO USE HONORARY MENTION GOOGLE MAPS IS A NICE TOUCH 
FOR THE COMPONENTS WE USE IT WORKS FINE 
FOR THE COST OF THE NEW VEHICLES THE SYSTEMS SUBSCRIPTIONS SHOULD LAST LONGER SIRIUS RADIO COMPANY ARE ABSOLUTY OFFENSIVE IN THE ATTEMPTS TO RESIGN CUSTOMERS THE MAIL AND PHONE CALLS ARE VERY UNAPPRECIATED I WILL NOT PURCHASE FOR THIS REASON 
FOR THE COST OF THE VEHICLE THERE SHOULD BE THE WARNING LIGHTS ON THE SIDE MIRRORS FOR PASSING CARS
FOR THE GAS INFORMATION SYSTEM IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF IT IMMEDIATELY DISPLAYED THE PRICE OF PREMIUM GAS NOT JUST THE LOWEST GRADE 
FOR THE MOST PART EVERYTHING IS GOOD 
FOR THE MOST PART IT IS SIMPLE THE CLOCK IS HARD TO FIND TO CHANGE TIME TO DAYLIGHT SAVINGS BUT OTHERWISE IT S VERY EASY TO USE 
FOR THE NAV SYSTEM IT S NOT INTUITIVE HOW TO GO BACK IF YOU ENTER AN ADDRESS WRONG 
FOR THE PK THAT I LEASED NEED TO COME WITH LED HEADLIGHTS
FOR THE PRICE I PAID IT SHOULD HAVE CAME WITH AT LEAST A USB PORT 
FOR THE PRICE I PAY I WOULD HAVE SELECTED A BETTER CAR I BLAME THE SALES AT THE DEALER I PURCHASED A CAR COLOR I DINT LIKE BECOUSE EVERY TIME I SAID I DONT LIKE THAT COLOR HE WILL SAY THE BLACK DONT COME WITH THAT I THOUGH IT HAD AUTO PARKING SEN 
FOR THE PRICE IT SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS OR WARNING SYSTEM FOR APPROACHING VEHICLES NOT FEATURED WELL FOR THE PRICE I PAID IF I COULD I WOULD TAKE IT BACK FOR A CHEVY TRAVERSE WHICH OFFERS MORE ROOM AND MORE FEATURES FOR THE SAME MONEY 
FOR THE PRICE OF CAR THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS NOT VERY NICE I HAD A NISSAN SENTRA THAT HAD NAVIGATION SYSTEM BLUE TOOTH AND SEROUS RADIO A LOT LESS MONEY THE CAR IS A GREAT RUNNING CAR IM JUST VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE AUDIO SYTEM WHEN YOU PAY ALMOST 
FOR THE PRICE OF THE CAR THE SAFETY FEATURES LIKE BLIND SPOT ASSIST SHOULD COME DEFAULT EVEN CIVIC COMES WITH THESE FEATURES LITTLE DISAPPOINTED NOT TO SEE THIS FEATURE WHICH IS NOWADAYS ON ALL LUXARY CARS 
FOR THE PRICE OF THIS VEHICLE AND THE ERA IN WHICH WE LIVE ONSTAR SHOULD NOT BE THE NAV SOURCE IT SHOULD BE A BASIC PART OF ANY TOUCHSCREEN MULTIMEDIA VEHICLE SYSTEM 
FOR THE PRICE OF THIS VEHICLE IT SHOULD HAVE A REAR CAMERA 
FOR THE PRICE OF THIS VEHICLE THERE SHOULD BE BOTH A FRONT AND SIDE SUN VISOR FOR THE DRIVER 
FOR THE PRICE PAID THE BASE STEREO IS RATHER LOW QUALITY THE FIAT 500 HAS A BETTER SOUNDING SYSTEM IN A $15 000 CAR 
FOR THE PRICE POINT OF THIS CAR I FEEL THE AUDIO QUALITY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM IS MUCH LOWER THAN OTHER CAR S AT A SIMILAR PRICE POINT VERY DISAPPOINTING 
FOR THE PRICE WOULD LIKE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR 
FOR THE QUALITY ASPECT THIS VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE A BOSE SOUND SYSTEM INSTALLED IN IT 
FOR THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE THE HEADLIGHTS AT NIGHT DO NOT PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL COVERAGE OF THE ROAD AHEAD OTHER SMALLER VEHICLES HAVE BETTER HEADLIGHT SYSTEMS 
FOR THE SYSTEM TO PICK UP THE LAST SONG PLAYED ON AN IPOD I DON T EVEN BOTHER TO PLAY MY IPOD IN THE CX 5 BECAUSE IT S SUCH A LOUSY EXPERIENCE NO EXCUSE FOR MAZDA ON THIS ISSUE 
FOR THE TYPE OF VEHICLE IT IS VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT 
FOR THE VAVIGATION THE ON SCREEN INFORMATION ABOUT POINTS OF INTEREST FOR THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM THE EASE OF OPERATION FOR AUDIO SYSTEM THE USE OF MANY DEVICES I CAN HOOK UP TO IT AWSOME 
FOR THIS CAR I D EXPECT TO HAVE RAIN SENSITIVE WIPERS I LIVE IN AZ SO NOT A BIG DEAL
FOR THIS CAR THE RADIO SPEAKERS AND TOTAL AUDIO SYSTEM IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FOR THE SIZE AND BEAUTY OF THIS CAR IT SHOULD SOUND LIKE A DISCO 
FOR THIS EXPENSIVE AVALON THE SOUND SYSTEM COULD HAVE BEEN A PREMIUM SYSTEM 
FOR VOICE RECOGNITION CHANGE THE SOFTWARE TO THE ONE THAT HONDA IS USING IN THAT SYSTEM YO RECORD YOUR VOICE WHEN TAGGING A NAME AND THIS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FACE ANY VOICE RECOGNITION PROBLEM
FOR WHAT I PAID FOR THIS VEHICLE IT SHOULD COME STANDARD WITH HID HEADLIGHTS SHAME ON YOU NISSAN YOU REALLY MISSED THE BOAT ON THIS ONE 
FOR WHAT I USE EVERYTHING WORKS FINE 
FOR WHAT I USE IT IS GREAT
FOR WHAT I USE THE SYSTEM IS VERY EASY TO INTUITIVELY NAVIGATE IT 
FORD FACTORY SOFTWARE DOES NOT IS NOT OPERATING PROPERLY 
FORD JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER MY 11 NEW TRUCK 15 NEW CARS
FORD MYTOUCH TOO COMPLICATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM HARD TO MOVE AROUND IN THE SCREEN NEED TRAFFIC INFORMATION ON HIGHWAYS AS WELL 
FORD S MY TOUCH SYSTEM IS STILL TO SLOW TO RESPOND NEEDS A PROCESSOR UPGRADE
FORD S NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT UP THE EASE OF USE LEVEL AVAILABLE WITH GARMIN YOU CANNOT SIMPLY TYPE IN THE NAME OF A DESTINATION 
FORD S TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE
FORD SYNC DOES NOT WORK WITH OUR IPOD 
FORD SYNC SEEMS MORE POLISHED
FORD TAURUS SHO ENOUGH SAID
FORDS SYNC IS VERY GOOD WITH VOICE RECOGNITION AND CONTROLLING MY PHONE/IPOD THE TOUCHSCREEN IN THE CAR SEEMS TO BE VERY MENU BASED AND DIFFICULT IF YOU RE NOT GREAT WITH ELECTRONICS IVE HAD IT IN 2 CARS NOW AND CAN USE IT VERY WELL AND VERY PL 
FOREWARNING OF TURNS SYSTEM TELLS DRIVER TO TURN TOO LATE IF TRAFFIC IS HEAVY NEED MORE WARMING 250 FEET MAYBE???
FORMATION OF REAR WINDOW
FORMERLY OWNED THE 2014 ESCAPE OF THE SAME MODEL WAS IN AN ACCIDENT WHERE I WAS HIT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE I SUSTAINED LITTLE TO NO INJURY BUT THE CAR WAS TOTALED WE WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A 2015 ESCAPE THAT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME BECAUSE I REALLY 
FORTUNATELY THE CAR IS HIGH WITH LOTS OF VIEWABLE WINDOWS THE DRIVER IS ABLE TO SEE VERY WELL AROUND THE CAR 
FORWARD AND FORWARD ANGLE VISIBILITY IS POOR THE FRAME BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND DOOR WINDOWS A PILLAR? IS VERY THICK AND OFTEN BLOCKS LARGE CRITICAL AREAS WHEN MAKING TURNS PEDESTRIANS WATCH OUT! THE ENORMOUS SENSOR BLOCK BEHIND THE REA 
FORWARD AND SIDE VISIBILITY ARE VERY GOOD REAR VISIBILITY IS LIMITED BY WINDOW STYLING BACK UP CAMERA HELPS A LOT IN A PARKING LOT SITUATION WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE VERY GOOD THE WINDSHIELD WASHERS ARE BELOW AVERAGE PERHAPS POOR 
FORWARD AND SIDE VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED NOT AS GOOD AS MY PREVIOUS CAR 
FORWARD AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS GENERALLY VERY GOOD REAR VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REARVIEW MIRROR IS FINE BUT BACKING UP IS A CHORE THE CAR HAS A BACKUP CAMERA BUT THE DISPLAY IS TOO SMALL TO BE REALLY USEFUL IN COMPLICATED BACKING MANEUVERS T 
FORWARD COLLISION AVOIDANCE IN TRAFFIC
FORWARD COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM IS A LITTLE TOUCHY AND SOMETIMES ACTIVATES WHEN THERE IS NO CAR IN FRONT OF ME OR DOES NOT ACTIVATE WHEN THEIR IS A CAR IN FRONT OF ME 
FORWARD COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM IS ERRATIC SO CANNOT DEPEND ON IT AT ALL 
FORWARD LEFT VIEWING ANGLE IS SEVERELY LIMITED BY THE WINDSHIELD SUPPORT IT DIRECTLY IMPEDES VISION OF OTHER TRAFFIC DURING LEFT TURNS 
FORWARD POSTS ARE LARGE AND RESTRICT VISIBILITY SIDE VIEWING IS MARGINAL AND REAR WINDOW IS SMALLER THAN OTHER COMPARABLE SUVS 
FORWARD ROOF STRUTS ARE TOO WIDE THEY OBSCURE FORWARD QUARTER VISIBILITY 
FORWARD VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT IS THE BEST!
FORWARD VISIBILITY IN SMALL INDOOR CAR PARKS IS POOR
FORWARD VISIBILITY IS FINE BUT THE VISIBILITY TO THE SIDES SUFFERS DUE TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE WINDSHIELD POSTS THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR POST BETWEEN THE FRONT SEAT AND THE BACK SEAT TENDS TO BLOCK VISIBILITY TO CARS COMING FROM THE LEFT ESPECIALLY 
FORWARD VISIBILITY IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR NORMAL DRIVING HOWEVER WITH LONG ISH HOOD IT IS SLIGHTLY HARDER WHEN PARKING 
FORWARD VISIBILITY IS SUPER
FORWARD VISIBILITY IS TRICKY BECAUSE FRONT OF CAR A A LITTLE LONG MAKES PARKING A TINY BIT DIFFICULT FOR SOME 
FORWARD VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD THE WIPERS DO A GOOD JOB OF CLEANING OFF THE MAJORITY OF THE WINDSHIELD 
FORWARD VISIBILITY OVER FRONT HOOD MUCH IMPROVED OVER 2014 MODEL 
FORWARD VISIBILITY WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF THE HOOD SLANTED DOWN JUST A BIT MORE 
FOUND NAVIGATION MAP TO BE VERY HELPFUL 
FOUR POSTS ARE RATHER CUMBERSOME AND DO DETRACT FROM VISIBILITY ISSUES IN THE CAR 
FOUR WHEEL DRIVE
FOUR WHEEL DRIVE IS EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE FOR SNOW COVERED ROADS 
FRAMEWORK OBSTRUCT FORWARD VISABILITY WINDSHIELD NEEDS TO BE WIDER
FRANKLY WE DON T USE IT MUCH OTHER THAN THE RADIO GIVEN THAT WE AREN T INTO DISTRACTED DRIVING THERE S LITTLE NEED TO THE NAV SYSTEM MIGHT BE USEFUL IF WE HAD MORE NEED OF IT BUT HAVEN T IN ANY VEHICLE WE VE HAD IT IN THE VALUE OF THE SCREEN 
FREE AUX CABLE WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF I DON T WANT TO LEAVE MY PHONE IN THE GLOVE BOX TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND I THINK BLUETOOTH SHOULD COME STANDARD 
FREE MINUTES FOR HANDS FREE
FREE SATELLITE RADIO FOR THE FIRST YEAR REAR VIDEO SYSTEM WITH DVD PLAYER WIRELESS HEADPHONES ARE AWESOME 
FREE SIRIUS XM ALL THE TIME FOR THE LIFE OF THE CAR FOR WHAT THE CAR COSTS IT SEEMS PETTY TO CHARGE FOR RADIO 
FREE TRAFFIC UPDATE SERVICE LIKE YOUR 2012 HONDA CRV 
FREEWAY DRIVING TRACTION WHEN SPEND IS BEING USED
FREQUENCY OF BACKUP ALARM CANNOT HEAR IT WHEN WINDOWS ARE UP
FREQUENCY OF DROPPED CALLS
FREQUENCY SOUND OF ALARMS TOO HIGH TO HEAR
FREQUENT DROPPING OF BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO MOBILE DEVICE WHEN ENTERING/EXITING VEHICLE 
FRIENDLY AND EASY TO USE 
FRIENDLY USER INTERFACE EXCELLENT GRAPHICS VERSATILITY AND FEATURES 
FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU SIT UP HIGHER IN A MINIVAN THAN IN PASSENGER CARS ALSO LIKE THE VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS 
FROM A USER INTERFACE PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE TOO MANY INPUT AVENUES TO ACHIEVE THE SAME SYSTEM CONTROL OBJECTIVE THE NAVIGATION INTERFACE HAS TOO MANY DEAD ENDS IT NEEDS TO ACCEPT SOFTER LOGIC INPUTS AS IT IS NOW WHEN YOU GET TO A LOGICAL DEAD 
FROM DRIVER S SEAT THERE IS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO SEE BEYOND THE TOP OF THE HOOD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE 
FROM DRIVER SEAT LIGHT COLORED BARRIERS ON SIDE OF ROAD REFLECT OFF A SURFACE OF THE HOOD INTO DRIVER S EYES

FRONT VISIBILITY IS COMPROMISED AT TIMES DRIVER HAS TO BE ALERT BUT TO BE FAIR THAT IS THE RAISON D ETRE FOR A CAR LIKE THIS I E MAXIMIZING THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE

FRONT WIPERS ON PASSENGER SIDE DON T CLEAN FULL AREA INSIDE OF CAR SMELLS LIKE WASHER FLUID WHEN USING NASTY
FRONT WIPERS SHOULD HAVE A FEW MORE SETTINGS

FRONT WIPERS WEREN T VERY EFFECTIVE IN A SNOW STORM ICE AND BUILD UP FORMED ON WIPER WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND REDUCED VISIBILITY
FRONT WIPERS WORK POORLY IN THE SNOW AND RAIN 
FRONT WIPERS/WASHERS COULD BE IMPROVED IN MY OPINION THE WASHER SPRAYERS ARE NOT OPTIMAL THEY PROVIDE MORE A STREAM THAN A SPRAY AND THE WIPERS COULD BE BETTER SUN VISORS COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER AND INCLUDE LIGHT AND SIDE EXTENSIONS

GPS
GPS & BLUETOOTH FOR MUSIC USB PORT KEEPS FAILING 
GPS AND AUDIO WORKS VERY WELL
GPS AND EASE OF USING IT 
GPS BY GOOGLE ON IPHONE IS A GOOD BENCH MARK
GPS CONTROLS NOT INTUITIVE
GPS EXCELLENT
GPS FUNCTION/NAVIGATION IS NOT THAT ACCURATE I VE USED DIRECTIONS DOWNLOADED FROM OPERATOR AND ONES I HAVE ENTERED MYSELF IN BOTH CASES MY CELL PHONE DIRECTIONS MAP IS MORE ACCURATE IN THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE AND LOCATION FREQUENTLY WITH THE 
GPS HANDS FREE CALLING VIA BLUETOOTH A USB CONNECTION TO PLAY MUSIC FROM 
GPS INCLUDED IN PRICE
GPS INPUT 
GPS IS A KILLER FOR THE RATING IN THIS CATEGORY BIG STEP BACKWARDS IN A MARKET WHERE EVERY CELL PHONE HAS GOOGLE MAPS! CONNECTIVITY OF DEVICES IN THE CENTER CONSOLE UNFORGIVABLE! ENTUNE FEATURE OF PANDORA DOES NOT WORK AND IS A KNOWN ISSUE 
GPS IS HORRIBLE 
GPS IS SO EASY TO USE
GPS IS TO MUCH BETTER THAN TOYOTA WE TAKE MY CAR IF WE NEED GUIDANCE THERE S IS UNREADABLE 
GPS LACKS MANY FEATURES SUCH AS A TOUCH SCREEN
GPS LOCATION ACCURACY IT IS LOUSY
GPS NAVIGATION NOT RELIABLE� NEED TO HAVE EITHER MY OWN CELL PHONE GPS OR SOMEONE ELSE S TO ASSURE MORE ACCURATE DIRECTIONS
GPS NOT ACCURATE AND NO UPDATED AND DEALER CANNOT DO ANYTHING 
GPS REALLY LIKE REMOTE NAVIGATION 
GPS SCREEN CANT BE SEEN VERY WELL IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT CONDITIONS SCREEN NEEDS A VISOR
GPS SCREEN IS MOUNTED TO LOW HAVE TO TAKE EYES OFF THE ROAD TO VIEW IT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOUNTED HIGHER IN THE DASH AND A/C VENT LOWER 
GPS SHOULD BE MORE ACCURATE 
GPS SHOULD BE STANDARD
GPS SHOULD RESET TO FIND A NEW ROUTE AUTOMATICALLY 
GPS SYSTEM AND HANDS FREE TELEPHONE SYSTEM
GPS SYSTEM AND MAP

GPS SYSTEM IS BUGGY SEE OTHER COMMENTS USER INTERFACE IS ALSO SLUGGISH I CAN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO TURN OFF THE FEATURE THAT CONSTANTLY ASKS ME TO RECORD MY USER INFO I HAVE TO DO EVERY SINGLE TIME I TURN ON THE CAR WHICH IS ANNOYING 
GPS SYSTEM IS POOR FOR A LUXURY VEHICLE CHANGE TO A BETTER PROVIDER OR ALLOW USE OF INTERNET BASED SYSTEM EG WAZE OR GOOGLE MAPS
GPS SYSTEM MAP/DETAIL FOR ADDRESS LOCATION ACCURACY INSUFFICIENT MY 10 YEAR OLD GARMIN IS NEAR FLAWLESS ON DESTINATION ACCURACY AND DISPLAYS LOCAL SPEED LIMIT ON SCREEN NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CLUNKY TO OPERATE NO TOUCH SCREEN
GPS SYSTEM/ SIRIS NETWORK AM/FM RADIO
GPS SYSTEMS ARE VERY INEXPENSIVE THESE DAYS AND SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED NOT PART OF A BIG DOLLAR UPGRADE
GPS THAT DOESN T DIRECT A ROUTE THAT IS RIDICULOUS 
GPS UNIT IS A PIECE OF CRAP BALANCE OF THE SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD
GRAFICS ON THE SCREEN
GRAINY SCREEN OUDATED DISPLAY NOT COLORFUL NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS BAD
GRANDDAUGHTERS ENJOY BEING ABLE TO WATCH A DVD WHILE TRAVELING 
GRAPHIC EQUALIZER INSTEAD OF BASIC AUDIO FUNCTIONS WOULD ENHANCE SOUND QUALITY 
GRAPHIC OF COMING EXIT SIGNS IS UNIQUE AND BECAUSE OF THE 8 5 SIZE SCREEN IS OUTSTANDING 
GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE COULD BE UPGRADED LOOKS OLDER AND DOESN T FEEL REFINED OR COMPLETE
GRAPHICAL APPEARANCE OF DIRECTIONS ESPECIALLY HOW THE EXIT SIGNS ON THE ROAD APPEAR ALMOST IDENTICAL ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN
GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE GUI LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM THE 1990 S WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM UNLESS IT IS TRULY USER FRIENDLY WITH LOOK AND FEEL SIMILAR TO WEB BROWSER CHROME IE FIREFOX ETC

GRAPHICS ARE SHARP EASY TO READ AND IN COLOR WHICH IS NICE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND PROVIDES VERY GOOD INFORMATION THE SOUND SYSTEM IS EXCEPTIONAL 
GRAPHICS AREN T AS GOOD AS YOUR COMPETITION HANDS FREE CONTROL IS A NIGHTMARE LIKE YOUR COMPETITION MAYBE ANOTHER GENERATION BEFORE IT WORKS SEAMLESSLY 
GRAPHICS COULD BE BETTER OWNED A 2010 AUDI Q5 THAT HAD A BETTER SYSTEM THAT WAS 5 YEARS AGO 
GRAPHICS OF NAVIGATION ARE DATED AND IT IS SLOW TO REACT TO COMMANDS SUCH AS ZOOM IN 
GRAPHICS OF PANEL COULD HAVE A MORE MODERN LOOK 
GRAPHICS OF THE AUDIO DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
GRAPHICS OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE IMPROVED
GRAPHICS ON SCREEN AND SOUND OF STEREO SYSTEM
GRAPHICS ONSCREEN ARE A LITTLE DATED GPS IS OUT OF DATE SOME BUSINESSES HAVE MOVED OR CLOSED AND SYSTEM DOESN T FEFLECT THOSE CHANGES

HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE BRIGHTER
HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE BRIGHTER 
HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE BRIGHTER BEING THAT MOST CARS HAVE THE BRIGHTER LIGHTS AND THE PATHFINDER HAS THE IN BETWEEN LIGHTS IF SPENDING THIS KIND OF MONEY SPEND ANOTHER $100 00 ON UPGRADING THE LIGHTS 
HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE HID 
HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE HID OR HALOGEN PROJECTOR ASSEMBLIES SUBARU USES LOUSY HALOGEN REFLECTOR HEADLAMPS THAT ILLUMINATE THE TOPS OF TREES WHICH IS UNNECESSARY I PREFER HEADLAMPS THAT ARE FOCUSED FOR DISTANCE INSTEAD OF UNFOCUSED FOR WIDE LATERA 
HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE TILTED UP I FEEL LIKE I M OFTEN OVERDRIVING MY HEADLIGHTS EVEN WHEN GOING LESS THAN 50 MPH
HEADLIGHTS SHOULD GO ON WHEN WIPERS ARE TURNED ON

HEADRESTS ARE TOO HIGH
HEADRESTS ARE TOO LARGE AND IMPEDE VISION CANNOT REMOVE 2ND AND 3RD ROW HEADRESTS L
HEADRESTS BLOCK SIDE AND REAR VIEWS 
HEADRESTS BLOCK VIEW FROM REAR VIEW MIRROR THE REAR CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL BUT STILL USE REAR VIEW MIRROR COULD HEADRESTS BE REMOVABLE OR FOLD DOWN INTO SEATS SO VIEW WOULD BE BETTER 
HEADRESTS BLOCK VIEWS OUT REAR SIDE WINDOWS AN REAR HEADRESTS BLOCK REAR VIEW MIRROR 
HEADRESTS CAUSE HUGE BLIND SPOTS IN PERIPHERAL AND REAR VIEW VISIONS!
HEADRESTS FRONT ROW/SECOND ROW REDUCE VISIBILITY AM APPRECIATIVE OF REAR VIEW CAMERA TO CONFIRM REAR CLEARANCE/ABSENCE OF OBJECTS I PLACED SMALL BOXES AROUND REAR OF VEHICLE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE BLIND SPOTS IF ANY SHORTLY AFTER ACQUIRING 
HEADRESTS IMPAIR SEEING OUT OF VEHICLE
HEADRESTS IN BACK IMPAIR BACKUP VISION

HI BEAMS
HID HEADLIGHTS AND DRIVING LIGHTS SHOULD BE THE STANDARD NOT THE EXCEPTION THE VEHICLE HAS TO MANY BLIND SPOTS 
HID HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE STANDARD
HID HEADLIGHTS WORK GREAT!
HID IS A MUST AND THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS ARE REALLY NICE TO HAVE SO YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS 
HID LIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL
HID LIGHTS ARE LONG OVERDUE
HID LIGHTS MAKE SEEING EASY 
HID OR LED UPGRADED LIGHTING
HID WOULD BE GREAT FOR VISIBILITY 
HIDDEN STEERING CONTROLS ARE NICE BUT DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER THEM ALL SINCE THEY ARE ON THE BACK OF THE WHEEL
HIDS NOT BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE 2015 MODEL WAS A HUGE LET DOWN FOR THE PRICE AND CLASS OF THE CAR 
HIGH ALL AROUND VISIBILITY WAS A KEY FACTOR IN BUYING
HIGH BEAM HEAD LIGHTING SEEMS SCATTERED AND NOT VERY USEFUL THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA IS OUTSTANDING IN ACCURATELY DISPLAYING DISTANCES TO MATCH VEHICLE LENGTH AND TURN RADIUS 
HIGH BEAM IS NOT AS BRIGHT AND CLEAR AS LOW BEAM WHEN YOU CHANGE TO HIGH BEAM THE LIGHT TAKES ON A YELLOW TINT AND DOES NOT ILLUMINATE AS WELL AS WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE ON LOW BEAM 
HIGH BEAM SEEMS TO BE AIMED TOO HIGH I FREQUENTLY GET FLASHING HEADLAMPS FROM ONCOMING DRIVERS

HIGH BEAMS INEFFECTIVE I CHOSE RETRO STYLING
HIGH BEAMS NOT THAT GREAT
HIGH BEAMS RATHER POOR RIGHT WIPER BLADE STREAKS EVEN AFTER CHANGING BLADES 
HIGH BEAMS SEEM TO POINT UP INTO THE TREES TO MUCH
HIGH BEAMS TOO NARROW AND TOO POINTED TOO HIGH 
HIGH BELTLINE DIFFICULT FOR KIDS TO SEE OUT THE BACK

HONDA ADDED 2 CAMERAS TO THE EX MODEL THE SIDE VIEW CAMERA FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR COMES ON ANY TIME YOU USE THE INDICATOR TO TURN OR CHANGE LANES TO THE RIGHT YOU CAN ALSO MANUALLY TURN IT ON ANY TIME YOU LIKE TO SEE THE EXTERIOR PASSENG 
HONDA APP SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERFACE WITH PHONES OTHER THAN THE IPHONE 5 AND NEWER 
HONDA DID A GREAT JOB WITH THE PILOT I HOPE IT CONTINUES IN FUTURE MODELS
HONDA HAS SUPERIORLY DESIGNED THE 2015 FIT TO BE DRIVER CENTERED/FOCUSED THERE IS TRULY PERFECT VISIBILITY 
HONDA LINK NAVIGATION VOICE ACTIVATION
HONDA VEHICLES HAVE ALWAYS HAD ISSUES WITH HIGH QUALITY SOUND SYSTEMS MY VW JETTA HAD A FAR SUPERIOR SOUND THEY SOUND LIKE THE OLD PIORNEER BRAND SYSTEMS ALWAYS ON THE DULL SIDE NOT ALIVE WITH HIGHS AND FINER SOUNDS 
HONDALINK
HONDALINK APP
HONDALINK IT DOES NOT LOAD CONSISTENTLY SOMETIMES I ONLY GET A BLANK SCREEN AND SOMETIMES IT LOADS AS IT SHOULD I AM USING AN IPHONE 5S 
HONESTLY I DON T USE IT EXCEPT FOR WEATHER UPDATES IN THE MOUNTAINS I REALLY DON T HAVE MUCH USEFUL TO SAY ABOUT IT 
HONESTLY IF I HAD THE RESOURCES I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE MODEL WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN BECAUSE IT HAD ALL THE APPLICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS THE MODEL I PURCHASED HAS A DECENT SYSTEM BUT YOU CAN TELL MORE TIME WAS SPENT WITH THE OTHER MODEL S SYSTE 
HONESTLY IT MAY JUST BE ME BEING MIDDLE AGED BUT I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME FIGURING OUT HOW THE MENU USED FOR SETTING UP THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WORKS 
HONESTLY IT S JUST SLOW TO RESPOND AND LOAD IMPATIENCE ON BEHALF MAY BE MORE OF THE ISSUE!
HOOD CHROME EMBLEMS ARE A HAZARD IN CERTAIN SUN ANGLES AS THEY REFLECT GLARE INTOM DRIVER S EYES ANOTHER SUN VISOR WOULD BE HELPFUL TO SHIELD FRONT & SIDE OF FIELD OF VISION

I A SHORT PERSON 5 2 SO I AM NOT SURPRISED THAT I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING IF A CAR IS IN MY BLIND SPOT WHEN I TURN TO LOOK I HAVE THE DRIVER S SEAT ADJUSTED SO THAT IT IS ABOUT AS HIGH AS IT WILL GO AND I GET A NICE VIEW OF THE BACK SEAT WITH 
I ABSOLUTELY HATE THAT I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROGRAM MY MUSIC FAVORITES I HAVE READ THE OWNERS MANUAL AND IT DOES NOT MATCH THE MODEL OF IMPALA I HAVE I HAVE ALSO TRIED EVERY BUTTON AVAILABLE ON THE SCREENS AND I CANNOT GET IT TO PROGRAM AN 
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURES!

I ACTUALLY HAVE NOT USED ALL THE FEATURES BUT THIS DOES NOT SEEN M TO BE AN OPTION ON YOUR SURVEY
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT WHILE RESEARCHING VARIOUS VEHICLES PRIOR TO PURCHASING THE SCION THAT IT CAME WITH A FACTORY BACK UP CAMERA AND VEHICLE STATISTICS AS STANDARD FEATURES I WAS WRONG IT SEEMS 
I ADDED A 180 MIRROR TO SEE IN BLIND SPOT 
I ADDED CONVEX MIRRORS TO SEE PASSING CARS OR CARS TO MY IMMEDIATE RIGHT
I ADDED SMALL RECTANGULAR BLIND SPOT MIRRORS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE DRIVER AND PASSENGER MIRRORS AND HAVE ELIMINATED THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES 
I ADDED SOME CONVEX MIRRORS TO AID IN SEEING VEHICLES WHILE CHANGING LANES

I ALREADY COMMENTED ON THE DIFFICULTY I EXPERIENCED WITH BLUE LINK I WILL REQUEST ASSISTANCE WHEN MY FIRST SERVICE APPOINTMENT
I ALREADY COMMUNICATED MY ISSUES WITH THE NAVI AND THE PHONE ISSUES
I ALREADY HAD ONE COMMENT ABOUT VISIBILITY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WITH THE DRIVER S SEAT ALL THE WAY BACK WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD TO THE LEFT TO CHECK FOR OTHER VEHICLES WHEN YOU ARE CHANGING LANES YOU ARE LOOKING RIGHT AT THE ROOF PILLAR

I ALWAYS LINE TO SEE THE LEFT FRONT FENDER WHEN DRIVING AND PARKING I CANNOT IN THIS CAR
I ALWAYS TURN AROUND TO CHECK CHANGING LANES AND THE PART OF THE CAR BETWEEN BACK WINDOW AND BACK WINDSHIELD BLOCKS MY VISION 
I ALWAYS WANT TO SEE MORE WHEN I CHECK THE REAR VIEW USING THE REAR VIEW CAMERA I DO FIND THE SHADING ON THE SCREEN THAT IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW SAFETY ZONES ACTUALLY DECREASES MY ABILITY TO SEE THE AREA I PREFERRED THE VIEW FROM MY 2008 INFINITI 
I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT BLIND SPOTS I WAS HIT ON DRIVER S SIDE FRONT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE THAT ALERT YOU MENTIONED A FEW TIMES

I AM A SHORT PERSON IT ISN T ALWAYS EASY TO FIND A VEHICLE THAT CAN ADJUST PERFECTLY FOR ME IT CAN BE A CHALLENGE AT TIMES TO SEE ONCOMING TRAFFIC ON THE INTERSTATE 
I AM A SHORT PERSON MY SEAT COULD BE A BIT HIGHER TO SEE OVER THE HOOD A BIT BETTER UNRELATED FOR OUR FAMILY THE SUN ROOF IS USELESS UNUSED A FEATURE THAT COULD BE OMITTED 
I AM A SHORT PERSON THE SUN VISORS AND MIDDLE FRONT VISOR REALLY HELPS WHEN DRIVING INTO THE SUN 
I AM A SHORTER PERSON 5 4 AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE BACK WHEN BACKING UP 
I AM A SMALLER WOMAN AND THIS CAR FITS ME TO A TEE!!!
I AM A STICKLER FOR HEADLIGHTS SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I DROVE MY BEETLE FOR THE FIRST TIME AT NIGHT AND COULDN T SEE ANYTHING MY DEALER WAS ABLE TO GET ME IN THE NEXT DAY AND ADJUST THE LIGHTS AND THEY ARE MUCH BETTER THEY STILL SEEM TO HA 
I AM A VERY SHORT PERSON AND THE BLIND SPOT FACTOR IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH 
I AM A WOMAN 5 4 TALL AND HAVE DIFFICULTY JUDGING FRONT BUMPER DISTANCES TO TARGET AS I CANNOT SEE HOW MUCH MORE ROOM I HAVE TO GO TILL I MUST STOP 
I AM ABLE TO ACCESS WHATEVER MODE I WANT WITH ONE STEP
I AM ABLE TO BE HANDSFREE WITH THE PHONE THE RADIO IS VERY USER FRIENDLY
I AM ABLE TO CONNECT AND DISCONNECT WITHOUT PICKING UP OR LOOKING AT MY PHONE 
I AM ABLE TO EASILY USE ALL THE FUNCTIONS I NEED 
I AM ABLE TO HEAR CELL CALLS MUCH MORE CLEARER 
I AM ABLE TO HEAR MY TEXT MESSAGES 
I AM ABLE TO HEAR THE AUDIO OVER THE OUTSIDE NOISE AND TIRE NOISE ON THE ROAD 
I AM ABLE TO LISTEN TO PANDORA 
I AM ABLE TO SET THE THREE REAR VIEW MIRROR TO COVER THREE LANES VERY SUCCESSFULLY I HAVE NOT COME TO A HIGH COMFORT LEVEL OF USING THE FISH EYE MIRROR SECTIONS ON THE TWO EXTERIOR MIRROR WOULD PREFER AN ELECTRONIC WARNING SYSTEM FOR BLIND SPOTS 
I AM ALWAYS TROUBLED WHEN BACKING THIS VEHICLE 
I AM AMAZED AT HOW USEFUL THE BACKUP CAMERA AND WARNING SYSTEM IS THAT ALERTS FOR VEHICLES/PEOPLE COMING DOWN THE PARKING AISLE IS ON THE CAR 
I AM AMAZED THAT TOYOTA IS NOT OFFERING LED OR AT LEAST HID HEADLIGHTS ON THIS VEHICLE 
I AM AN AUDIOFILE AND THE SOUND IN THIS CAR IS OK ALTHOUGH I DID NOT BUY THIS CAR FOR THE STEREO IT IS FINE FOR WHAT I NEED BUT IT IS NOTHING SPECIAL OR SPECTACULAR
I AM AN OLD MAN AND DO NOT USE MOST OF THE FEATURES I LISTEN TO THE RADIO IT S OK
I AM AN OLDER DRIVER AND I HAVE DIFFICULTY TURNING MY NECK TO LOOK BEHIND ME I DEPEND ON MY MIRRORS THIS STILL LEAVES A SMALL BLIND SPOT I INSTALL A SMALL AFTERMARKET CONCAVE MIRROR TO ASSIST IN VISIBILITY IN ALL MY VEHICLES 
I AM AN OLDER DRIVER AND THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS STILL OUT OF MY LEAGUE I PLAN TO GET USED TO IT AND USE IT TO ITS FULL CAPACITY 
I AM AWARE THAT THE VISIBILITY ON THE RIGHT REAR VIEW MIRROR AS WELL AS CENTER REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN WISHING TO MOVE OVER FROM A LEFT LANE TO RIGHT LANE MIGHT BE BETTER I FIND THAT I NEED TO REALLY BE AWARE OF THE CLOSENESS OF A CAR WHICH SOMET 
I AM BAD WITH THE HEADLIGHTS NOT SURE WHICH ONE IS FOG LIGHT OR HOW TO TURN DIAL CORRECTLY I JUST KEEP IT ON AUTOMATIC COULD LOOK IN MANUAL AND FIGURE OUT EASILY OR EVEN BY EXPEREMENTING JUST HARD TO REMEMBER WHEN I NEED IT 
I AM BARELY 5 FT SO VISERS DON T WORK FOR ME REGARDLESS OF POSITION FRONT OR SIDE I WISH I COULD PULL THE WHOLE PANEL DOWN MORE
I AM COMPLETELY SATISFIED IN THIS AREA 
I AM CONCERNED AS THERE ARE HORRIBLE BLIND SPOTS IN THE FRONT ESPECIALLY ON A CURVE THE WINDOW TRIM ON THE FRONT GLASS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS ON TURNS 
I AM CONCERNED I CAN NOT SEE IN MY BLINDSPOT EXCEPT WITH USE OF BMS THE OUTSIDE SIDE MIRRORS ARE ALSO TOO LARGE AND OBSTRUCT MY VIEW WHEN I M ENTERING A ROAD
I AM CONFLICTED ABOUT SAYING ANYTHING NEGATIVE BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE MORE I GET USED TO MY VEHICLE THE EASIER IT IS TO SEE OUT OF IT HOWEVER THAT WAS THE HARDEST ADJUSTMENT TO MOVING INTO A VEHICLE OF THIS SIZE 
I AM CONTENT AS IS 
I AM DEAF SO I CANNOT HELP WITH THE QUALITY RELATED TO SOUNDS 
I AM DELIGHTED WITH THE ABILITY TO SEE BEHIND ME CLEARLY AND IN ALL NECESSARY AREAS FROM THE DRIVER SEAT
I AM DIRECTIONALLY CHALLENGED SO I REALLY LIKE THE ARROWS ON THE DISPLAY THAT SHOW LEFT AND RIGHT AND NOT NORTH OR SOUTH 
I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE SIRUS XM
I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT MY IPHONE DOES NOT CONNECT TO MY NEW HONDA MESSAGING DOES NOT WORK/PHONE CALLS DO BUT ALL THE COOL STUFF DOES NOT THE HDMI PORT AND ELECTRICAL OUTLET FOR THE DUAL SCREEN SECOND SCREEN IS POORLY POSITIONED IN THE CAR 
I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THE LIGHTS ARE NOT AUTOMATIC THIS IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET USED TO 
I AM DISAPPOINTED THE REAR WINDOWS DON T GO DOWN ALL OF THE WAY 
I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO CALL SOMEONE IT NEVER RECOGNIZES THE NAMES IN MY PHONE BOOK AND I HAVE TO PICK UP MY PHONE TO DIAL 
I AM EASILY CONFUSED BY ALL THE BUTTONS I WISH EACH SYSTEM HAD THEIR OWN CONTROL BUTTON RATHER THAN RUNNING IT THROUGH A CENTER MENU BUTTON I HAVEN T USED THE STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS YET I NEVER HAD THEM AND I AM NOT USED TO CONTROLLING THING 
I AM ENJOYING ALL AS IT IS A FIRST FOR ME!
I AM ENJOYING BEING ABLE TO SEE IN ALL DIRECTIONS AGAIN I NO LONGER FEEL AS IF I AM PEERING OUT OF A SMALL PORTHOLE AND AM NOT SURE WHAT I SEE 
I AM ENJOYING THE SATELLITE RADIO SUBSCRIPTION 
I AM EXPIERENCING POOR QUALITY FROM AM RADIO RECEPTION COULD BE SOME ADJUSTMENT WILL ASK WHEN I HAVE MY FIRST SERVICE VISIT THANKS
I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH THE AUDIO SYSTEM VOICE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN WORKING WELL WHEN I LEARN THE PROPER VOICE COMMANDS IT WOULD BE NICE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION TO UNDERSTAND STRANGE STREET NAMES NAVIGATION WORKS VERY WELL BUT I FIND SOMETIM 
I AM FAIRLY SHORT 5 2 5 AND MY VISIBILITY IS GREAT HEIGHT OF VEHICLE IS GREAT REAR CAMERA IS GREAT FEATURE 
I AM FAIRLY TALL AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR MOUNTED A BIT HIGHER 
I AM FEEL VERY SAFE DRIVING
I AM FIVE FEET TALL SUN VISORS DON T ALWAYS SHIELD MY EYES 
I AM GETTING OLDER AND NEED READING GLASSES IT IS HARD FOR ME TO READ SOME OF THE CONTROLS WHILE DRIVING 
I AM GETTING USED TO THE SMALLER WINDOW IN THE BACK IT HINDERS MY VISUAL AM MAKING ADJUSTMENTS
I AM GLAD THE VEHICLE HAS THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS BECAUSE THIS CAR HAS THE BIGGEST BLIND SPOTS OF ANY I VE EVER DRIVEN IT WAS INITIALLY QUITE DISCONCERTING BUT I VE NOW GOTTEN USED TO IT 
I AM GOING TO REMOVE THE REAR HEADRESTS TO GAIN BETTER REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY 
I AM GOING TO TELL YOU THE ONE ASPECT THAT I DO NOT LIKE THE INABILITY TO CHARGE CELL PHONE UNLESS VEHICLE IS RUNNING IS TRULY UNACCEPTABLE I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE MY PHONE PLUGGED INTO THE PORT WHEN I AM GOING TO TURN OFF THE VEHICLE AND R 
I AM GOING TO UPGRADE HEADLIGHTS SINCE THE VEHICLE RIDES LOW I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE THIRD BRAKE LIGHT MOUNTED HIGHER I DO HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING TRAFFIC AROUND ME USING THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS
I AM HAPPY ABOUT MY VEHICLE S VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY 
I AM HAPPY WITH IT
I AM HAPPY WITH THE TRAVERSE
I AM HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THE MMI SYSTEM I MUST RETURN TO MY DEALERSHIP WHEN I HAVE TIME 
I AM HAVING ISSUES WITH MY IPHONE 6 INTERACTING WITH THE AUDIO SYSTEM PERIODICALLY I VE ATTEMPTED TO HOOK THE DEVICE UP THROUGH THE USB CONNECTOR AND IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE THE DEVICE AT ALL WHEN I CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH I HAVE PERIODIC ISSUES 
I AM HAVING TROUBLE PLAYING VIDEO FILES ON THE INTERNAL VIDEO SYSTEM I CAN T SEEM TO GET THE VIDEO FORMAT CORRECTLY 
I AM HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY CAR S IPOD INTERFACE IT MAY JUST BE MY PARTICULAR CAR THE OVERALL MAXIMUM VOLUME OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE HIGHER 
I AM HEARING IMPAIRED AND DO NOT USE THE AUDIO COMMUNICATIONS OR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS MUCH AS I CAN T UNDERSTAND THEM AND IT DISTRACTS FROM MY DRIVING I M AFRAID MY ANSWERS FOR THIS SECTION ARE NOT ACCURATE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED 
I AM HEARING IMPAIRED SO PHONE WITH BLUE TOOTH IS GREAT!!! I DO NOT TEXT OR USE OTHER GADGETS WHILE DRIVING 
I AM HEARING IMPAIRMENT WISH TO HAVE BETTER ACCESSIBILITY FOR DEAF PEOPLE SUCH FLASH WARNING SYSTEM AT SAME TIME AUDIO WARNING OR ALERTS 
I AM IN LOVE WITH MY CAR
I AM JUST NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON TO USE A LOT OF DIGITAL CONTROLS 
I AM LEARNING TO TRUST THE BACKUP CAMERA
I AM LEFT HANDED SO FOR ME IT IS A BIT AWKWARD RO USE THE CONTROLS IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE CONTROLS WERE MORE SUITABLE FOR LEFT HANDED PEOPLE 
I AM LOVING THE AUDIO SYSTEM AND TOTALLY PLEASED WITH HAVING THE SIRIUS 
I AM MOST EXCITED ABOUT THE HANDS FREE OPTIONS ALLOWING ME TO FOCUS ON DRIVING 
I AM MOST FRUSTRATED WITH THE BUILT IN INTERNET POOR CONNECTIVITY AND FREQUENTLY DISCONNECTED 
I AM MOST HAPPY WITH MY NEW RAV4 MY ONLY WISH IS THAT MY NEW RAV4 WERE AN UPGRADED MODEL SO I CAN ENJOY EVEN MORE ABOUT IT I DIDN T KNOW I WOULD BE THIS HAPPY WITH MY NEW RAV4 I DROVE A KIA SERENTO FOR 7 YEARS BECAUSE I DIDN T KNOW WHAT I WAS 
I AM NEW TO MUCH OF THE NEWER SYSTEMS THEREFORE I AM STILL LEARNING I LIKE THE THINGS I KNOW HOW TO WORK AND I HOPE IN TIME I CAN FIGURE OUT THE OTHER SYSTEMS IE CRUISE CONTROL AND APPS ETC 
I AM NOT A CAR DESIGNER 
I AM NOT A CAR PERSON BUT LOVE DRIVING THIS CAR 
I AM NOT A FAN OF HAVING THE TWO WIND SHIELD WASHERS ON THE HOOD IN SNOW AND ICE I CAN T SPRAY MY WINDSHIELD WHEN I GET TRUCK SPRAY SURELY THERE IS SOME SORT OF HEAT THAT COULD BE ROUTED TO THE AREA UNDER THE WIPER BLADES TO DEFROST AND MELT I 
I AM NOT A FAN OF THE JOY STICK APPROACH TO A NAVIGATION SYSTEM WAY TOO TIME CONSUMING 
I AM NOT A FAN OF THE MOUSE ON THE CONSOLE I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING I LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN ON MY PREVIOUS LS BETTER
I AM NOT A FAN OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR THE AUDIO PART IS ANNOYING AND DISTRCTING I RARELY USE IT
I AM NOT A HUGE FAN OF HOW THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOOKS WHEN I HAVE THE GUIDANCE ON I PREFER TO USE THE PERSPECTIVE VIEW I FIND IT TO LOOK A BIT BUSY I MUCH PREFERRED THE NAV SYSTEM IN MY 2007 BMW 
I AM NOT A TALL PERSON AND SOMETIMES THE VISIBILITY WHILE TURNING RIGHT OR LEFT IS BLOCKED BY THE LOCATION OF THE FRONT WINDOW POSTS IT IS ALSO SOMETIME DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE THE FRONT RIGHT PORTION OF THE CAR IS IN REFERENCE TO ANOTHER CAR WHI 
I AM NOT A TECHNO GEEK SO 90% OF THIS HIGH TECH STUFF IS WASTED ON ME I USE A CAR FOR TRANSPORTATION NOT AS AN ENTERTAINMENT OR INFORMATION CENTER 
I AM NOT A VERY TECHNICAL PERSON BUT I FIND THE SYSTEMS IN THE CAR VERY EASY TO USE I AM SURE THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT I DO NOT USE THE ONES I DO USE I USE OFTEN 
I AM NOT ABLE TO COMMENT ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS I HAVEN T USED IT YET 
I AM NOT ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE VOICE COMMANDS ON ANY THING EXCEPT PHONE
I AM NOT ABLE TO USE MY IPOD EASILY OR MY MUSIC COLLECTION THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM STILL NEEDS UPGRADES OFTENTIMES TAKES ME ROUND AND ROUND TO GET TO A DESTINATION RATHER THAN A DIRECT ROUTE FRUSTRATING
I AM NOT AN APPLE USER IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A MORE ANDROID USER FRIENDLY SYSTEM I USE MY PHONE TO PLAY MUSIC AND I CAN USE A USB CORD TO PLAY MUSIC EXCEPT THAT THE SYSTEM DOESN T RECOGNIZE MY CONNECTION AND THERE IS ALWAYS A DELAY WHEN SKI 
I AM NOT AN AUDIOPHILE SO AM ONLY AWAY OF SOUND NOT SOUNDING CRISP MAYBE MY OLD HEARING MEANS I HAVE TO TURN IT UP TOO FAR HAD TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER S FOR FUNCTION HELP I NEED A MANUAL FOR DUMMIES! NOT SAFE WHEN I M TRYING TO FIGURE IT 
I AM NOT AN ENGINEER I LISTEN MOSTLY TO SPORTS TALK RADIO 
I AM NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE NAV SYSTEM THE AUDIO AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ARE OK 
I AM NOT DISAPPOINTED IN ANY OF THESE ITEMS
I AM NOT EXPERIENCED USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY SO I DON T USE SYSTEMS VERY MUCH I HAVE NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE SO NOTHING TO USE AS A COMPARISON TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS 
I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH YOUR ATTEMPT TO ELIMINATE THE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE THE SPLIT MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE IS VERY INEFFECTIVE THE CAMERA ON THE RIGHT MIRROR IS OKEY BUT I DON T RELY ON IT COMPLETELY 
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN A LOT OF CONNECTIVITY IN MY CAR MOST OF IT IS WASTED ON ME 
I AM NOT SURE HOW HELPFUL TRAFFIC INFO IS 
I AM NOT SURE HOW TO USE IT IT MAKES ME UNCOFORTABLE BECAUSR I HAVE NEVER USED ONE BEFORE 
I AM NOT SURE IF I HAVE LANE DEPARTURE BUT IF I DO I AM NOT SURE HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK 
I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS DUE TO THE LACK OF SPEAKERS BUT THE SYSTEM DOESN T SOUND ROBUST ALSO I HAVE TRIED TO PROGRAM THE RADIO SO THAT WHEN I TURN THE RADIO ON THE VOLUME IS AUTOMATICALLY SET AT THE MEDIUM SELECTION THE SELECTION WILL NO 
I AM NOT SURE IF ITS JUST ME BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE LEFT FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT I HAVE TO MOVE UP AND FORWARD TO TRULY SEE THE LEFT SIDE THRU THE FRONT WINDOW 
I AM NOT SURE WHAT IT WILL DO MEANING I AM NOT SURE OF ALL THE THINGS IT WILL DO 
I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS 
I AM NOT TECH SAVVY I DON T USE THE EQUIPMENT OFTEN ENOUGH TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH ITS USE 
I AM NOT TECHNICALLY SAVVY MORE AID IN USING THE SYSTEMS EFFICIENTLY WOULD BE HELPFUL 
I AM NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH IT 
I AM NOT THAT YOUNG AND IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CAR IS TECHY WHICH IS THE GOOD NEWS AND THE BAD NEWS I HAVE ONE 2 YEARS OLDER AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT ONE BUT STILL A LOT OF INFORMATION FOR AN OLDER PERSON WE A 
I AM NOT THRILLED AT THE QUALITY OF SOUND COMING FROM THE SPEAKERS
I AM NOT TOO PLEASED SOUND QUALITY ADJUSTMENT 
I AM NOT USED TO HAVING TO RELY ON THE WIDE ANGLE MIRROR TO CHECK MY BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES YET OTHER THAN THAT I FEEL VERY SAFE IN MY FIAT 500 
I AM NOT USED TO USING AUDIO WHILE DRIVING JUST RADIO MUSIC 
I AM NOT VERY INFORMED ON THE LATEST ELECTRONICS
I AM NOT VERY TECH SAVVY AND HAVE NOT HAD MUCH TIME TO SIT DOWN AND STUDY THE USE OF THE FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE I KNOW FROM HAVING 2 MERCEDES SUVS IN THE PAST THAT THIS IS A MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY SYSTEM SO I WOULD CHALK IT UP TO USER INEXPERIENCE 
I AM NOT VERY TECK SAVY SO HAVE NOT REALLY EXPERIENCED ALL THE FEATURES 
I AM NOT YET COMFORTABLE WITH THE NAV SYSTEM IN THIS CAR YET I NEED TO REVIEW AND STUDY THE APPLICATIONS FURTHER IT IS DIFFERENT FROM MY PRIOR VEHICLE WHICH I AM STILL USED TO 
I AM NOT YET TOTALLY CONFIDENT OF CHANGING LANES OR MERGING BUT FEEL IT WILL IMPROVE SIDE AVOIDANCE BEING REPAIRED ANY MORE TIME WITH THE VEHICLE 
I AM OLD SCHOOL NO CELL AND NO OTHER STUFF
I AM OLD SCHOOL WOULD HAVE LIKED A C/D PLAYER 
I AM OLDER AND PREFER TO HAVE BUTTONS FOR MY STATIONS THE TOUCH SCREEN IS HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING AND I DON T FEEL COMFORTABLE TRYING TO USE THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL AS IT REQUIRES TOO MUCH CONCENTRATION FROM ME JUST NOT USED TO 
I AM ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE LEFT WHO DO NOT OWN A CELL PHONE SO I REALLY CAN T ANSWER THESE TYPE QUESTIONS 
I AM ONLY 5 2 AND SOMETIMES THE BLIND SPOTS ARE TRICKY AND WHEN THE ANGLE OF THE SUN IS LOW ENOUGH I HAVE TO RAISE MYSELF UP A BIT BUT I THINK THE CAR IS DESIGNED WELL WITH AVERAGE HEIGHT FOLKS IN MIND AND I AM OKAY WITH THAT 
I AM ONLY 5 5 AND WHEN REVERSING I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW IF THE SEAT HEADRESTS ARE IN THE UP POSITION 
I AM ONLY 5FT2 THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IN THE CMAX IS HUGE THE SUN VISOR SEEMS A LITTLE UNDERSIZED FOR THE WINDOW NO MATTER HOW HIGH I RAISE MY SEAT I AM UNABLE TO DRIVE DIRECTLY INTO THE SUN AND GET ENOUGH VISOR COVERAGE TO FEEL TOTALLY SAFE 
I AM ONLY MUSIC LISTENER BUT NOT MUCH WHILE I AM DRIVING TO WORK MAY BE I USE IT MORE WHIN I TRAVEL LONGER DISTANCE
I AM PERSONALLY OPPOSED TO HAVING DISTRACTING TECH FEATURES IN A CAR EXCEPT FOR A EMERGENCY CELL PHONE AND RADIO 
I AM PLEASED 
I AM PLEASED WITH MY CAR I MISS THE SIDE POCKETS ON CONSOLE I HAD ON MY 2012
I AM PLEASED WITH MY NEW VEHICLE
I AM PLEASED WITH THE ACCURACY DETAIL AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE DRIVING TO UNKNOWN PLACES KNOWING IT WILL GET ME THERE 
I AM PLEASED WITH THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM MY SISTER NEARLY ALWAYS CALLS ME WHILE I AM I CAR IT MAKES CONVERSATION SAFER AND MUCH EASIER 
I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS 
I AM REALLY GLAD TO HAVE IT BUT I DON T COMMUTE LONG DISTANCES SO I AM NOT IN THE CAR LONG ENOUGH TO RELY ON THIS FEATURE BUT WHEN I DO I HAVE SOME FRUSTRATION WITH THE RECOGNITION COMMAND VOICE COMMAND AND FINDING CHANNELS WHEN I WANT TO SWI 
I AM REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE VISIBILITY OF THE WINDOWS THEY ARE VERY BIG AND I CAN SEE AROUND THE WHOLE VEHICLE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE FOUND IS THAT BECAUSE THE WINDOWS ARE SO BIG I HAVE HAD A HARD TIME FINDING A VISOR TO FIT THAT SIZE WINDOW MY 
I AM REALLY SURPRISED AT HOW POORLY THE WIPERS PERFORM DURING WINTER CONDITIONS PARTICULARLY WITH ICE MY PREVIOUS 2011 3 SERIES BMW DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM HOWEVER THE WIPERS BLADES WERE BIGGER ON THE OLDER CAR 
I AM RETIRED AND I HAVE NOT USED ANY OF IT ONLY THE RADIO
I AM RETIRED AS A FIREFIGHTER AND MY SON AND SON IN LAW ARE CURRENTLY FIREFIGHTERS BOTH OF THEM HAVE SEEN ROLLOVERS AND COLLISIONS INVOLVING THE BUICK ENCLAVE AND THEY WERE AMAZED AT HOW THE OCCUPANTS WALKED AWAY FROM ACCIDENTS THAT OTHERWIS 
I AM S SHORT PERSON AND IN THIS CAR I HAVE GREAT VISIBILITY ALL AROUND LOVE THAT FACT 
I AM SATISFIED
I AM SATISFIED FOR MY HONDA CIVIC ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF IT BUT ONLY MY COMMENT THE BACK CHAIR ARE CLOSER TO THE FRONT SIT WHEN YOU SITTING ON THE BACK YOUR KNEE TOUCHING THE FRONT SIT MAYBE NEED MORE A LITTLE BIT ADJUSTMENT FOR THE LENGTH OF 
I AM SATISFIED WITH THESE SYSTEMS 
I AM SHORT & VISORS ARE NEVER RIGHT FOR ME ALSO WISH THEY HAD A PART THAT COULD COVER THE SIDE WINDOW FOR WHEN DRIVING INTO THE RISING OR SETTING SUN
I AM SHORT 4 10 AND I LIKE THAT I CAN SIT UP HIGH ENOUGH TO SEE EASILY GM DOES A GOOD JOB MAKING CARS COMFORTABLE FOR SHORT WOMEN 
I AM SHORT 5 FEET BUT EVEN SO THE VEHICLE IS EASY TO OPERATE 
I AM SHORT AND HAVE A BIT OF HESITATION WHEN CHANGING LANES EITHER WAY 
I AM SHORT AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE FRONT DUE TO THE FRONT WINDOW FRAME BEING WIDE THE ADJUSTABLE SEAT AND RILT STEERING WHEEL HELP WITH OTHER VISUAL ISSUES 
I AM SHORT AND LIVE IN PHOENIX WHEN HEADING WEST AT SUNSET VISOR DOES NOT COME DOWN FAR ENOUGH TO BLOCK SUN 
I AM SHORT AND LOOKING OUT BACK IS DIFFICULT SO I JUST DRIVE AND WATCH MY SIDE MIRRORS FOR THE YELLOW WARNING LIGHT IF NOT FLASHING I CHANGE LANES IF IT LIGHTS UP I JUST STAY WHERE I AM!!
I AM SHORT AND OFTEN HAVE VISIBILITY ISSUES IN OTHER VEHICLES THE SEATS ADJUST SO I CAN REALLY SEE WELL THE BACK UP CAMERA IS REALLY FABULOUS GIVING A VERY WIDE VIEW BEHIND MY VEHICLE THE SIDES MIRRORS ARE VERY EASY TO SEE AND THE BLIND SPOT 
I AM SHORT AND SEAT CAN NOT BE RAISED EXACTLY AS HIGH AS I WOULD LIKE HOWEVER THE WIND SHIELD IS LARGE AND GOOD
I AM SHORT AND SOMETIMES I FEEL THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE IN MY WAY I HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK WHEN TURNING CORNERS

I AM SHORT AND THE DRIVER SEAT DOESN T ALLOW ME TO GO HIGH ENOUGH TO SEE OUT IN FRONT OF THE HOOD ALSO THE BACK WINDOWS ARE HARD TO SEE OUT OF 
I AM SHORT AND THE SUN VISOR DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK FOR ME ALSO I DO NOT LIKE THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THERE ARE TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS DO NOT LIKE THE DESIGN OF THE SIDE MIRRORS NOT EFFECTIVE FOR ME 
I AM SHORT AND THE VISOR DOES NOT COME DOWN ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE SUN FROM GETTING IN MY EYES WILL NEED TO BUY AN EXTENSION OF SOME SORT
I AM SHORT AND THUS HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY WITH SEEING OUT THE REAR PASSENGER WINDOW THIS IS WHEN I AM BACKING UP MUST ROLL DOWN WINDOW AND STICK HEAD OUT BUT THAT IS DUE TO MY HEIGHT MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE 
I AM SHORT AND WOULD LIKE IT IF THE DRIVERS SEAT COULD ELEVATE JUST A HAIR MORE WOULD ENABLE ME TO SEE A BIT BETTER OVER THE SIDE MIRROR ON DRIVER S SIDE 
I AM SHORT BUT THE VISOR IS TOO SMALL FOR ME TO USE SOMETIMES
I AM SHORT I ALWAYS HAVE PROBLEMS SEEING AND THIS VEHICLE IS NO DIFFERENT REAR WINDOW IS SMALL YOU CAN T EVEN SEE A WHOLE VEHICLE BEHIND YOU I LIKE THAT HEADLIGHTS AUTOMATICALLY COME ON/OFF WHEN ENTERING VEHICLE BUT COULD REMAIN ON LONGER O 
I AM SHORT MAKING SUN VISORS TYPICALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE ACURA MDX HAD HALOGEN HEADLAMPS WHICH I DID LIKE MUCH MORE

I AM SHORT UNDER 5 1/2 THE FRONT SIDE MIRRORS AND WINSHIELD PANEL ARE VISION BLOCKERS FOR ME BUT I HAVE ADAPTED TO THAT

I AM SO PLEASED WITH MY MKC IT IS A PERFECT CHOICE FOR ME 
I AM SO UNHAPPY WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION NAV NO MATTER WHAT I ASK SHE CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IS FIND STARBUCKS ? IT IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING AND THE ONLY THING I WANTED A GREAT NAV SYSTEM!!!
I AM SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE STEREO SYSTEM 
I AM SOMEWHAT OLD SCHOOL AND HAVE NOT USED A LOT OF THE TECH FEATURES OF VEHICLE BUT WILL SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE GIVE IT A SHOT!
I AM STILL FINE TUNING THE AUDIO SYSTEM
I AM STILL GETTING USE TO CONTROL FEATURE LIKE THE CRUZ CONTROL AND I DO NOT USE THE MANUAL CONTROLS AND I FEEL THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL INTERFERS WITH THE VISABLITY OF THE WIPER CONTROLS
I AM STILL GETTING USED TO MY NEW CAR BUT VISIBILITY SEEMS TO BE VERY GOOD 
I AM STILL GETTING USED TO MY SYSTEM BUT I LOVE IT MY XM TRIAL RAN OUT AND MY RADIO DOESNT SOUND AS GOOD AS XM I LOVE TO BE ABLE TO PLUG MY MP3 PLAYER IN AND LISTEN TO IT I LIVE AND DRIVE IN NORTH GEORGIA IN THE MOUNTAINS SO MY RECEPTION IS NO 
I AM STILL GETTING USED TO THE VISIBILITY ON THE SIDES AND TOWARD THE REAR THE SIDE WINDOWS PROBABLY WORK FINE BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE AND I AM GOING THROUGH AN ADJUSTMENT PERIOD 
I AM STILL LEARNING ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF THE SYSTEM BUT WHAT I HAVE USED WORKS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL I AM STILL GETTING USED TO THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM I HAVE TO REMEMBER TO USE THE RIGHT WORDS 
I AM STILL LEARNING ALL THE NEW STUFF IN THIS CAR BUT HAVE LOVED IT SO FAR
I AM STILL LEARNING ALOT ABOUT THE CUE TECHNOLOGY BUT I AM VERY IMPRESSED
I AM STILL LEARNING HOW IT ALL WORKS AND MY SALESMAN WELCOMES ME IN TO LEARN MORE WHENEVER I NEED MORE INSTRUCTION 
I AM STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND OTHER FEATURES SO FAR EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WORKING AND I AM HAPPY WITH TEM 
I AM STILL LEARNING THE CAR I LIKE HAVING THE RADIO AND CD PLAYER
I AM STILL LEARNING THE SYSTEM BUT OFTEN THE VOICE ACTIVATED SYSTEM MISREADS WHAT I AM ASKING IT TO DO COULD BE ME I AM NOT SURE 
I AM STILL LEARNING THE SYSTEMS THE MANUAL IS CONFUSING SINCE THE CONTROLS CAN DIFFER FROM ONE TRIM PACKAGE TO THE NEXT THEY TRY TO HAVE THE INFO FOR ALL PACKAGES IN THE SAME MANUAL AND I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE PICTURES TO SEE WHICH APPLIES TO ME 
I AM STILL LEARNING TO USE THINGS LIKE VOICE COMMAND THE CAR NEEDS TO TRAIN ME BEFORE IT WILL WORK WELL 
I AM STILL NOT COMFORTABLE WITH BAR ON REAR WINDOW FEEL LIKE IT OBSCURS MY VIEW I JUST MAY NEED TO GET USED TO THAT 
I AM STILL READING THE MANUAL ON THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM I CONVINCED SIRRUS THAT I WANTED MORE THAN A THREE YEAR SUBSCRIPTION SINCE I KEEP CARS OR TRUCKS FOR AT LEAST 12 YEARS I GOT IT! I DRIVE WITH GLOVES AND THE TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS CONDUCT 
I AM STILL TRYING THE DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENTS TO GET THE FEATURES I LIKE I FIND IT SOMEWHAT CONFUSING USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COMPARED TO A GARMIN
I AM STILL TRYING TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH ALL OF THE SYSTEMS IT TAKES TIME 
I AM TALL AND A SENIOR CITIZEN SO I DO HAVE SOME PROBLEM GETTING IN AND OUT OF THE CAR
I AM TALL SO I RARELY USE THE SUN VISORS 
I AM TALL SO MY SEAT SITS BACK AS FAR AS IT CAN GO THE SUN VISOR NEEDS AN EXTENSION SO IT WILL COVER THE ENTIRE SIDE WINDOW AS IT IS NOW WHEN FULLY EXTENDED THE SUN IS STILL IN MY EYES 
I AM TALL WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS ADJUSTED FOR WHERE I LIKE IT IT BLOCKS MY VIEW OF SOME OF THE GAUGES 
I AM TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGED AND HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT HOW ALL OF THE OPTIONS WORK NOR HAVE I TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE SYNC MY RIDE APPOINTMENT
I AM TEMPTED TO TAKE THE BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS OUT THEY BLOCK REAR VISIBLITY 
I AM TERRY MOEN NOT ARTHUR AND RATHER SHORT MY LAST CHRYSLER HAD SUN VISORS THAT WERE ADJUSTABLE ON AN ANGLE AND THEN DOWN SO I COULD BLOCK OUT THE SUN CANNOT DO ON THIS CAR ON OLD CHRYSLER THERE WAS NO HUMP ON THE DASH AT THE STEERING WHEE 
I AM THRILLED WITH THIS CAR I FEEL VERY SAFE DRIVING IT 
I AM TOLD IT THAT IT CAN BE HARD TO HEAR ME OR THERE IS A LOT OF BACKGROUND NOISE WHEN MAKING HANDS FREE CALLS 
I AM TOLD THAT MY CALLS DO NOT COME IN SHARP OR CLEAR OFTEN DIFFICULT TO HEAR ME
I AM TOO SHORT FOR THE SUN VISORS TO BE TRULY EFFECTIVE SOMETIMES I ALSO WOULD LIKE IT IF THE SEAT BELT ADJUSTED JUST A BIT LOWER FOR A SHORT PERSON 
I AM TRULY AMAZED BY THE HANDLING OF THE VEHICLE ESPECIALLY BETWEEN 80 100 MPH ON THE HIGHWAY IT REALLY HOLDS THE ROAD AND FEELS SMOOTH IN A VERY WINDY AND HEAVY RAIN STORM I DROVE 80 MPH AND THE VAN FELT LIKE I WAS DRIVING WITHOUT ANY RAIN FAL 
I AM TRULY AMAZED BY THIS VEHICLES EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY AND FINE DETAILS THE INSTRUMENT GAUGES ARE VERY APPEALING AND EASY TO FIND THE INTERIOR IS WELL CRAFTED WITHOUT COMPLICATION THE QUIET INTERIOR IS ALSO A HUGE PLUS A VERY SMART CHOICE 
I AM TRULY DISAPPOINTED IN THE BLINDSPOT FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT AND RIGHT SIDE OF VEHICLE
I AM TRULY DISAPPOINTED IN THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE NEW ACCORD IF I COULD TAKE BACK MY 2008 TRADE IN I WOULD IN A HEART BEAT THIS IS MY 4TH HONDA ACCORD IN A ROW AND ONLY PURCHASE I HAVE EVER BEEN UNHAPPY WITH 
I AM TRYING TO DO A FREAKING SURVEY NOT WRITE A BOOK
I AM UNABLE TO USE BLUETOOTH AUDIO WHEN THERE IS AN IPOD CONNECTED VIA USB I WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS NORMAL FOR THE CURRENT PORSCHE COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE 
I AM UNABLE TO USE MY PHONES HANDS FREE FEATURES SIRI THOUGH THE CARS SYSTEM WHICH I WAS ABLE TO DO JUST FINE IN MY 2009 A4 
I AM UNABLE TO USE MY VOICE RECOGNITION BECAUSE I WOULD NEED TO LOAD ALL THE CONTACTS INDIVIDUALLY AND IT IS WAY TOO TIME CONSUMING ALSO THE VOICE REGOGNITION MISINTERPRETED EVERYTIME I TRIED TO LOAD A CONTACT SO I JUST GAVE UP ON IT 
I AM UNCOMFORTABLE HAVING AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL MAYBE IT S JUST A MATTER OF GETTING USED TO IT SINCE I VE NEVER BEFORE OWNED A VEHICLE SO EQUIPPED IN ANY CASE I USUALLY DON T LISTEN TO ANY AUDIO AT ALL WHEN I M DRIVING SO I C 
I AM UPSET CD PLAYER ARE NOT INSTALLED IN 2015 SOULS I USE MINE
I AM UPSET THERE IS NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT I LOVE THE CONTROLS ON THE WHEEL 
I AM USE TO LARGER WINDOWS I HAD A 1999 CHEVY VAN IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE NEWER VEHICLES WOULD HAVE LARGER WINDOWS THE GRAND CHEROKEE ACTUALLY HAD MORE WINDOW SPACE THAN SOME OF THE OTHER VEHICLES I TEST DROVE BUT THEY COULD STILL BE BIGGER 
I AM USED TO A MINIVAN BEING ABLE TO SEE EVERYTHING 
I AM USED TO DRIVING A 2 DOOR WHICH ALLOW FOR A MUCH BETTER VIEW OF LOOKING TO THE RIGHT FOR ONCOMING VEHICLES WHEN TURNING THE 4 DOOR BLOCKS THE EASE OF VIEWING ESPECIALLY FOR THE RIGHT SIDE 
I AM USED TO DRIVING A SMALLER CAR TOYOTA ECHO AND I HAVE NOT BEEN DRIVING THE PRIUS MUCH DURING THE WINTER I HAVE ONLY PUT ABOUT 150 MILES ON THE PRIUS I LOVE IT SO FAR AND I BELIEVE THE MORE I DRIVE IT THE MORE COMFORTABLE I WILL BE WITH 
I AM USED TO DRIVING MY PRIUS BECAUSE I HAD MY LAST ONE FOR 5 YEARS THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS 
I AM USED TO DRIVING SUVS THIS IS MY VERY FIRST CAR THAT ISN T AND SUV SO THERE IS SOME CHALLENGE IN SEEING THE BLIND SPOT ON THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE DUE TO THE SMALL REAR WINDOW BUT OVERALL IT S GOT GREAT VISIBILITY I CHOSE THIS CAR BECAUSE I 
I AM USED TO NOT HAVING ALL OF THE BELLS AND WHISTLES THAT IT HAS AND NOW THAT I HAVE THEM I LOVE IT 
I AM USED TO THE OUTBACK WHICH HAS LARGER WINDOWS I FIND THAT THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOTS AND I REALLY HAVE TO USE MY MIRRORS AND LOOK FOR CHANGING LANES 
I AM USED TO THE SYSTEM AS I HAVE BEEN DRIVING NISSAN INFINITY FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS NOW 
I AM USING ON STAR AND SIRIUS ONLY DURING THE FREE MONTHS OTHERWISE I USE AM TALK RADIO AND FM MUSIC THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE GREAT EASY TO USE TO CHANGE THE STATION AND CONTROL THE VOLUME I DO NOT USE MANY OF THE COMMUNICATION DEVICE 
I AM USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO BECOME MORE FAMILAR WITH IT 
I AM VERY BOTHERED BY THE REFLECTED GLARE ON THE WINDSHIELD IT IS DANGEROUS 
I AM VERY COMFORTABLE CHANGING LANES BECAUSE OF THE WARNING SYSTEMS
I AM VERY COMFORTABLE USING THESE SYSTEMS 
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT I CANNOT UPGRADE MY HONDALINK TO THE NEXT GEN VERSION FROM THE FIRST GENERATION EPIC FAIL TO ME 
I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED THE BMW HAS NOT FOLLOWED THE PATH OF SOME OF THE JAPANESE AUTO MANUFACTURES AND SEEM TO BE WAY BEHIND IN ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGIES EXAMPLE BMW LISTS THE ONLY WAY TO SYNC AND RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES ON YOUR DISPLAY IS USING A B 
I AM VERY DISSAPPOINTED THAT THE VEHICAL DOES NOT CAME WITH STANDARD CD PLAYERS I LISTEN TO AUDIO BOOKS WHEN I DRIVE AND NOT HAVING A CD PLAYER MEANS THAT I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD TO A ZIP DRIVE HARD TO USE IN VEHICAL AND MORE TIME CONSUMING 
I AM VERY HAPPY THAT COLLISION AVOIDANCE LANE DEPARTURE AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DRIVING AIDS ARE OPTIONAL ON THIS VEHICLE I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THESE FEATURES 
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH ALL OF THE VEHICLES COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE INTEGRATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND I AM GLAD I GOT IT I AM ALSO VERY HAPPY WITH THE UCONNECT SYSTEM AND HOW IT WORKS WITH MY SMART PHONE 
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE VEHICLES VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY FEATURES ONE OF THE REASONS I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE WAS FOR THE REAR CAMERA WHEN BACKING UP 
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING SWITCHING LANES AND OVERALL WHILE DRIVING ON THE CRAZY FREEWAYS IN LOS ANGLES 
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE VISION TO ALL PARTS OF THE VEHICLE WHEN I AM DRIVING INCLUDING INSIDE AND OUTSIDE

I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH MY NEW CAR IT HANDLES WELL AND I FEEL SAFE WHILE DRIVING IT

I AMN VERY SHORT AND THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR AN X5 SUN VISORS I AM SHORT SO IN A DEAD ON SUN DAY THEY ARE IRRELEVENT 
I AND THE DRIVER OF ANOTHER CARD WERE SAVED FROM HARM NEITHER CAR WITH A SCRATCH THANKS TO THE CC S BRAKING SYSTEM IT SAVED US FROM A REALLY BAD ACCIDENT! I WOULD SAY HOWEVER THAT SOMETIMES THE BREAKS ARE A LITTLE TOO PASSIVE AND ONE MUST R 
I APPRECIATE ALL THE SAFETY FEATURES 
I APPRECIATE HAVING BLUETOOTH IN THE CAR SO THAT I M ABLE TO SAFELY MAKE/RECEIVE CALLS ON THE ROAD 
I APPRECIATE THAT THE SYSTEM ALLOWS ME TO OVERRIDE THE LOCKOUT AND ENTER DATA IT PROVIDES A WARNING TO USE THE SYSTEMS SAFELY IN CONSIDERATION OF TRAFFIC BUT DOESN T PREVENT USE WHEN IN MOTION THIS IS PARTICULARLY HELPFUL ON A TRIP WHEN MY PA 
I APPRECIATE THAT THE VISORS EXTEND TO COVER THE SIDE WINDOW 
I APPRECIATE THE 36 FAVORITE STATIONS THAT CAN BE PROGRAMMED INTO THE RADIO SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS ME TO INPUT EVERY STATION THAT I LISTEN TO THE DISPLAY IS EASY TO READ AND I CAN SWITCH BETWEEN MY PRESET STATIONS WITH A MINIMUM OF EFFORT I WILL CH 
I APPRECIATE THE BACK UP CAMERA 
I APPRECIATE THE BACK UP CAMERA AS AN ADDED SAFETY FEATURE
I APPRECIATE THE CONVENIENCE OF OWNING A LARGER VEHICLE THAT PROVIDES THE SAME FEEL AND COMFORT I HAD WHEN I DROVE THE 5 PASSENGER SUV I OWNED PREVIOUSLY MY TRAVERSE ANSWERED THE SPACE ISSUE I HAD WITHOUT MAKING ME FEEL LIKE I HAD TO UPGRADE TO 
I APPRECIATE THE EXCELLENT QUALITY OF THE SOUND IN A SHORT TIME I HAVE BECOME VERY DEPENDENT ON THE MUSIC AND PHONE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL GREAT FEATURES!
I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE DEALER REPRESENTATIVE SET UP AND DESCRIBED ALL OF THE FEATURES THAT THE CAR PROVIDES I HAVE NOT TAKEN THE TIME TO PLAY WITH EVERYTHING YET BUT IT S NICE TO KNOW THAT IT IS READY WHEN I DO 
I APPRECIATE THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTIVITY I FEEL SO MUCH SAFER THE AUTO TEXT MESSAGES ARE ALSO A NICE FEATURE 
I APPRECIATE THE HANDSFREE MOBILE PHONE AND THE ABILITY TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND FOR CALLING 
I APPRECIATE THE LARGER SCREEN WHICH MAKES THE SELECTIONS AND THE MAPS EASIER TO SEE QUICKLY 
I APPRECIATE THE REAR SENSORS ON MY CAR I WISH MY MKZ HAD FRONT SENSORS SINCE IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE HOW CLOSE ONE IS TO A GARAGE DOOR FOR EXAMPLE 
I APPRECIATE THE SAFETY FEATURES OF THE VEHICLE I WOULD PREFER THAT THE VIDEO SCREENS BE LOCATED IN THE HEAD RESTS RATHER THAN THE CEILING YOU CANNOT SEE IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN THE VIDEO SCREEN IS DOWN PERHAPS THAT COULD BE A DESIGN CHANG 
I APPRECIATE THE SAFETY FEATURES SUCH AS LANE CHANGE VEHICLES ALONGSIDE TOO CLOSE A VOICE WARNING OF APPROACHING PROBLEMS BACK UP PICTURES 
I APPRECIATE THE VOICE CONTROLS ALTHOUGH I AM EXPERIENCING SOME PROBLEMS WITH THEM I THINK IT S JUST THAT I HAVEN T LEARNED HOW TO USE THEM EFFECTIVELY PLUS I HAVE A SOFT VOICE THAT QUITE OFTEN THE SYSTEM DOESN T PICK UP I NEED TO TALK LOUDER!
I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH HAVING AMBER TURN SIGNAL LIGHTS VS RED ONES WHICH CAN BE HARDER TO NOTICE NEXT TO RED TAILLIGHTS 
I APPRECIATED THE DUAL SUNVISOR SYSTEM IN MY CAYENNE S THIS CAR SHOULD HAVE THE SAME SET UP 
I APPRECIATED THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC REPORTING TRAFFIC SUCKS BUT BEING ABLE TO KNOW AND VIEW THE VOLUME AHEAD BRINGS A PIECE OF MIND TO A DRIVE/COMMUTE KNOWING THE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS ALLOWS FOR A BETTER MINDSET WHICH TRANSLATES TO OVERALL POSITIV 
I ATE THAT THERE IS WATER LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD WHEN USING WIPERS AND ESPECIALLY AFTER USING WASHERS 
I AVOID USING THE TOUCH SCREEN WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE IT IS A BIG DISTRACTION 
I BACKED INTO MY HUSBAND S NEW TRUCK WHEN COMING OUT OF MY GARAGE HE WAS PARKED TO THE SIDE AND I WAS JUST NOT USED TO THE CAMERA I DIDN T EVEN HAVE THE TEMPORARY LICENSE PLATE OFF MY VEHICLE YET I AM GETTING MORE USED TO THE CAMERA BUT I 
I BECOME ONE WITH THE MACHINE
I BELIEVE A REAR CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT ON ALL CARS AND TRUCKS 
I BELIEVE BLIND SIDE MONITORING SHOULD BE STANDARD IT IS ONE OF THE FEATURES I MISS THE MOST IN THE VAN HAD I KNOWN THEY DIDN T HAVE IT I MIGHT NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS ONE 
I BELIEVE BOSE IS ONE OF THE BEST AUTO AUDIO MAKERS MOST OTHERS DO NOT PROVIDE CRISP CLEAR SOUND
I BELIEVE I HAVE GOOD ALL AROUND VISIBILITY I FEEL EVEN MORE SECURE WITH THE LANE CHANGING ALERT WARNING SENSORS AND THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE MONITORS WILL THERE BE A ROAD HAZARD DETECTION WARNING SENSOR IN FUTURE MODELS? IF SO I WOULD LIKE TO H 
I BELIEVE IF THE VEHICLES OUTSIDE MIRRORS WERE MOUNTED OUT ON THE FRONT FENDERS APPROXIMATELY IN LINE WITH THE FRONT OF THE FRONT WHEELS FROM THIS ANGLE THE BLIND SPOT IS NEARLY ELIMINATED 100% NEEDS BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM BACK UP CAMERA IS AL 
I BELIEVE IT HAS FEWER BLIND SPOTS THAT ANY OTHER CAR I VE OWNED GOOD WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT AND MAKING A SHARP TURN SUCH AS INTO MY DRIVEWAY THE AREA BEING APPROACHED IS VERY POORLY LIT BAD 
I BELIEVE SUN VISOR SHOULD BE MADE TO ADJUST TO DRIVER S LEFT SIDE TO AVOID SUN
I BELIEVE THAT ALL CARS SHOULD HAVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING
I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NOT SPENT ENOUGH TIME FIGURING OUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS I HAVE NOT BEEN DRIVING THE CAR VERY LONG THE TWO TIMES I TRIED TO USE IT I ENDED UP CALLING ONSTAR I DO NOT HAVE A SMART PHONE SO I HAVE NOT TRIED THOSE FEATURES 
I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU PUT A SYSTEM IN IT SHOULD BE COMPLETE
I BELIEVE THAT STRUCTURAL STRENGTH PROVIDED BY THE THICK BEAMS SUPPORTING THE ROOF IS OF VALUE IT S EITHER MORE GLASS AND LESS STRENGTH OR LESS GLASS AND THICKER BEAMS SUPPORT OF ROOF ESPECIALLY DURING A ROLL OVER USE OF SIDE AND REAR MIRRORS 
I BELIEVE THAT THE DISCOVER PRO 8 SCREEN WOULD HAVE FIT VERY NICELY INSIDE OF THE CABIN OF THE 2015 GTI HOWEVER IT S A MINOR GRIPE AND OVERALL THE MMI/AUDIO SYSTEM IS EXCEPTIONAL 
I BELIEVE THAT THE FRONT AND BACK BLIND SPOTS WHILE DRIVING AND/OR PASSING COULD BE IMPROVED WITH A SLIGHT DESIGN IMPROVEMENT 
I BELIEVE THAT THE SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER MORE OUTPUT ETC 
I BELIEVE THAT THE SUN ROOF IS RELATIVELY SMALL FOR THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE AND GIVEN THE PRICE THE ROOF SHADE SHOULD OPEN/CLOSE BY POWER THE CONTROL FOR THE ROOF SHOULD BE PUSH BUTTON 
I BELIEVE THE BACK UP CROSS TRAFFIC WARNING LIGHT HELPED TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT 
I BELIEVE THE CAR SHOULD HAVE REAR WIPERS/WASHERS
I BELIEVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE A LOT BETTER! IT HAS BEEN INACCURATE AND IS NOT USER FRIENDLY ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING THE OLDER BMWS USED TO HAVE A SPLIT SCREEN WHERE YOU COULD HAVE THE MAP DISPLAYED AND THEN SPLIT TO HAVE THE ACTUAL DIR 
I BELIEVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD DEFAULT TO A LARGER GEOGRAPHICAL AREA I FIND THE STANDARD DEFAULT LIMITING 
I BELIEVE THE SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD BE LARGER AND HAVE LARGER DUAL MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE THE TINY LITTLE CONVEX MIRROR IMPOSED ON THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR IS TOO SMALL TO BE EFFECTIVE I LIKE A LARGER SIDE MIRROR LIKE THE FORD S I AM WONDERING 
I BELIEVE THE SOUND SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED WITH A BETTER SYSTEM
I BELIEVE THE SPEAKER SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED IT IS NOT AS CLEAR AS IT COULD BE I STILL FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM A BIT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE NOT EASY TO GO BACK 
I BELIEVE THE SYSTEMS ARE PROBABLY FINE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME EDUCATION BY THE DEALERSHIP TO FAMILIARIZE THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY 
I BELIEVE THE WAY MY LEGACY IS EQUIPPED IT IS THE SAFEST CAR ON THE ROAD 
I BELIEVE THERE IS MORE OF A BLIND SPOT IN THIS VEHICLE COMPARED TO MY 2006 HYUNDAI TUCSON I BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE THE SIDE GLASSES ARE SMALLER 
I BELIEVE WHEN I DID A TEST DRIVE THE 2015 PILOT I DROVE HAD AN EXTENDED VISOR DISAPPOINTING IT WASN T IN THE ONE I PURCHASED 
I BOUGHT A CONVERTIBLE & DRIVE WITH THE TOP DOWN UNLESS IT S RAINING SO I DON T USE MOST OF THESE FEATURES

I CAN SAY THAT I LOVE ALPINE AND YOU PICK THE RIGHT SURROUND SYSTEM FOR THIS VEHICLE 
I CAN SEE ALL AROUND ME MUCH BETTER THAN MY LAST 2 NEW CARS THE BIG WINDSHIELD IS GREAT AND THE FRONT DOORS ARE LONG ENOUGH THAT THERE IS LOTS OF VISIBILITY THROUGH THE SIDE WINDOWS 
I CAN SEE ALRIGHT TOWARDS THE BACK AND SIDES BUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR DOES COME IN HANDY EVEN MORE SO THE REAR CROSS PATH DETECTION HAS COME IN HANDY A NUMBER OF TIMES WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACES PARTICULARLY WHEN SURROUNDED BY TALL S

I CAN STREAM FROM MY WINDOWS PHONE USING BLUETOOTH 
I CAN SWITCH AROUND AND PLAY THE RADIO THEN A CD THEN MY IPAD THEN MY PHONE 
I CAN SWITCH FROM RADIO TO CD TO I POD IN SECONDS WITH OUT TAKING MY EYES OFF THE ROAD 
I CAN T ADVISE HOW I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS CHANGED BUT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN MY VISION OF CARS PEOPLE ETC HAS BEEN OBSCURED BY THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR AND DOOR/WINDOW EDGE THE MIRROR IS LARGE ENOUGH TO CREATE A BLIND SPOT TO PERIPHIA 
I CAN T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND CONVERSATIONS ON THE PHONE

I CAN T SEE OUT MY BACK WINDOW AND THAT S REASON ENOUGH FOR ME NOT TO RECOMMEND THE CAR TO ANYONE IT IS SLANTED UPWARD WAY TOO MUCH THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A NICE ADDITIONAL FEATURE BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON IT 
I CAN T SEE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW AT ALL THANK YOU FOR THE CAMERAS!
I CAN T SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW USING THE REARVIEW MIRROR VERY WELL I AM ONLY ABLE TO SEE A COUPLE YARDS BEHIND THE VEHICLE IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE VERY FAR OUT OF IT ALSO THE BLIND SPOT IS HUGE IN MY OPINION AND I M NEVER QUITE SURE HOW SAF 
I CAN T SEE THE FRONT OF MY HOOD SO HARD TO GAUGE DISTANCE ALSO WITH THE LINE IN THE REAR VISIBILITY THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DESIGN QUESTION FOR ME? WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A LINE/BAR IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR REAR VISIBILITY?
I CAN T SEE THE HOOD OF THE CAR VERY WELL WHEN DRIVING THIS MAKES IT HARD TO TELL IF YOU HAVE PULLED FORWARD FAR ENOUGH INTO A PARING SPOT AS A RESULT I HAVE HAD TO RE PARK THE CAR SEVERAL TIMES WHEN IT WAS STICKING OUT TOO FAR IN A SPACE I AM 
I CAN T SEE WHERE THE FRONT OF THE HOOD ENDS 
I CAN T SEEM TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT AUDIO DEVICE I E I D LIKE TO HAVE IT DEFAULT TO MY PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH BUT I CAN T SEEM TO GET IT TO DO THAT IT WILL DEFAULT TO THE LAST ITEM USED FOR AM OR FM RADIOS BUT NOT SATELLITE 
I CAN T SEEM TO GET SPEAKERS TO GIVE REALLY GOOD SOUND
I CAN T SEEM TO GET THE HANG OF THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR 
I CAN T SEEM TO SHUT OFF THE SCREEN
I CAN T SING THE PRAISES OF EYESIGHT ENOUGH IT S THE REASON I BOUGHT THE CAR AND IT HAS NOT DISAPPOINTED I CAN T IMAGINE OWNING ANOTHER DAILY VEHICLE WITHOUT THAT EXTRA SET OF SENSORS KEEPING AN EYE ON THINGS FOR ME I VE NEVER FELT SAFER ON CRO 
I CAN T TELL WHERE THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE IS THE HOOD SLOPES DOWN AND OUT OF SIGHT 
I CAN T THINK OF ANY 
I CAN T USE BLUETOOTH FOR MY AUDIO MP3 NOW WHICH WAS A HUGE FEATURE FOR ME AND PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ISSUE WITH VOICE COMMAND AND NAVIGATION 
I CAN T USE CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL TO GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN TWO STATIONS
I CAN T USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION AT ALL IT KEEPS ASKING ME TO REPEAT MYSELF THE NAVIGATION IS GREAT BUT AT TIMES HARD TO USE 
I CAN TALK AND DRIVE WITH MY HANDS ON THE STEERING WHEEL!
I CAN TALK HANDS FREE ON THE PHONE WHILE DRIVING
I CAN TALK ON THEPHONE WITHOUT USING MY HANDS 
I CAN TALK USING MY BLUETOOTH AND STILL GET MY NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS ALSO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC AND STILL GET DIRECTIONS FROM THE NAV SYSTEM

I CAN VERBALLY ENTER A DESTINATION IN THE NAV SYSTEM AND IT UNDERSTAND ME EVERY TIME 
I CANNOT ADJUST THE DRIVER SEAT AS HIGH AS I WOULD LIKE I LIKE THE CAMERAS BUT DON T COMPLETELY TRUST THE ACCURACY ON BACKING UP/OUT 
I CANNOT ALWAYS GET THE VOICE COMMAND TO MAKE MY PHONE CALL BY USING THE FUNCTION ON STEERING WHEEL I PRESS ON IT AND GET THE VOICE COMMAND AND TELL IT WHO TO CALL AND IT REPEATS THAT BUT THEN THE CALL DOES NOT GO THROUGH VERY FRUSTRATING ALSO 
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT I BOUGHT A BRAND NEW VEHICLE THAT DOES NOT HAVE CAPABILITY TO USE XM/SIRIUS I M TOLD THE DEALER HAS TO INSTALL SOMETHING THIS IS UNSATISFACTORY 
I CANNOT CONNECT MY TABLET TO SYNC
I CANNOT CONNECT TO INTERNET ISSUE WITH CONNECTIVITY 
I CANNOT CONTROL WHICH SPEAKERS THE SOUND IS COMING FROM IT DOES NOT SOUND QUITE STEREO FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT AND I CAN T ADJUST THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DIRECT SOUND ONLY TO THE FRONT SPEAKERS OR ONLY TO THE BACK SPEAKERS IT IS FRUSTRAT 
I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE FAVORITE BUTTONS TO A DIFFERENT STATION 
I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP THE RADIO ON AFTER I SHUT THE CAR OFF AND UNTIL I OPEN THE DOOR I THOUGHT THIS WAS AVAILABLE BUT I CAN T DO IT ANYMORE 
I CANNOT FIND ANYTHING BAD ABOUT EITHER 
I CANNOT GET MY PHONE TO CONNECT VIA THE NISSANCONNECT APP WHICH IS ANNOYING 
I CANNOT GET USE TO THE LIMITED VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING DIRECTLY OUT THE REAR WINDOW OR VIA THE REARVIEW MIRROR THE BACK DASH IS SO HIGH I CANT T SEE CARS BEHIND ME IF THEY ARE FOLLOWING CLOSE I ALSO CAN T SEEM TO GET THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS ADJU 
I CANNOT READ ANY INFORMATION ON THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IN A BRIGHT DAY THE DISPLAY TO RED AND TOO SMALL 
I CANNOT RELY ON THE USE OF THE MIRRORS THE BLIND SPOT IS QUITE ACUTE AND I WOULD HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF NEAR MISSES IF I HAD NOT LOOKED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER 
I CANNOT REPLY BECAUSE I RARELY USE THESE FEATURES 
I CANNOT SEE AROUND THE HEADRESTS ON THE BACK SEATS IF THEY ARE EXTENDED 
I CANNOT SEE THE FRONT END OF THE CAR AS FRONT PARKING SENSORS WERE NOT AN OPTION I HAD THEM INSTALLED AFTER MARKET SO I CAN PARK IN TIGHT CITY SPOTS 
I CANNOT SEE THE FRONT OF THE CAR HOOD WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT IN NEGOTIATING TURNS OR PASSING
I CANNOT SEE THE FRONT OR BACK ENDS DUE TO THE SLOPE OF THE HOOD AND TRUCK I WOULD RATHER KNOW WHERE THEY ARE 
I CANNOT SEE THE FRONT OR REAR END OF THE VEHICLE I WOULD BE IN A VERY BAD POSITION WITHOUT THE CAMERAS WHICH I HAVE NOW BECOME DEPENDENT ON 
I CANNOT SET STATIONS EASILY TOO CONFUSING I LOVE TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO WHILE DRIVING AND DO NOT BECAUSE I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO SELECT A STATION WHILE DRIVING 
I CANNOT STREAM AUDIO VIA BLUETOOTH OR CHANGE PROGRAMED RADIO STARTIONS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL
I CANNOT TELL IF THE AUTODIMMING MIRRORS MAKE A DIFFERENCE DOES NOT SEEM LIKE THEY DO ANYTHING 
I CANNOT USE THE BLUETOOTH BECAUSE OTHERS CANNOT HEAR ME 
I CANNOT USE THE NAVIGATION BECAUSE AS PREVIOUSLY INDICATED I CANNOT SEEM TO ENTER THE REQUIRED DOSA HOME ADDRESS TO EVEN GET STARTED IT MAY BE JUST MEN 
I CANNOT USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY IPHONE 
I CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE ENTERTAINMENT APPLICATIONS AND SOUND QUALITY ON BLUE TOOTH IS POOR 
I CANT SEEM TO ACTIVATE BLUE TOOTH FROM TOUCH SCREEN OR BUTTON ON STEERING WHEEL EVEN THOUGH MY PHONE IS READY FOR SIGNAL I WILL READ BOOK BUT HAVEN T TAKEN THE TIME YET I WISH IT WAS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND 
I CANT SWITCH OVER TO GET A SECOND CALL
I CANT THINK OF ANYTHING THAT COULD IMPROVE SYSTEM 
I CANT THINK OF ONE ITS GOOD
I CAR DRIVES SOLIDLY I LOVE THE EXTRA SUNSCREENS ON THE 2ND AND 3RD ROW WINDOWS!
I CERTAINLY FEEL SAFER DRIVING A MODERN LEXUS LOTS OF THOUGHT AND TESTING FOR SAFETY 
I CHECKED OUT A LEXUS PRIOR TO THIS PURCHASE AND EVEN THOUGH THE LEXUS MIGHT OF HAD MORE FEATURES THE INTERIOR HAD TO MUCH PLASTIC COMPARED TO THE INFINITI THIS WAS MY 1ST CHOICE SO I WENT WITH THE INFINITI AGAIN 
I CHOSE THE MOST BASIC PACKAGE WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE THE UPGRADED ELS AUDIO SYSTEM THE STANDARD AUDIO SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM VERY POWERFUL OR IMMERSE YOU IN SURROUND SOUND LIKE OTHER AUDIO SYSTEMS ON THE MARKET SEEM TO DO I SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED U 
I CHOSE THE Q5 SPECIFICALLY FOR BETTER VISIBILITY AND SO FAR IT HAS PROVIDED THAT IN MULTIPLE WAYS 
I CHOSE THE SEQUOIA OVER A TAHOE BECAUSE OF THE GREAT VISIBILITY I FEEL SAFER IN THIS CAR 
I CHOSE THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE IT WAS A PERFECT FIT 
I CHOSE THIS VEHICLE MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY IT PROVIDED FOR A SPORTY LUXURY TYPE VEHICLE 
I CLEAR WELL LITT AND EASY TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND
I COMPARED THIS SYSTEM TO THE AUDI WHEN BUYING NEW CAR AND THIS WAS MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE AND EASY TO FIGURE OUT 
I CON NOT EXPLAIN IT IS JUST SO EASY TO USE IT PRETTY MUCH DOES ALL THE WORK FOR YOU
I CONNECTS EASILY WITH MY PHONE THE SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT I CAN LISTEN MUSIC FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES 
I CONSIDER THE TRACK S BACK AND FORWARD STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS QUITE USEFUL THE SCROLL DEVICE THAT REPLACED THEM IS USEFUL BUT DOESN T DO MUCH FOR THE DRIVER IF THE SHUFFLE OPTION IS ENABLED 
I CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING THE VOICE ACTIVATED SYSTEMS TO WORK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE HAD A LITTLE MORE INSTRUCTION FROM THE DEALER REGARDING THE USE OF THE HANDS FREE SYSTEMS 
I CORRECTED NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT BY TAKING OUT THE BACK HEADRESTS 
I COULD HAVE UPGRADED TO A BETTER SOUND SYSTEM BUT THOUGHT THE AUDIO QUALITY WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER WITHOUT HAVING TO SPRING FOR A BOSE SYSTEM THE CLARITY IN THE SOUND IS MISSING AND THE BALANCE SEEMS OFF NOT SURE HOW THE SPEAKERS ARE S 
I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH MY VOLVO I HAVE BEEN BUYING VOLVOS FOR 30 YEARS 
I COULD NOT FIND A WAY TO LOAD PLAY LISTS OR MAKE PLAY LISTS ON THE HARD DISK DRIVE 
I COULD NOT HOOK UP MY DAUGHTERS IPOD
I COULD NOT SEE A VEHICLE THAT WAS IN THE LANE NEXT TO ME WHEN DRIVING NEITHER IN MY SIDE VIEW MIRROR OR THE REAR VIEW MIRROR HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT I SAW HIM COME FROM BEHIND HAS BLIND SPOTS THAT ARE DANGEROUS!
I COULD TELL YOU MORE IF IT ACTUALLY WORKED 
I COULD USE ANOTHER LESSON ON USING THE SYSTEM I DON T THINK I M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EVERYTHING IT OFFERS 
I COULDN T ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE FOR SAFETY IN A CAR
I CRASHED MY BMW 5 SERIES INTO A TRUCK THE ILLEGALLY TURNED LEFT IN FRONT OF ME IT SAVED MY LIFE AND I AM FOREVER LOYAL
I CURBED MY PASSENGER RIM AND WISH THE SENSOR COULD OF DETECTED IT 
I CURRENTLY HAVE HUNDREDS OF SONGS ON MY PHONE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY PLAY ARTIST  AND IT PLAYS FROM MY PHONE CURRENTLY ONLY ABLE TO DO THIS IF I HAVE A DEDICATED USB DRIVE ON THE SYSTEM 
I D HAVE BOUGHT THE NAV SYSTEM IF IT WAS AS EASY AND CHEAP TO UPGRADE AS MY GARMIN UNIT ALL CARS SHOULD HAVE A NAV UNIT BUILT IN AND SHOULD BE UPGRADABLE VIA A DOWNLOAD FROM THE INTERNET ONTO A THUMB DRIVE FOR UPDATING 
I D HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE TWO ASPECTS THAT I LIKE THE MOST 1 THE EASE OF USE AND 2 THE QUALITY OF SOUND 
I D LIKE A CHOICE TO HAVE THE TECHIE STUFF IN MY CAR OR NOT 
I D LIKE A DRIVER S SIDE REAR CAMERA
I D LIKE A LARGER COLOR DISPLAY MONITOR WITH TOUCHSCREEN
I D LIKE A MORE POWERFUL SOUND SYSTEM 250 WATTS JUST ISN T ENOUGH 
I D LIKE BETTER/EASIER CONTROL IN FINDING THE MUSIC I WANT ON MY PHONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION USING THE TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS YOU HAVE TO SCROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN A LONG LIST OF ARTISTS TO FIND THE ONE YOU WANT AND THE SCROLL DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK 
I D LIKE IT BETTER IF I COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT THE MANUAL IS VERY CONFUSING 
I D LIKE THE DRIVER SEST TO ADJUST UP MORE 
I D LIKE THE PHONE APP TO HAVE ACCESS TO SYSTEM SETTINGS AND CONTROLS NO REASON YOU CAN T HAVE THE WHOLE INFO SYSTEM ON A SMARTPHONE REMOTELY FROM THE CAR 
I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE OVER THE FRONT OF THE CAR A BIT BETTER
I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE NAV WHILE DRIVING BUT I BELIEVE THAT S DUE TO A LAW 
I D LIKE TO HAVE A FRONT CAMERA FOR PARKING PURPOSES SIMILAR TO THE REAR VIEW CAMERA 
I D LIKE TO HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN ALSO I CAN T USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING EVEN IF A PASSENGER IS ENTERING THE INFORMATION I DON T KNOW HOW TO USE THE INTERNET WI FI IN THE CAR AND I M WAITING FOR MERCEDES TO RETURN MY CALL ON THE PAS 
I D LIKE TO HAVE AUTO ON HEADLIGHTS 
I D LIKE TO HAVE VOICE CONTROL FOR MUSIC PLAYED VIA BLUETOOTH OR USB 
I D LIKE TO SAY CARPLAY BUT IT S NOT AVAILABLE YET I DO LIKE THE SOUND IT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD 
I D LIKE TO SEE THE ADDITION OF WHITE HEADLIGHTS 
I D LIKE TO SEE THE CURRENT TRACK LISTED WHEN PULLING UP THE TRACK LIST I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO MORE QUICKLY LOCATE AN ARTIST OR TRACK NAME INSTEAD OF PAGING UP OR DOWN FROM THE ALPHABETICAL BEGINNING I M NOT CLEAR ON HOW TO MAKE AN ACCEPT 
I D LIKE TO SEE TRAILER TOWING MIRRORS THAT EXTEND AUTOMATICALLY AS WELL AS FOLD AND PERHAPS A BIT LARGER PERCENTAGE OF THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS COULD BE THE UPPER FLAT MAIN MIRROR WITH LESSER PERCENTAGE BEING THE CONVEX LOWER SECTION OF THE MIRROR 
I D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE IT I READ THE MANUAL AND PLAYED WITH IT BUT I STILL CAN T GET IT TO DO WHAT I D LIKE THE MANUAL SHOWS OR EXPLAINS THINGS THAT JUST AREN T ON MY CAR 
I D LIKE TO USE VOICE CONTROL BUT I DON T BECAUSE IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY DON T KNOW IF I TALK FUNNY OR SYSTEM CAN T DISCRIMINATE VERY WELL USING THE NAV WITHOUT VOICE TAKES TOO LONG TO DIAL IN THE INFO I DEFAULT TO GOOGLE MAPS ON MY 
I D LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL
I D LOVE A FULLY GLASS ROOF AND PERHAPS A SLIGHTLY EASIER REAR VIEW ON BLIND SPOTS 
I D LOVE FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO MEMORIZE MY PREFERRED ROUTES TO PLACES THAT I DON T GO TO VERY OFTEN IF I ONLY GO SOMEPLACE EVERY 6 MONTHS OR SO I M NOT GOING TO REMEMBER THE ROUTE BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE NAV SYSTEM WOULD RECOGNIZE 
I D PREFER A FULL TURN BY TURN LIST OPTION ALTHOUGH IT GIVES OPTION IT ONLY LISTS A FEW IN ADVANCE AS WITH MOST NAVIGATION SYSTEMS SOMETIMES THE ROUTE IT HAS CHOSEN INCLUDES STEPS THAT ORE NOT NECESSARY OR A ROUTE THAT DRIVER WOULD PREFER NOT T 
I D PREFER LARGER SIDE MIRRORS
I D RATHER USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN MY SMARTPHONE IT S ALWAYS UP TO DATE THE CARS SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY BECOME OUT OF DATE OVER TIME 
I DELIVER MEALS ON WHEELS AND HAVE A NEW ROUTE ALL THE TIME THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MAKES IT REALLY EASY TO USE 
I DEPEND AND APPRECIATE THE WARNING SIGNALS AS OFTEN IT IS HARD TO SEE UPCOMING TRAFFIC FROM THE SIDE 
I DEPEND HEAVILY ON THIS SYSTEM AND IT HASN T LET ME DOWN 
I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE PURCHASING THIS CAR AND MADE MY CHOICE BASED IN SOME PART ON WHAT EXCELLENT SAFETY RATINGS IT RECEIVED 
I DID ADD LITTLE ROUND MIRRORS ON MY SIDE MIRRORS AS THERE IS A SOME BLIND SPOT
I DID LIKE THE MUTE BUTTON ON MY 2013 THOSE BUTTONS WERE REARRANGED ON THE 15
I DID LIKE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BETTER ON MY EDGE THE MAP ON THIS ONE YOU ARE RIGHT ON TOP OF WHERE YOU ARE ON THE EDGE IT SHOWED MY ROAD BEFORE I GOT THERE 
I DID MY RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING MY TOYOTA I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE LARGE TRUNK THE SHELF UNDER THE CONSOLE AND THE GENERAL VISIBILITY FROM INSIDE THE CAR THE GAS MILAGE WAS ALSO A FACTOR IN MY SELECTION IN PURCHASING A TOYOTA PRIUS GOOD FACTORS 
I DID NOT BUY THE NAVIGATION FEATURE AND THEREFORE DO NOT HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION ON OTHER AUDI CARS YOU CAN HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION WITHOUT PURCHASING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE SALES PERSON WAS NOT AWARE THIS FUNCTION DID NOT WORK WITHOUT THE N 
I DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE CHANGING LANES SO I INSTALLED SOME CONVEX MIRRORS THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS HAMPERED BY THE POST BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR WINDOWS THE REAR WINDOW SEEMS SMALL 
I DID NOT GET NAVIGATION OR UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM SO SOUND IS A LITTLE MUFFLED
I DID NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH IN MY PREVIOUS AUTOMOBILE SO TO MAKE A CALL I HAD TO USE THE PHONE WITH AN EARPIECE I LOVE THAT I CAN CALL THE OFFICE AND GIVE THEM AN UPDATE AS I HAVE TO WORK OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE FROM TIME TO TIME 
I DID NOT HAVE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH UNTIL THIS CAR IT SEEMS HARDER FOR EACH PARTY IN THE CONVERSATION TO HEAR WHEN I USE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH 
I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO OPERATE THE SYSTEMS AT FIRST BUT ONCE I LEARNED HOW I CAN CONTROL EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON AND HOW SMOOTH THE TRANSITION IS I JUST LOVE IT 
I DID NOT KNOW I COULD USE VOICE COMMAND FOR HEATING CONTROLS AND RADIO??? REALLY? I LL HAVE TO CHECK THIS OUT 
I DID NOT OPT FOR THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM HOWEVER THE BOSE SYSTEM HAS A RICHER SOUND 
I DID NOT PURCHASE THE LIGHTING PACKAGE WITH MY GTI THE HEADLIGHTS ARE STILL EFFECTIVE BUT I FIND THAT VISIBILITY OF THE HALOGEN HEADLIGHTS IN MY OLDER JETTA APPEARS BETTER THEN THEM 
I DID NOT REALIZE THERE WAS NOT A CD PLAYER WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR I GUESS I JUST ASSUMED VERY DISAPPOINTED SINCE I LOVE TO LISTEN TO MY CD S
I DID NOT THINK THE SOUND WOULD SOUND SO CLEAR 
I DID NOT UNDERSTAND MANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS CONTROLS ARE HORRIBLE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SET TIME FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE PHONE ETC 
I DID NOTICE THE LAST TIME I USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I MADE AN INCORRECT TURN THE SYSTEM DID NOT RE ROUTE ME OR ANYTHING 
I DID TO HAVE SO MUCH FUN DRIVING A TRUCK/CAR AGIN AND I DRIVE FOR A LIVING !MY HOT CLUB FRIENDS LAFFED AT TILL I MADE THEM DRIVE MY LIL GREEN SOUL WE RED LIGHTED MY BUDYS 67 289CI MUSTANG N KICKED HIS ASS LOL
I DIDN T EVEN REALIZE IT WAS AN OPTION AT FIRST BUT THE CAR DETECTS WHEN I M TURNING LEFT OR RIGHT AND ADJUSTS THE HEADLIGHTS TOWARD THAT ANGLE THIS HAS GREATLY IMPROVED VISIBILITY GREAT FEATURE VW!
I DIDN T GET NAVIGATION WITH VEHICLE I CAN RECEIVE ROUTE ASSISTANCE THROUGH ONSTAR 
I DIDN T GET THE PASSING VEHICLE WARNING NOTICE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL HOWEVER I CAN SEE OUT OF ALL WINDOWS CLEARLY 
I DIDN T HAVE A CHANCE TO LISTEN TO A MARK LEVINSON STEREO SYSTEM IN A VEHICLE AS NONE WERE IN STOCK I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE MORE POWER CLEAR VOLUME FROM THE STEREO AND WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THE UPGRADE BUT IT IS A PRICEY OPTION TO CHOOSE WITH 
I DIDN T HAVE ONE IN MY OLD CAR SO ITS GREAT! VERY EASY TO USE AND REALLY NICE WHEN VISITING PLACES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO WITH ALL THE ONE WAY STREETS! OUR OTHER CAR IS A HYNDAI AND THE NAVIGATION HAS AN EXTREMELY LOUD ANNOYING BEEP AT EVERY TURN 
I DIDN T KNOW VOICE COMMANDS WOULD CONTROL A/C
I DIDN T LIST IT ON THE PREVIOUS SCREEN BUT THE NUMBER OF AIRBAGS FOR SUCH A SMALL CAR IS VERY IMPRESSIVE I FEEL THAT WERE I IN A COLLISION THEY WOULD FILL THE WHOLE CAR 
I DIDN T OPT FOR THE BLIND SPOT OPTION BUT THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS ON THE GS AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SMART MOVE PERHAPS MAKING THEM STANDARD WOULD BE A SMART WAY TO GO 
I DIDN T PAY FOR THE EXTRA ENTERTAINMENT PACKAGE AS I SOLELY USE MY APPLE MOBILE DEVICES FOR MUSIC AND AUDIO BOOKS BUT NOW I WISH I HAD I M NOT SURE IF IT WOULD HAVE IMPROVED THE CONTROLS BUT IT MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME MORE OPTIONS WHEN INTERFACING 
I DIDN T WANT AN ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM I JUST WANT A GOOD STEREO SYSTEM WITH CD PLAYER BUT IT IS NOT AVAILABLE 
I DIDNT EVEN KNOW I HAD VOICE RECOGNITION NAVIGATION NEEDS UPDATED MAPS SOMETIMES NAVIGATION TAKES YOU WAY OUT OF YOUR INTENDED DESTINATION
I DISLIKE HAVING THE PANELS INSTEAD OF WINDOWS ON THE BACK ENDS NOR THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE I WANTED WINDOWS ALL AROUND AS IS AVAILABLE IN THE PASSENGER MODEL BUT THE SALESMAN ADAMANTLY REFUSED TO ALLOW IT IN THE CARGO VERSION I AM A NERVO 
I DISLIKE HOW OFTEN THE CAMERA SYSTEM BEEPS TO TELL YOU OF A LANE DEPARTURE ESPECIALLY WHEN MERGING ONTO A FREEWAY I DON T LIKE THE RED LIGHT ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR INDICATING THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL I KNOW I CAN TURN IT OFF BUT IT SHOULD STAY 
I DISLIKE THAT THE SCREEN EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE 12 9 SCREEN ALWAYS CUTS OFF THE SONG TITLES I WISH IT WOULD DISPLAY THE WHOLE TITLE WITHIN REASON ALSO I WISH THAT WHEN MY IPOD IS SYNCED THROUGH BLUETOOTH THAT I STILL HAD ACCESS TO LOOK FO

I DO FIND AND FOUND THE SAME THING IN MY OLD 2003 GOLF THAT THE VERY LARGE SIDE BEAMS FLANKING THE FRONT WINDSHIELD LIMIT THE VISIBILITY OF PEDESTRIANS WHEN I AM AT AN INTERSECTION I HAVE TO CRANE MY NECK AROUND BOTH SIDES OF THIS BEAM BEFORE 
I DO FIND IT A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW SO THE BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL BUT I DON T KNOW IF ITS JUST BECAUSE I M SHORT OR THAT IT S BECAUSE I WAS USED TO THE CRV 
I DO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE THINGS TO THE SIDES OF ME IN THIS CAR I KEEP ADJUSTING MIRRORS THINKING I WILL FIND THE PERFECT PLACEMENT HOWEVER I THINK IT IS MORE RELATED TO THE DESIGN OF THE CAR I LOVE THE LOOK BUT I DO THINK IT IMPACTS 
I DO FIND THAT WHEN I AM CHANGING LANES THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE SIDES IS NOT GREAT AND FIND MYSELF RELYING ON THE CAR TO ALERT ME IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE OTHER LANE AS A CONFIRMATION I FEEL INCREDIBLY SAFE IN THE CAR WHICH IS THE MAIN REASON 
I DO FIND THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE ON THE SMALL SIDE

I EXPECT MORE FROM A HONDA DESIGN WHICH HAS HAD DECADES TO IMPROVE THEIR DESIGN FEEL FREE TO CALL ME IF YOU ARE TRULY INTERESTED 310 350 3978
I EXPECT MUCH MORE RESPONSIVENESS OF TOUCH SCREEN SIMILAR TO WHAT AN IPAD IS ABLE TO OFFER

I EXPECT TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER S SEAT JUST NEED TO ADJUST TO THIS NEW VEHICLE

I EXPECTED THIS CAR TO COME WITH WARNING LIGHTS WHEN CHANGING LANES OR CHANGING LANES WITH ANOTHER CAR TOO CLOSE 
I EXPERIENCE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES IF I ONLY USE THE SIDE MIRRORS I MUST ALWAYS TURN MY HEAD TO CHECK LANES BEFORE CHANGING 
I EXPERIENCE EXTREMELY POOR VISIBILITY IF I TURN MY HEAD TO CHECK FOR CARS BEHIND TRUNK IS NO GOOD DESIGNED 
I EXPERIENCE PERSONALLY CENTERED DIFFICULTY IN JUDGING DISTANCES FORWARD AND BACKWARD I SUPPOSE THESE MAY DIMINISH WITH MORE DRIVING EXPERIENCE 
I FAVOR BLUETOOTH AUDIO CONNECTION OVER USB BECAUSE USB TAKES FAR TOO LONG TO RECOGNIZE DEVICE AND INDEX MUSIC THIS MEANS I LOSE OUT ON DISPLAY INFORMATION SUCH AS SONG TITLE ETC AND SOME VOICE COMMANDS 
I FEEL ALL VEHICLES SHOOULD HAVE ALARM WHEN BACKING
I FEEL AN OBLIGATION TO HAVE MY FAMILY IN THE SAFEST VEHICLE POSSIBLE I BELIEVE VOLVO FULFILLS THAT OBLIGATION IN EVERY WAY 
I FEEL AS IF MOST CARS TODAY HAVE MORE BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING TO CHANGE LANES OR LOOKING TO BACK UP IT IS NOT JUST THE MODEL CAR I OWN BUT ALL THAT I CHECKED BEFORE BUYING MY CAR I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BLIND SPOT CAMERA S OR INDICATORS PLACED IN

I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR
I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE IN THIS CAR 
I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE IN THIS CAR IT HUGS THE ROAD CORNERS WELL AND HAS LOTS OF GREAT SAFETY FEATURES IT IS A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OUT THE REAR/SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES BUT HAS GOOD VISIBILITY FOR A COUPE IT IS HEAVY AND STURDY BUT STILL AGILE 
I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE
I FEEL I AM ABLE TO DRIVE SAFELY BECAUSE I CAN SEE AROUND ME WELL AND THE WARNING SYSTEM WHILE BACKING UP IS GREAT AND THE SIGNAL ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR WARNING YOU THAT THERE IS A CAR IN YOUR BLIND SPOT IS GREAT 
I FEEL I DON T HAVE A CLEAR VIEW OF THE REAR WHEN LOOKING OUT THE WINDOWS 
I FEEL IN CONTROL THE VEHICLE FEELS VERY RESPONSIVE
I FEEL IT HAS A MORE SOLID BODY AND EASIER TO STEER FEEL VERY SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE 
I FEEL IT IS A VERY SAFE CAR HANDLES EXCEPTIONALLY WELL SOLID BUILD LOVE IT 
I FEEL IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE THE PHONE WHILE DRIVING I E MAKING CALLS VOICE RECOGNITION ISN T VERY RELIABLE AND HANDS FREE TO INITIATE CALLS IS EITHER IMPOSSIBLE OR MUST BE TOO DIFFICULT BECAUSE I SURE HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO MASTER IT 
I FEEL IT THE CAR IS WELL BUILT BUT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY IN A COLLISION WITH A LARGER VEHICLE PERHAPS THIS IS JUST AN ISSUE WITH SEDANS IN THIS SIZE RANGE 
I FEEL LIKE ALL NEWER CARS ARE SORT OF FLIMSY NOT SOLID LIKE OLDER MODELS 
I FEEL LIKE ARE A LOT OF BLIND ZONES IN THE VEHICLE SPECIALLY WHEN BACKING UP 
I FEEL LIKE DUE TO THE VEHICLE BEING SO SMALL WE KIND OF DON T FEEL AS SAFE AS YOU WOULD IF YOUR WERE DRIVING A LARGER VEHICLE 
I FEEL LIKE I AM COMPLETELY AWARE OF THE LOCATION OF ALL FOUR CORNERS OF THE CAR AT ALL TIMES WHEN DRIVING THIS MAKES PARKING MERGING AND CITY DRIVING A BREEZE 
I FEEL LIKE I CAN T GET A FULL VIEW BEHIND ME WHEN I AM BACKING UP OR CHANGING LANES 
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A BIGGER BLIND SPOT THAN I DO BUT IT MAKES ME DOUBLE AND TRIPLE CHECK AND CONTORT TO MAKE SURE I AM CLEAR 
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A REALLY BIG BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND CHANGING LANES IF THERE IS A CAR DRIVING RIGHT AT THE REAR OF MY PASSENGER SIDE IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO SEE 
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BLIND SPOTS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN OF THE REAR WINDOW

I FEEL LIKE I M WELL PROTECTED INSIDE MY E300 
I FEEL LIKE IT CAME EQUIPPED WITH THE CHEAPEST WIPER BLADES POSSIBLE AND THEY NEEDED TO BE REPLACES RIGHT AWAY ALSO THE BLIND SPOT LOOKING OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER MAKES ME NERVOUS 
I FEEL LIKE IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT I CAN TURN MY HEAD BUT THE SUPPORT BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK DOOR IS IN THE WAY 
I FEEL LIKE IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT THE FRONT PERIPHERALLY BECAUSE OF THAT NEW FUNKY TINY WINDOW THEY PUT IN THE FRONT THE SUPPORT FOR IT IS IN THE WAY OF LOOKING FOR CARS COMING FROM THE RIGHT I FEEL THE BLIND SPOT IS WORSE FOR THIS CAR THAN M 
I FEEL LIKE IT IS SET UP AWKWARDLY 
I FEEL LIKE IT IS VERY EASY TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK AND I M NOT VERY TALL 5 3 
I FEEL LIKE IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE CONFIDENT ABOUT CHANGING LANES DUE TO LACK OF SEEING BLIND SPOT I EVEN BOUGHT AN EXTRA WIDE ANGLE CONCAVE MIRROR TO ADHERE TO THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR 
I FEEL LIKE NAVAGATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED
I FEEL LIKE THE 2015 IS LIGHTER THAN THE 2012 SO IT FEELS LESS STURDY 
I FEEL LIKE THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT SHINING OUT FAR ENOUGH ON LOW BEAM LIKE I AM OVERDRIVING THE LIGHTS 
I FEEL LIKE THE HEADLIGHTS COULD BE BRIGHTER AND MORE FAR REACHING 
I FEEL LIKE THE MERCEDES IS BUILT MUCH MORE TOUGHER THAN MY PREVIOUS 200 LOTS OF LEG ROOM AND VISIBILITY AND LESS BLIND SPOTS ARE A PLUS
I FEEL LIKE THE REARVIEW MIRROR IS KIND OF SMALL 
I FEEL LIKE THE SIRIUS XM RADIO IS LOUDER THAN FM OR IPOD EXAMPLE VOLUME LEVEL 20 IS LOUD ON SAT BUT NEED TO PUMP UP TO 25 28 ON FM
I FEEL LIKE THE SLOPE OF FRONT WINDSHIELD IS MORE DRAMATIC AND HAS MORE LIMITED VISIBILITY THAN IN PAST MURANOS THE SUN VISORS DON T GO ALL THE WAY OVER SO THERE ARE MOMENTS WHERE THE SUN COMES IN BETWEEN VISOR AND FRONT WINDSHIELD DIVIDER BETWE

I FEEL LIKE THERE S A DRIVER S SIDE BLINDSPOT BUT OTHERWISE I REALLY LIKE THE VISIBILITY FROM THE VEHICLE 
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE SAFEST CAR I VE OWNED 
I FEEL LIKE THIS VEHICLE IS VERY LIGHT FOR EXAMPLE THE REAR DOOR IS SO LIGHT I WORRY ABOUT IMPACT I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE BLIND SPOTS IN THIS VEHICLE THE LEFT HAND FRAME ON THE DRIVER S SIDE BLOCKS VISION WHEN TAKING 
I FEEL LIKE USEFUL FEATURES ARE SECOND NATURE IN CARE
I FEEL MORE ACTIVE WHEN CHECKING BLIND SPOTS RATHER THAN LOOKING AT SIDE MIRRORS YOU HAVE TO TURN YOUR HEAD AND SHIFT YOUR BODY IN SOME SITUATIONS 
I FEEL MUCH MORE IN CONTROL AND SAFE THAN WITH ANY OTHER VEHICLE I VE HAD

I FEEL SPEAKERS SHOULD SOUND BETTER
I FEEL SUPER COMFORTABLE DRIVING THIS CAR AND ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT 
I FEEL THAT ALL KIAS SHOULD HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND MINE DOESN T
I FEEL THAT ALL THE 2015 SHOULD HAVE THE 8 INCH TOUCH SCREEN WITH ALL THE FEATHERS IN IT IT S REALLY SAD THAT I CAN NOT GET THE RADIO INSTALLED AT A DODGE DEALERSHIP HOWEVER I CAN GET A SUNROOF IN STALLED AT THE DEALERSHIP 
I FEEL THAT AS THE POPULATION OF DRIVERS GET OLDER THEY NEED THE HELP OF ALL THE SAFETY DEVICES THAT IS ON THIS CAR THIS IS ONE REASON WHY I TRADED IN MY 2012 LEGACY IS FOR THE SAFETY REASONS I LOVE THIS CAR
I FEEL THAT BACK UP CAMERA S BLIND SPOT INDICATORS SHOULD BE STANDARD IN EVERY VECHICLE IT SHOULD NOT BE A SPECIAL PRICE FOR THOSE FEATURES 
I FEEL THAT HAVING VOLUME CONTROLS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD BE A BETTER PLACEMENT I SAY THIS BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER CONTROLS INCLUDING THE SHIFT KNOB IS ON THE RIGHT AND IT IS CUMBERSOME TO LOWER THE VOLUME WHILE EITHER SHIFTI 
I FEEL THAT I CAN T SEE VEHICLES AHEAD AND TO THE LEFT OF ME AS WELL AS I SHOULD DUE TO THE SIDE POST THING ON THE DRIVERS SIDE NEXT TO THE WINDSHIELD

I FEEL THAT THE 2 BARS ON EACH OF THE SIDES OF THE FRONT WIND ARE BLOCKING MY VISION
I FEEL THAT THE BRAKING MECHANISM IN THE CRUISE CONTROL MODE COULD BEGIN BREAKING A LITTLE SOONER OR AT LEAST LESS ACCELERATION AS IN NORMAL DRIVING RATHER THAN AN ABRUPT BREAKING GETTING UP CLOSE TO THE SLOWING OR STOPPING VEHICLE 
I FEEL THAT THE CHAIR SET UP IS PERFECT I AM SHORT AND WHEN I PUT MY SEAT ALL THE WAY UP I CAN STILL REACH THE PEDAL
I FEEL THAT THE CONTROL PANEL FOR THE RADIO AND BACK UP CAMERA IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH I HAVE YET TO LOOK IN MY MANUAL TO SEE IF THE BRIGHTNESS CAN BE ADJUSTED 
I FEEL THAT THE FORD EXPEDITION IS THE BEST VEHICLE OUT THERE FOR SAFETY AND VISIBILITY ALSO IT IS EXCEPTIONAL FOR TOWING A TRAILER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NOT HAVING TOWING MIRRORS 
I FEEL THAT THE FRAME AROUND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD SOMETIMES DISTORTS MY VIEW WISH THERE COULD BE A WAY TO MAKE IT LESS OF A DISTRACTION
I FEEL THAT THE HEADLIGHTS COULD BE BRIGHTER EVEN THE HIGH BEAMS DO NOT SEEM AS BRIGHT AS THEY SHOULD BE 
I FEEL THAT THE HEADREST BLOCKS MY VIEW WHEN CHECKING MY BLINDSPOTS ESPECIALLY IN MULTIPLE LANE HIGHWAYS 
I FEEL THAT THE MIRROWS SHOULD HAVE 25% LARGER FIELD OF VIEW TO BE OPTIMIAL I M VERY CAREFUL WHEN USING THE MIRROWS BECAUSE OF BLIND SPOTS 
I FEEL THAT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOICE RECOGNITION AND CELL PHONE CONNECTIVITY AREN T STATE OF THE ART I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT APPLE S CAR PLAY WASN T AVAILABLE 
I FEEL THAT THE PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM COULD BE BETTER

I FEEL THAT THE VEHICLE S MANEUVERABILITY WOULD HELP ME AVOID ACCIDENTS
I FEEL THAT THE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT 
I FEEL THAT THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT 
I FEEL THAT THE VISIBILTY OUT THE BACK OF THE VEHICAL IS BLOCKED BY THE SIDE PILLERS MORE THAN I AM USED TO FROM MY OTHER VEHICALS
I FEEL THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS TOO CUMBERSOME THERE ARE TOO MANY STEPS AND OFTEN I WILL JUST GIVE UP AND USE MY SMARTPHONE IN MY SMARTPHONE I CAN JUST SAY STARBUCKS AND IT WILL SHOW ME OPTIONS 
I FEEL THAT THERE IS A TINY BLIND SPOT BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SIDE WINDOWS BUT I LIKE THE LOOK OF THEM 
I FEEL THAT THERE IS POOR VISIBILITY THE SHAPE OF THE WINDOWS AND BACK SEAT HEADRESTS CUT DOWN ON OUTSIDE VISIBILITY IN OTHER WORDS MY VIEW IS BLOCKED 
I FEEL THE FRONT MIRROW/WINDOW IS INDENTED TO MUCH LEAVES AND ITEMS KEEP GETTING CAUGHT AROUND THE PERIMITTER PLUS NOT EASY TO CLEAN BECAUSE OF THIS SNOW MINOR ISSUE BUT THIS IS THE ONLY THING I DONT LIKE ABOUT THE CAR COMPARED TO THE 2002 SONA 
I FEEL THE HEAD LIGHT COULD BE BETTER
I FEEL THE HEADLIGHTS ARE A BIT TOO DIM SHOULD BE BRIGHTER
I FEEL THE HEADLIGHTS ESPECIALLY THE LOW BEAM IS NOT THAT BRIGHT AND COULD POSSIBLY BE IMPROVED BY EITHER USE OF A DIFFERENT TYPE OF LAMP OR MAYBE ADJUSTING THE LIGHT UNIT ITSELF I DO NOT FEEL THE VISIBILITY ON BRIGHT IS A BAD BUT ON LOW I J 
I FEEL THE HEADLIGHTS SHOULD COME ON AUTOMATICALLY WHEN THE WIPERS ARE ON
I FEEL THE LOW BEAMS ARE A LITTLE TOO LOW LIGHTING 
I FEEL THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WITH THE COLLISION WARNING AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS GREAT 
I FEEL THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THE VEHICLE HEADLIGHTS MAYBE A HID LIGHT WOULD BE A BETTER SET UP
I FEEL THE REAR VISIBILITY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED JUST A SMIDGE 
I FEEL THE REAR WINDSHIELD IS SMALL AND DOESN T ALLOW FOR SUPERB VISIBILITY MOST ESPECIALLY WHEN THE REAR HEADRESTS ARE UP THE SIDE WINDOWS ARE ALSO A BIT SMALL ACCEPTABLE BUT COULD BE A BIT LARGER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY 
I FEEL THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE UNDER SIZED
I FEEL THE TECH PACKAGE SHOULD BE ENABLED EVERY TIME YOU START THE CAR SOMETIMES I FORGET TO TURN IT ON AND WHEN I DO FORGET THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE OF NO USE 
I FEEL THE TIRES SHOULD BE BIGGER FOR MORE STABILITY
I FEEL THE VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE WHEN TURNING LEFT AND HAVING TO LOOK OUT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THE RIGHT BACK SEAT WINDOW AND FRAMEWORK CAUSE THE VISIBILITY TO BE HASTENED 
I FEEL THE WARNING BELLS ARE TOO TOUCHY THEY GO OFF WHEN THEIR IS NO OTHER CAR VERY CLOSE TO ME

I FEEL THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT BETWEEN THE DRIVERS SIDE RIGHT HAND WINDOW AND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WHERE THE TWO WINDOWS PAIR UP I HAVE ALMOST HIT THREE PEOPLE CROSSING THE STREET BECAUSE OF THIS IT HAS TAKEN ME SOME TIME TO GET USED TO HAVIN 
I FEEL THERE IS A SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN AVERAGE BLIND SPOT LR
I FEEL THERE IS NOT ENOUGH VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW
I FEEL THERE SHOULD BE BUILT IN CONVEC MIRRORS FOR CHANGING LANES 
I FEEL THIS CAR HAS GREAT VISIBILITY AND HANDLES REALLY WELL THIS ADDS TO THE OVERALL FEELING OF SAFETY

I HAVE USED THE NAV SYSTEM ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE ROUTES DIRECTED WERE OUT OF THE WAY AND A LONGER TRAVEL TIME REQUIRED

I HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO MAKE A PHONE CALL FROM THE CAR I ALWAYS USE MY PHONE TO DIAL THE NUMBER IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A PHONE BUTTON ON THE DASH WITHOUT GOING THROUGH MULTIPLE BUTTONS TO MAKE A CALL 
I HAVEN T FOUND THE RADIO SYSTEM OVERLY GREAT BUT THEN I DON T LISTEN TO THE RADIO MUCH SO IT IS NOT A BIG DEAL I AM MORE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO CD S 
I HAVEN T HAD BLUETOOTH BEFORE AND I LOVE IT AS WELL AS THE NAVIGATION 
I HAVEN T HAD IT LONG ENOUGH TO JUDGE ALL FEATURES
I HAVEN T HAD MUCH SUCCESS WITH VOICE RECOGNITION TO CHANGE FROM SATELLITE TO FM RADIO I MOSTLY USE THE THUMB WHEEL TO MAKE THE CHANGES

I HAVEN T HAD THE VEHICLE LONG ENOUGH TO REALLY GIVE A PROPER OPINION SO THESE SCORES ARE SOME WHAT LOWER THEN THEY MIGHT POSSIBLY BE BE WHAT I HAVE USED I WOULD GIVE HIGH MARKS TO
I HAVEN T HAD TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE ENTIRE COMMUNICATION/AUDIO SYSTEM SO I HESITATE TO OFFER AN OPINION AT THIS TIME THE 7 RATING SHOULD NOT WEIGHTED ACCORDINGLY LOOKING FORWARD TO MASTERING THE VOICE COMMANDS 
I HAVEN T HAD TO USE THE NAB YET BUT I M SURE IT WILL BE GREAT
I HAVEN T HAD TO USE THE NAVIGATION YET SO I CAN T GIVE YOU FURTHER DETAILS THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR USING THE PHONE BOOK COULD BE BETTER IT SOMETIMES DRAWS UP A NAME THAT SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE I SAID 
I HAVEN T LEARNED IT ALL I HAVE A LOT OF READING AND PLAYING AROUND WITH EVERYTHING TO LEARN IT BEEN SO BUSY SINCE I PICKED IT UP 
I HAVEN T LEARNED TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS OF YET
I HAVEN T NEEDED TO USE THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM SO I HOPE MY OVERALL RATING DOES NOT SKUE THE STATISTICS THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FINE 
I HAVEN T PROGRAMMED THE RADIO BUTTONS YET THEY ARE CONFUSING BUT I KNOW THAT ONCE I DON THAT I LL BE VERY HAPPY WITH IT 
I HAVEN T QUITE FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE ALL THOSE WONDERFUL FEATURES! I BELIEVE THAT MY RATING HERE WOULD BE HIGHER IF I WERE ACTIVELY USING ALL THE VEHICLE S AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
I HAVEN T READ THE MANUAL BUT SO FAR THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM ISN T VERY HELPFUL AND IT S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ME WHEN I CALL THEM USING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION BECAUSE OF THE SURROUNDING NOISE 
I HAVEN T REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO USE ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT AS I DRIVE TWO CARS 
I HAVEN T REALLY TAKEN THE TIME YET TO BECOME FLUENT IN USE OF VOICE COMMAND FEATURES 
I HAVEN T REALLY USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BECAUSE IT LOOKS CONFUSING AND I HAVEN T HAD THE TIME TO LEARN IT 
I HAVEN T REALLY USED THEM THAT MUCH TO BE THAT HELPFUL

I HAVEN T TAKEN THE TIME TO REALLY PRACTICE WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
I HAVEN T TRIED ALL THE FEATURES SO I DON T KNOW 
I HAVEN T TRIED TO USE IT YET AND HAVEN T DRIVEN THE VEHICLE ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION 
I HAVEN T TRULY EXPLORED ALL OF THE CAPABILITIES YET BUT LOVE THE BLUTOOTH TECHNOLOGY 
I HAVEN T USED ALL FEATURES I LIKE THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS 
I HAVEN T USED ANYTHING EXCEPT THE RADIO SELECTING THE RADIO CHANNEL IS DIFFICULT WHEN DRIVING THE SELECTOR ON THE STEERING WHEEL SEEMS TO JUMP IN LARGE INCREMENTS ACROSS THE SELECTABLE CHANNELS UNLESS THIS IS A DEFECT IN THE AUDIO SYSTEM? 
I HAVEN T USED IT ENOUGH TO SAY EXCEPT THAT WHEN THE SALESPERSON USED IT TO DEMONSTRATE IT TO ME IT WAS VERY GOOD I STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS MYSELF 
I HAVEN T USED SOME OF THE FEATURES YET
I HAVEN T USED THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH IT I AM STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE IT MAKING IT EASIER TO USE WOULD BE THE ONE ASPECT I WOULD CHANGE 
I HAVEN T USED THE BLUETOOTH THING YET AND I DON T HAVE BUILT IN GPS 
I HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
I HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT I WOULD I DO NOT FIND IT EASY TO USE THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL IS NOT THAT HELPFUL I WOULD LIKE A LIST OF STEPS IF THIS THEN THIS ETC I HAVEN T SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS I SHOULD IN LEA 
I HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET SO NO COMMENT FOR THAT SIRIUS RADIO AND CD PLAYER BOTH SOUND VERY GOOD 
I HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATIONS SYSTEM YET AS I DON T KNOW HOW!!!!!!
I HAVEN T USED THE PHONE INTERCONNECT I REALLY LIKE THE RADIO BUTTONS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL THEY RE RIGHT WHERE YOUR FINGERTIPS ARE PERFECT PLACEMENT 
I HAVEN T USED THE VOICE ACTIVATED CONTROLS I M NOT MUCH INTO THAT 
I HAVEN T UTILIZED MOST OF THE FEATURES YET I PLAN ON IT THOUGH LOOKS EASY OVERALL TO USE 
I HAVEN T UTITIZED ALL THE FEATURES BUT I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THOSE FEATURES I HAVE USED 
I HAVENT GOT THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO RECOGNIZE WHAT I WAS SAYING WHEN READING WHAT IT WANTS ME TO SAY 
I HAVENT USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET
I HEART RADIO 
I HIGHLIGHTED ON THAT PREVIOUSLY HAVING TO REPEAT MYSELF TO BE TOLD I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR REQUEST ON THE NAVIGATION I HAVE YET TO HAVE IT WORK WHEN I SPEAK AN ADDRESS I ALWAYS HAVE TO TYPE IT OR USE ONSTAR 
I HIT ICE IN A SNOWSTORM THE CAR RESPONDED VERY WELL TO MY ACTIONS IT DIDN T OVER RESPOND OR UNDER RESPOND 
I HONESTLY CAN T SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW AT ALL
I HOPE MY RDX HAS BETTER SIDE MIROW AND BETTER HEAD LIGHT

I KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY GETTING AN OVERHAULED SO I M CURIOUS ON WHAT I WILL BE MISSING BIGGEST COMPLAINT ON MY SYSTEM IS THAT IT OFTEN EVEN SOMETIMES AFTER A QUICK STOP TO THE GAS STATION WILL HAVE TO RE INDEX MY MP3 PLAYER BUT IT 
I KNOW THE COLUMNS ARE LARGE BECAUSE OF ROLLOVER PROTECTION SO THERE IS LITTLE THAT CAN BE DONE BESIDES USING THE STRONGEST METAL FOR THE ROOF IT COULD BE WORSE 
I KNOW THE TOUCH SYSTEM IS SUPPOSE TO MAKE THINGS EASIER BUT I FIND I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND MANY TIMES I HIT THE WRONG THING AND IT GOES INTO THE SETTINGS MODE

I M JUST LEARNING ALL THE FEATURES SO I DON T KNOW WHAT COULD BE IMPROVED

I M JUST TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH TECH STUFF 
I M JUST USED TO A LARGER REAR WINDOW WILL TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO 
I M LESS HAPPY WITH SIDE VISIBILITY AT STOPLIGHTS AND SUCH THIS IS DUE TO THE CAR S LOW PROFILE AND MY HEIGHT 
I M NEVER LOST JUST LOVE IT 
I M NEW TO BLUETOOTH LOVE NOT HAVING TO GET THE PHONE OUT OF MY PURSE AMAZED AT THE SOUND QUALITY HAVEN T TRIED THE MUSIC STREAMING ASPECTS YET 
I M NOT A BIG FAN OF THE SENSOR TRIGGERED WIPERS THEY DON T ALWAYS REACT TO CONDITIONS LIKE I EXPECT THEM TO WOULD PREFER TRADITIONAL INTERMITTENT WIPERS FOR MORE CONTROL 
I M NOT A BIG MUSIC OR TECHNOLOGY PERSON I M SURE THIS SYSTEM IS FAR MORE ADVANCED THAN I AM 
I M NOT A BIG RADIO LISTENER I DON T HAVE ANYTHING

I M NOT A TECHNO NERD AND I DON T PLAN ON CONTINUING THE ON STAR SERVICES AFTER THE FREE 6 MONTHS ITS HARD FOR ME TO RATE THESE ITEMS AS I DON T USE THEM I D RATHER THE CAR CAME WITH CRUISE CONTROL 
I M NOT AN ACTIVE USER MY WIFE IS BUGGING ME TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE STUFF I AM NOT COMFORTABLE WITH TECH 
I M NOT CLEAR IF MY CAR HAS HD RADIO AND IF IT DOES IT IS NOT WORKING 
I M NOT FAMILIAR WITH NAV SYSTEMS AND THIS IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO USE I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO ATTEND A CLASS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IT 
I M NOT FINDING AN PROBLEM WITH BLIND SPOTS PLUS THE BACK UP AND COLLISION FEATURE ARE A GREAT HELP LOVE THEM! ONE OF MY REQUIREMENTS WHEN LEASING THIS CAR 
I M NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE SOUND /4 SPEAKER QUALITY 
I M NOT IN MY VEHICLE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME BUT I DO USE THE HANDS FREE PHONE OPTIONS AND I LOVE THE TOUCH SCREEN SELECTIONS OF PRESETS FOR MY RADIO STATIONS I SWITCH STATIONS FREQUENTLY 
I M NOT MUCH OF A TECHIE SO MUCH OF THE TECH SYSTEMS GO UNUSED HOWEVER THE ONES I DO USE NAV XM RADIO I REALLY ENJOY 
I M NOT PARTICULARLY TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY SO I FIND THESE SYSTEMS DIFFICULT TO USE 
I M NOT REALLY SURE BUT IT DOES HAVE TO BE CORRECTED 
I M NOT SURE IF IT IS THE DESIGN OR JUST HAS TO DO WITH THE SIZE OF THE CAR BUT THE VIEW OUT OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD SEEMS A LOT BETTER THAN MOST VEHICLES YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING 
I M NOT SURE IF IT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED OR NOT BUT THE POI DOESN T SEEM TO WORK I CAN BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF A GAS STATION AND IT TELLS ME THERE IS NOT GAS STATION NEAR BY ALSO UNLESS I AM DOING SOMETHING WRONG I HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO DOWNLOAD 2 
I M NOT SURE IF IT WOULD BE LEGAL/POSSIBLE BUT USING THE AROUND VIEW CAMERAS WHILE DRIVING MIGHT BE NICE 
I M NOT SURE WHAT OTHER AUDIO FEATURES THE CAR HAS I ONLY MAKE AND RECEIVE CALLS DON T KNOW ABOUT TEXT EMAIL ETC COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER EXPLAINED BY SALESPERSON 
I M NOT SURE WHERE THE SPEAKER LOCATION IS FOR PHONE CALLS BUT I DRIVE ON THE INTERSTATE MOST OF THE TIME AND PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING ME TALK AND I FEEL LIKE I M YELLING I USUALLY JUST TURN OFF THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE DURING A CALL SO I AM 
I M NOT SURE WHETHER IT MY PHONE OR THE CAR BUT IT SEEMS HARD FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ME WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE FEATURE 
I M NOT THE MOST SOPHISTICATED WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTRONICS SO I FIND IT SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO USE 
I M NOT TOO HAPPY THAT IT DIDNT COME WITH A REAR VIEW CAMERA VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE
I M NOT VERY TECH SAVVY AND STEP BY STEP QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE WOULD BE HELPFUL 
I M NOT VERY TECHNICAL BUT IT S EASY TO USE THE OLD FASHION WAY TOO WHICH IS WHY I LIKE IT 
I M NOT YET FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THE WHOLE SYSTEM 
I M OLD FASHIONED AND ONLY DO FM AND CD I DO LIKE THE RADIO TELLING ME THE ARTIST AND THE SONG NAME 
I M OLD SCHOOL I D RATHER HAVE KNOBS AND BUTTONS AND LCD DISPLAY OVER TOUCH SCREEN
I M OLD SCHOOL NOT A BIG TECHY GUY SYSTEM IS VERY WELL DESIGNED AND VERY GOOD EASE OF USE
I M OLDER AND DON T USE THESE FUCTIONS MUCH 
I M ONLY 5 FOOT 1 INCH TALL AND IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE DRIVERS SEAT WOULD COME UP HIGHER THEN IT CURRENTLY DOES 
I M ONLY SORRY I DIDN T GET THE NAV SYSTEM
I M PETITE SO SEEING OVER SUV S ALTHOUGH NOT LARGE CAN BE A PROBLEM IT S NATURE NOT MANUFACTURER ISSUE 
I M PETITE SO THE SUN VISOR DOESN T WORK FOR ME IT DOES DO ITS JOB WHEN AN AVERAGE HEIGHT TO ABOVE AVERAGE HEIGHT DRIVER IS BEHIND THE WHEEEL
I M PRETTY HAPPY WITH ALL ASPECTS 
I M PRETTY HAPPY WITH IT 
I M PRETTY NEUTRAL ON EACH OF THESE POINTS 
I M QUITE HAPPY WITH IT AS IS
I M REALLY HAPPY THAT THEY VE ADDED THE SUN VISOR EXTENDERS I HATED THAT MY 2012 JUKE DIDN T HAVE THEM SO WAS REALLY PLEASED THAT THEY VE SINCE ADDED THEM TO LATER MODELS 
I M REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THE NAV SYSTEM AND MAPS THE VISUAL SCREEN EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST I VE SEEN IN ALL THE CARS I VE EVER BEEN IN
I M REALLY NOT A TECH TYPE PERSON AND SO IF I DON T UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO EVERYTHING I DON T USE IT AUDIO SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT LOVE THE HARD DRIVE WHICH ALLOWS ME TO STORE MANY MANY CD S SO I AM NOT LIMITED TO JUST HAVING A FEW AVAILABLE I CAN RU 
I M REALLY SURPRISED THE SYSTEM WAS DEVELOPED BY MICROSOFT OVERALL IT S USER FRIENDLY AND WELL THOUGHT OUT 
I M SATISFIED
I M SATISFIED WITH VISIBILITY AND SAFETY FEATURES 
I M SEATED TOO LOW IN THE SEAT FOR THE SUN VISOR TO BE EFFECTIVE WHEN I NEED IT I CAN USE MY MIRRORS TO SEE IN THE SIDE LANES BUT WHEN I USE THE SIDE MIRRORS IM LIFTING UP IN MY SEAT JUST TO LOOK OUT OF THEM 
I M SHORT 5 2 AND MY DRIVER S SEAT DOESN T RAISE AND LOWER I WISH I COULD SEE THE FRONT END OF THE CAR A LITTLE BETTER 
I M SHORT 5 3 I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING PAST THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON MOST CARS SURE ADJUST THE SEAT UP BUT THEN MY HEAD TOUCHES THE ROOF AND I CAN T SEE THE GUAGES 
I M SHORT AND CAN T SEE THE FRONT OF THE CAR WHEN TRYING TO PARK OR MANEUVER AS WELL AS I WOULD LIKE TO 
I M SHORT AND HAD TO RAISE THE SEAT TO SEE OVER THE STEERING WHEEL THE REAR WINDOW IS RATHER SMALL 
I M SHORT AND NEED TWO PILLOWS TO SEE OUT BUT STILL HAVE PROBLEMS WITH LOOKING AROUND WINDSHIELD SIDES AND OUTSIDE MIRRORS SAME PROBLEM WITH MY 2008 HYUNDAI 
I M SHORT AND SOMETIMES IN OUR OTHER BMW650I FELT THAT I WASN T HIGH ENOUGH TO SEE WELL OUR NEW CAR SEEMS TO HAVE MORE UPSIDE ADJUSTMENTS TO SEE OUT 
I M SHORT AND THE CAR IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE MORE VISIBILITY BUT BECAUSE OF WHERE I HAVE TO SIT IT REMOVES SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES
I M SHORT BUT CAN EASILY REACH THE PEDALS WITHOUT BEING ON TOP OF THE STEERING WHEEL 
I M SHORT BUT THE MULTIPLE MOVEMENTS OF THE DRIVER SEAT MAKES IT EASY TO ADJUST TO SEE PERFECTLY OUT OVER THE DASH
I M SHORT HAVE TROUBLE SEEING OVER THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN IT S A BIG MIRROR
I M SHORT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO RAISE THE DRIVER S SEAT JUST A LITTLE MORE I FEEL MORE COMFORTALE BEING ABLE TO SEE OVER THE HOOD MORE 
I M SHORT SO A LONGER SUN VISER WOULD BE NICE 
I M SHORT SO I WISH THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE SO THAT THE SUN WOULDN T BE A PROBLEM FOR ME 
I M SHORT SO NO SUN VISOR IS OVERLY EFFECTIVE 
I M SHORT SO NOT MUCH CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT ADJUSTMENTS VEHICLE HAS WORK GREAT AND I TOTALLY FEEL SAVE IN MY JETTA 
I M SHORT SO SUN VISORS ARE NEVER EFFECTIVE ENOUGH 
I M SHORT SO THE SUN VISORS DON T HELP ME 
I M SHORT SO VISIBILITY IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE I WOULD LIKE MORE THAN 3 CHOICES FOR VARIABLE WIPERS 
I M SHORT SO VISORS NOT QUITE LOW ENOUGH
I M SHORT SO YOU D THINK THIS CAR SIZE WOULD BE GREAT FOR ME BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW BECAUSE OF THE HEADRESTS!
I M SHORT TOUGH TO TURN HEAD AND SEE
I M SHORT WISH THERE WAS A RUNNING BOARD ON DRIVER SIDE 
I M SHORTER BUT I FIND THAT VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT 
I M SMALL AND THE A PILLAR IN THE FRONT CAUSES A BLIND SPOT FOR PEDESTRIANS ON STREET CORNERS
I M SO EXCITED FOR THE 2016!
I M SOMEWHAT LOST WITH THE SYSTEM I HAVEN T HAD THE TIME TO ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT ALL OF THE AUDIO CONTROLS AND FEATURES YET 
I M SORRY THAT THE CD PLAYER IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE THE PHONE SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT I CAN HEAR THE CONVERSATION EVEN OVER TRAFFIC NOISE 
I M STILL ADJUSTING TO THE SIZE OF THE REAR BLIND SPOTS 
I M STILL ADJUSTING TO THE VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING IT S DIFFERENT FROM MY LAST VEHICLE MY TOYOTA AVALON 
I M STILL BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEMS BUT CURRENTLY I M ENJOYING THE EASE OF USE 
I M STILL GETTING USED TO ALL THAT IT CAN DO HOWEVER THE THING I USE MOST IS MY PHONE AND HAVING IMMEDIATE AND CLEAR COMMUNICATION ACCESS 
I M STILL GETTING USED TO DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR
I M STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE IT!
I M STILL LEARNING MY CAR
I M STILL LEARNING THE CAPABILITIES BUT THE MORE I LEARN THE MORE IMPRESSED I AM 
I M STILL LEARNING THEM & WISH I COULD HAVE A FEW TUTORIAL LESSONS 
I M STILL LEARNING VOICE RECOGNITION TRAINING HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BUT THERE IS STILL TOO MUCH CONFUSION AND MIS READINGS 
I M STILL ON THE LEARNING CURVE SO BELIEVE ONCE I FIGURE OUT THE TRUE WAY IT WORKS I LL BE BETTER AT IT 
I M SURE IF THERE WAS NOT SO MUCH ROAD NOISE THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND BLUE TOOTH CONNECTIVITY WOULD BE BETTER QUALITY
I M SURE IT WILL IMPROVE WITH MY SKILL IMPROVEMENT OF THE USAGE
I M SURE THAT THE WIPERS ARE EFFECTIVE BUT I HAVE NOT DRIVEN THIS IN THE RAIN YET IN FACT IT ONLY HAS ABOUT 475 MILES ON IT 
I M SURE THERE IS NOTHING THAT KIA CAN DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BUT IT S ANNOYING TO HAVE THE NAMES OF SIMPLE TO PRONOUNCE STREETS MISPRONOUNCED SO FREQUENTLY BY THE NAV SYSTEM E G LADY S ISLAND PARKWAY IS LADIES ISLAND PARKWAY NOT LADDICE ISL 
I M SURPRISED THAT IN THE LEATHER LEVEL BLUETOOTH ISN T STANDARD WE DID NOT GET THE TECH PACKAGE AS IT WAS OUT OF OUR PRICE RANGE FOR ALL THE LUXURY FEEL OF THE VEHICLE NOT HAVING BLUETOOTH SEEMS ODD I D DEFINITELY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE VOI 
I M TALL SO EVEN WITH SEAT IN LOWEST POSITION MY HEAD IS ABOVE MID LEVEL SO REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS LARGER THAN OTHER VEHICLES AND OBSCURES MY VISIBILITY AT TIMES 
I M THE 58 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER HERE WHO DRIVES MOM AND DAD EVERYWHERE SO ALL OF THESE ARE MY COMMENTS I FIND IT HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME ANYWAY THAT THE REAR WINDOW IS AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE THAN OUR 201 
I M THE KIND OF PERSON WHO TURNS THEIR HEAD TO LOOK BACKWARDS TOO MANY THINGS BLOCK THE VIEW 
I M TOO OLD SCHOOL RADIO CD TO RATE OF USE MOST OF THE GADGETS ON THE CAR
I M TOO PARANOID OF OTHERS DRIVING TO EVER FEEL COMPLETELY SAFE 
I M TRULY IN LOVE WITH MY Q70 THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD IMPROVE MY DRIVING EXPERIENCE WOULD BE EYES IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD 
I M TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO BE ABLE TO SEE CARS BEHIND ME WHEN I TURN MY HEAD TO TO THE LEFT I HAVE TO RELY THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
I M UNABLE TO CONNECT TO PANDORA WIRELESSLY I WOULD LIKE TO NOT HAVE TO HOOK MY PHONE TO THE SUB TO USE IT MY VEHICLE TEXT FEATURE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE WORKING 
I M UNABLE TO TAKE OR MAKE CALLS USING THE DEVICE I CANNOT BE HEARD FROM CALLERS 
I M USED TO A SMALLER CAR SO CHANGING LANES I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A BLIND SPOT DON T THINK MUCH CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 2 DOOR GOING TO 4 DOOR 
I M USED TO DRIVING A LARGER CAR LEXUS RX350 SO IT IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO BE DRIVING A SMALLER CAR I PURCHASED IT FOR A LITTLE FUN AND GAS MILEAGE 
I M USED TO IT NOW BUT THE REAR AND BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS A BIT WORSE THAN OTHER VEHICLES NOT A HUGE DEAL 
I M USED TO PHYSICAL BUTTONS AND KNOBS WHEN USING A CAR RADIO THIS IS THE FIRST CAR I HAVE OWNED WITH A TOUCHSCREEN THOUGH THE TOUCHSCREEN ALLOWS MORE FLEXIBILITY I JUST DON T LIKE THE FACT THAT IF I WANT TO CHANGE STATIONS OR AUDIO SETTINGS 
I M USED TO SMALLER CARS AND BEING ABLE TO SEE OUT THE BACK BETTER WHILE PARALLEL PARKING NOT NECESSARILY A PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR AS MUCH AS WHAT I M USED TO REAR CAMERA HELPS EVEN THOUGH AT FIRST I DIDN T THINK IT WAS USEFUL 
I M USED TO THE NAVIGATION APPS I HAVE ON MY PHONE AND PREFER USING THEM HOWEVER I APPRECIATE THAT I CAN USE THE BLUE TOOTH VOICE ACTIVATION THROUGH THE AUDIO/COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
I M USING DAILY AND I REALLY ENJOY QUALITY AND HOW EASY IS USE AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS I CAN T TELL WHAT I M USING MOST THE ALL FEATURES ARE TRULY EXCEPTIONAL WHAT I M EXPECTING AUTOMOBILE TODAY 
I M VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE A COMPASS ON BOARD 
I M VERY HAPPY WITH CAR
I M VERY HAPPY WITH MY CAR
I M VERY HAPPY WITH MY CAR!
I M VERY HAPPY WITH THE VISIBILITY IN THE MACAN AND THE FEELING OF SAFETY WHILE DRIVING IT FEELS VERY STABLE AND PLANTED AT ALL TIMES NO MATTER WHAT THE DRIVING CONDITIONS ARE 
I M VERY PLEASED WITH SOUND SYSTEM IT IS BETTER THEN IN OTHER PREVIOUSLY OWNED VEHICLES 
I M VERY SHORT AND THE SIDE MIRRORS BOCK MY VIEW
I M VERY SURPRISED THAT MERCEDES BENZ HAS NOT REALIZED THAT THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS MUCH TO SMALL FOR TODAY S STANDARDS AND ALMOST AN AFTER THOUGHT IN NAVIGATION IN TODAY S AGE IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN OPTION BUT SHOULD HAVE 
I M VERY UNIMPRESSED BY THE VOICE CONTROLLED NAVIGATION FOR ENTERING AN ADDRESS BY VOICE IT HAS FRUSTRATED ME VERY MUCH AND I HAVE TO PULL OVER TO ENTER AN ADDRESS WHICH IS OK BUT SINCE THE SYSTEM HAS THE ABILITY TO USE HANDS FREE VOICE COMMANDS 
I M VERY USED TO LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER AND NOT DEPENDING ON THE MIRROR BLIND SPOT THING AND IT NOT AS EASY AS MY OLD ONE TO SEE BEHIND ME 
I MAINLY DRIVE IN AN AREA THAT I KNOW SO I DON T USE THE NAVAGATION SYSTEM PLUS I FIND IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND UNLESS A PERSON USES IT OFTEN 
I MAINLY USE SIRIUS 
I MAKE ALL PHONE CALLS VIA THE BLUE TOOTH AND I NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE COMMUNICATION THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE I HAVE PURCHASED WHERE I AM NOT INTERESTED IN PURCHASED THIRD PARTY SPEAKERS THE SOUND IS THE WAY I LIKE IT AT A LOW VOLUME 
I MAY BE MY PHONE BUT I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONNECT MY PHONE TO THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM 
I MAY BE THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE AND BLIND IN LEFT EYE I DEPEND HEAVILY ON MY MIRRORS AND LOOKING TO THE LEFT WHEN CHANGING LANES THE NOTIFICATION OF CARS APPROACING IS GREAT FOR ME AND HAS BEEN EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL HOWEVER I SEEM TO HAVE A 
I MAY HAVE ANSWERED WRONG ON NAVIGATION I DO NOT THINK I HAVE IT I LISTEN TO THE SATELLITE RADIO AND ENJOY BUT TOO BAD IT IS EXTRA AND THE ADDED COST IS NOT IN BUDGET IF NAVIGATION I MAY PURCHASE CAUSE OF GSP
I MAY NOT HAVE USED THE SYSTEMS ENOUGH TO ADEQUATELY JUDGE I THINK THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAYS ARE DISTRACTING AND DANGEROUS SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE IN VEHICLES 
I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT FOR SHORTER PEOPLE THE SEAT DOESN T GO UP HIGH ENOUGH SO I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I CAN T SEE AS WELL AS I WOULD LIKE TO 
I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT I DON T LIKE THE BAR ACROSS THE BACK WINDOW I FEEL VERY SAFE IN A PRIUS THIS IS OUR FAMILY S FIFTH PRUIS AND TWO OF THEM HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS WHERE NO ONE WAS HURT 
I MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER SECTION MY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE AUDIO CONTROLS ALSO I PURCHASED THE PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM BUT IT MEDIOCRE COMPARED TO OTHER BRANDS I VE OWNED THE AUDIO CLARITY AND IMAGING AND SOUND QUALITY IS JUST NOT QUITE WHAT I 
I MENTIONED THE HEADLIGHT ISSUES EARLIER IN THIS SURVEY 
I MENTIONED THIS IN THE LAST SECTION BUT I WILL MENTION IT AGAIN I WORRY ABOUT THE DRIVER OR FRONT PASSENGER HITTING HIS OR HER HEAD AGAINST THE B PILLAR DURING A SIDE IMPACT COLLISION THERE IS LESS DISTANCE BETWEEN MY HEAD AND THE B PILLAR 
I MENTIONED THIS PREVIOUSLY ALREADY
I MESSED UP ANYTHING REGARDING BUILT IN NAVIGATION SHOULD NOT BE USED I WAS CONSIDERING ONSTAR AS BEING BUILT IN NAVIGATION AND DIDN T REALIZE UNTIL LATER IN THE SURVEY THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A BUILT IN GPS SORRY

I MISSING HAVING A MUTE ON THE STEERING WHEEL FOR THE RADIO GRANTED WHEN I USED THE CONTROLS TO MAKE A PHONE CALL IT WILL MUTE MY RADIO BUT THERE ARE OTHER TIMES YOU WANT TO MUTE RADIO AND THE STEERING WHEEL DOESN T HAVE THAT CONTROL
I MOST FREQUENTLY USE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION SINCE MY PASSENGERS CHILDREN USE IT TOO WE FREQUENTLY SWITCH BETWEEN PHONES AND THE USB SEEMS CRANKY OFTEN GETS FUSSY WHEN ADDING PHONES OR SELECTING PHONES
I MOST LIKE THE EASE OF CONNECTING DEVICES VIA BLUETOOTH AND THE HIGH QUALITY SOUND 
I MOST LIKE THE FUEL SEARCH FEATURE THE INTERNET

I MOSTLY ONLY USE BLUETOOTH FOR HAVING CONVERSATIONS THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND I HEAR AND THE MIC ARE EXCEPTIONAL RARELY DOES SOMEONE SAY THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE HEARING ME

I MUCH PREFER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OF MY PREVIOUS CAR TOYOTA THE TOUCH SCREEN WAS EASIER TO USE FOR BOTH PHONE CALLS AND NAVIGATION AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE NUMBER OF STEPS TO MAKE A PHONE CALL ARE WAY TOO MANY IT SHOULD TAKE ONE OR TWO S 
I MUST BE IN A CLUB!
I MYSELF HAVE HAD SOME VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER CAR STEREOS I AM ALMOST NEVER IMPRESSED BY THE FACTORY SOUND SYSTEM NOT A MAJOR ISSUE AS THIS IS NOT WHY I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE 
I NEED A CD PLAYER WHICH MY VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE A PERSON SHOULD NOT BE USING APPS OR FACEBOOK WHEN DRIVING I DO LIKE TO LISTEN TO AUDIO BOOKS AND NOW HAVE TO USE AN EXTERNAL PORTABLE CD PLAYER WHILE DRIVING WHICH IS NOT SAFE OR ATTRACTIVE I 
I NEED A GPS INSTALLED ON MY BESPOKE AUDIO MADE BY PIONEER

I NEED THE REAR VIEW CAMERA TO HELP ME BAG BACK WHILE TRYING TO REVERSE OUT OF PARKING SPACES I THINK ALL THE VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE HAD REAR VIEW CAMERAS TO HELP THEM SEE BEHIND THEM THIS IS A VERY LONG SUV AND THE 3RD ROW SEAT HEADS REST DOESN T 
I NEED TO CONFIRM IF I HAVE VOICE CONTROL THERE IS A BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL HAVEN T SEEN IT WORK 
I NEED TO EXPLORE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE ONE TIME I TRIED TO ENGAGE IT I COULD NOT TURN IT OFF COULDN T MANAGE WHILE ACTIVELY DRIVING PROBABLY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR MORE TRAINING

I NEED TO TOGGLE THRU THE SOURCES WHEN USING THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS AND WHENEVER IT TOGGLES THRU THE BLUETOOTH IT AUTOMATICALLY STARTS PLAYING MUSIC FROM MY IPHONE IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY START PLAYING BECAUSE THEN IT P 
I NEVER FEEL UNSAFE BEHIND THE WHEEL OF MY 2015 WRX 
I NEVER GET LOST
I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO USE MY NAVIGATION IT QUIT WORKING BOUT 2 WEEKS AFTER GOT THE VEHICLE WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS CONTROLS FOR THE DVD IN THE BACK SO I DIDN T HAVE TO CHANGE AND START MOVIES WHILE DRIVING
I NEVER HAD A CAR WITH SUCH FEATURES SO IT IS A FUN NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME 
I NEVER HAD A NAVIGATION SYSTEM BEFORE I REALLY LIKE IT 
I NEVER HAD BLUE TOOTH IN MY CAR AND I LIKE THAT I HAVE HANDS FREE PHONE AND THE MUSIC ON MY PHONE IS STREAMING THROUGH THE CAR
I NEVER HAD NAVIGATION BEFORE IT IS A VERY HELPFUL FEATURE WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO A PLACE YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN BEFORE EVEN WITH LOCAL DRIVING 
I NEVER HAD ONE BEFORE SO IT S ALL GOOD TO ME 
I NEVER HAVE TO ADJUST THE WIPERS TOTALLY AUTOMATIC
I NEVER KNEW GREAT HEADLIGHTS AND VISION AT NIGHT UNTIL I BOUGHT THIS CAR 
I NEVER TOOK THE TIME TO SET UP THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IF IT WERE READY TO USE FROM THE START I MIGHT ACTUALLY USE THE NAVIGATION FEATURE 
I NEVER USE ANY OF THIS I NEVER TURN ON THE RADIO NOR USE ANY OF THE CONNECTIVBITY CONTROLS AS I DO NOT HAVE A SMART PHONE NOR NEED BLUETOOTH I WANT TO HEAR TRAFFIC NOISES AND STAY ALERT 
I NEVER USE MY PHONE IN THIS VEHICLE EASIER TO DIAL MYSELF THAN TRY AND USE THE U CONNECT SYSTEM
I NEVER USE THE ABOVE MENTIONED SYSTEMS 
I NEVER USE THE IN VEHICLE NAVIGATION OR VOICE CONTROLS I ALWAYS USE MY IPHONE WITH SIRI TO CONTROL NAVIGATION AUDIO TEXT MESSAGES ETC 
I NEVER USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE SO IT S HARD FOR ME TO JUDGE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I HAVE FOUND FAIRLY HARD TO USE I LIKE THE MAPS APP ON MY IPHONE BETTER PERSONALLY HOWEVER I DON T THINK I VE GIVEN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ENOUGH OF 
I NEVER WAS ABLE TO TURN ON/SIGN IN TO THE SIRIUS SYSTEM SINCE I WAS NOT GOING TO USE IT I GAVE UP TRYING 
I NOTICE A LARGE BLIND SPOT ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE OF VEHICLE 
I NOTICE THAT EVERY CAR I DRIVE OR RIDE IN BASE BLIND SPOTS WERE MY OLD CARES DO NOT I HATE THAT
I NOTICE THE HEADLIGHTS MOVE I STILL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY READING INFO SIGNS ON THE INTERSTATE AT NIGHT DON T SEEM TO BE QUITE HIGH ENOUCH 
I NOTICE WHEN CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH TO SITES SUCH AS YOUTUBE THE VOLUME CONTROL NEEDS TO BE MOVED UP HIGHER TO GET A BETTER MUSIC EXPERIENCE 
I NOTICED I HAVE A BLIND SPOT TURNING RIGHT ONTO A ROAD 130 TURN
I NOTICED THAT THE REAR VIEW IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE BECAUSE THERE IS A BORDER SEPARATION BETWEEN ONE WINDOW TO ANOTHER THERE IS A LINE THAT RUNS ACROSS THE BACK WINDOW THAT SEPARATES THE WIPERS & A LOWER PART OF THE TRUNK IF IT WERE CO 
I NOTICED THE BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY PREVALENT IN THIS CAR I WISH WE HAD THE CAR INDICATOR THAT TELLS YOU SOME IS IN THE LANE NEXT TO YOU 
I NOTICED THE MAP WAS OUT OF DATE WHEN THE SPEED LIMITS LISTED ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DID NOT MATCH THE CURRENT SPEED LIMIT CHANGES I QUESTIONED THE OUT OF DATE INFORMATION BECAUSE I HAVE A PORTABLE GARMIN SYSTEM THAT DOES SHOW THE CURRENT SPEE 
I NOTICED WHEN I FIRST DROVE THE CAR WHEN CHANGING LANES THERE IS A SMALL BLIND SPOT IN THE BACK WHERE THE SIDE OF THE CARE MEETS THE BACK WINDOW WHEN I LOOKED IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR YOU CAN NOT SEE IF A CAR IS RIGHT AT THAT SPOT I NOW TURN MY 
I OFTEN LOOSE MY BTA AUDIO CONNECTION IF TEXT OR PHONE IS ANSWERED WHILE PLAYING UNABLE TO GO BACK TO IT 
I OFTEN NEED TO TURN UP MY VOLUME TO A HIGHER LEVEL WHEN TAKING PHONE CALLS 
I OFTEN USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT I HAVEN T YET CAUGHT ON TO USING THE VOICE ACTIVATED SYSTEM SO SOMEHOW THE INTERFACE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY 
I ONLY HAVE 500 MILES ON THE CAR AND NEVER RECEIVED A TUTORIAL SESSION WITH A DELIVERY SPECIALIST WHICH I INTEND TO DO SOON THEREFORE I REALLY DON T KNOW HOW TO OPERATE MANY OF THE FEATURES YOU ARE ASKING ME TO EVALUATE YOU ALSO DO NOT LET ME O 
I ONLY HAVE AN AUDIO SYSTEM
I ONLY HAVE AUDIO IT DIDN T COME WITH ALL THE OTHER GOOD STUFF 
I ONLY HAVE ISSUES WITH COMMANDS OF THE HANDS FREE IT IS PROBABLY ME BUT SHE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT COMMAND I AM ASKING A LOT OF THE TIMES YES THERE ARE A LOT OF STEPS TO SIMPLY MAKE A CALL 
I ONLY HAVE LISTENED TO THE RADIO AND HAVE NOT USED MY PHONE THRU THE CAR
I ONLY HAVE THE RADIO AND IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTROLS 
I ONLY LISTEN TO THE RADIO DON T MAKE CALLS OR TEXT AND DON T HAVE GPS 
I ONLY LISTEN TO THE RADIO NO BLUE TOOTH WHATEVER THAT IS AND NO INTERNET I AM NON TECH
I ONLY PLAY MUSIC FROM APP BASED STREAMING PLAYLISTS I HAVE TO USE THE AUX JACK TO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC SINCE THERE S NO FILES ACTUALLY STORED IN THE PHONE BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO JUST CONNECT THE USB STOW MY PHONE IN THE CENTER CONSOLE T 
I ONLY RATE IT HIGH BECAUSE I HAVE THE ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE BELOW AVERAGE FOR FEELING OF SAFETY AND OVERALL RATING 
I ONLY USE FOR MUSIC AND PHONE
I ONLY USE IT BECAUSE IT S THERE BUT I DO NOT NEED IT DELETE IT AND I WOULD BE JUST AS HAPPY 
I ONLY USE MY PHONE CONNECTED THRU BLUETOOTH IT SEEMS AS IF THERE IS MANY GLITCHES WHEN THE PHONE IS CONNECTED THRU THE USB PORT 
I ONLY USE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WHICH I REALLY LIKE I DON T USE OTHERS APPLICATIONS SO I CAN T COMMENT

I ONLY USE THE FM SITE OR A CD 
I ONLY USE THE RADIO AND NOTHING ELSE THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DONT USE SELECTION
I ONLY USE THE RADIO BUT IT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD AND CLEAR 
I ONLY USE THE RADIO OR CELLPHONE VIA BLUETOOTH 
I ONLY USE THE SATELLITE RADIO I HAVE NOT USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET
I ONLY UTILIZE THE RADIO SYSTEM HOWEVER IT SEEMS YOU HAVE TO TURN THE VOLUME UP HIGHER IF YOU ARE LISTENING YO A TALK SHOW SINCE IT IS HARD TO HEAR THEM GONE SAME WOULD BE FOR MUSIC BUT I WOULD PREFER THAT TO BE MORE BACKGROUND 
I OPTED FOR NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND I WISH I HAD!
I OPTED FOR THE BASE SYSTEM IT S FINE BUT OTHER BRANDS HAVE BETTER BASE SYSTEMS PORSCHE SHOULD DO BETTER HERE FOR THE COST 
I OR MY WIFE CAN USE THE SYSTEM WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS 
I ORDERED THE TOW MIRRORS AND LIKE THEM BETTER THAN STANDARD 
I ORIGINALLY CHOSE THE X3 BECAUSE OF THE EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW 
I ORIGINALLY CONNECTED MY CELLPHONES VIA THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM IN THE CAR HOWEVER PEOPLE SAY THEY CAN T UNDERSTAND ME SO I USUALLY DISCONNECT FROM THE CAR SOUND SYSTEM TO SPEAK ON THE PHONE INSTEAD I USE APPLE EAR BUDS 
I OWED A 1985 500 SEL FOR ALMOST 20 YRS AND REALLY APPRECIATED THE EXTRA MIDDLE SUN VISOR SINCE I LIVE IN SOUTHWEST FL FOR 7 MONTHS IT WOULD BE HELPFUL RATHER THAN GETTING HEAVY TINTING APPLIED WHICH TO ME LOOKS A LITTLE TACKY ON THIS BEAUTIFUL 
I OWED A 2011 GRAND CHEROKEE BEFORE BUYING THIS NEW 2015 AND MY HUSBAND AND I ARE BOTH VERY PLEASED WITH THE IMPROVED FEATURES THAT THE 2015 HAVE AND THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE HANDS FREE PHONE AND LOVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DID NOT HAVE THIS ON THE 
I OWN A 2008 PASSAT AND THAT CAME WITH TWO VISORS ON EACH SIDE ONE VISOR FOR THE FRONT AND ONE FOR THE SIDE WINDOW THE VISORS ON MY PASSAT ALSO NAVE A PULL OUT THAT CAN EXTEND THE LENGTH OF THE VISOR TO COMPLETELY BLOCK THE SUN I FEEL THAT 
I OWN A 2012 CHEVY CRUZE WITH HANDS FREE TECHNOLOGY THE CRUZE S HANDS FREE FEATURE IS HEAD AND SHOULDERS BETTER THAN THE NEW EQUINOX S THE EQUINOX LOSES CALLS IS EXTREMELY LOUD WHILE DIALING AND OFTEN FORGETS THE BLUETOOTH PHONES 
I OWN A 2013 ACCORD TOURING THAT BLOWS THE 2015 PILOT OUT OF THE BALLPARK W SAFETY FEATURES NOTE THAT MY PILOT IS ALSO A TOURING 
I OWN A 2013 MINI COOPER AS WELL IT WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS A AIDE VISOR FOR THE DRIVER THAT THEY COULD FLIP DOWN INSTEAD OF USING THE FRONT ONE 
I OWN ONE OF THE MOST AVERAGE BASIC VEHICLES IN THIS LINE OF VANS SO THERE ISN T MUCH THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE WAY OF IMPROVEMENT 
I OWN ONLY JEEP EVEN IF WAS JUNK I WOULD STILL BUY IT
I OWNED ABOUT 35 FORDS SINCE 1957 AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH ANY OF THEM BUT THIS 2015 F 150 KING RANCH IS FANTASTIC I LOVE IT 
I PAID $500 EXTRA FOR BOSE SPEAKERS THIS IS THE WORST RADIO SOUNDING RADIO I VE HEARD IN 20 YEARS VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!
I PAID $6K EXTRA FOR THE BANG AND OLUFSEN SOUND SYSTEM THE MIDRANGE AND MID VOLUME USE OF THIS SYSTEM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT 
I PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO SIGN UP FOR MBRACE AND WHEN I TRIED TO USE IT HAVE THEM LOAD A LOCATION INTO MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM THEY SAID THAT WAS NOT PART OF MY PLAN SERIOUSLY I CAN JUST ASK MY CELL PHONE TO GET ME DIRECTIONS EASIER THAN I CAN USE 
I PAID EXTRA FOR A BOSE SOUND SYSTEM AND IT SOUND AVERAGE AT BEST NOT IMPRESSED MY JETTA HAD MUCH BETTER SOUND QUALITY
I PAID FOR THE UPGRADED BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIO SYSTEM I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CAR AUDIO NUT SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF MY OVERALL VEHICLE EXPERIENCE THE SOUND SYSTEM IS GOOD BUT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED BETTER SOUND QUALITY THE SYSTEM IS 
I PARTICULARLY DON T LIKE THE LOW HEAD ROOM WHEN GETTING INTO THE JEEP AND TO ME I DON T THE GAS MILEAGE IS THAT GREAT
I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE ACCURACY OF THE GPS NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM 
I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE VISABILITY AND 18 WHEELS WHICH GIVE A STOUT RIDE EXCELLENT GROUND CLEARANCE AND SUPHERB EASE OF ENTRY AND EXIT
I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE PHONE AND RADIO QUALITY 
I PERSONALLY DO NOT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN WHEN YOU EXIT YOUR VEHICLE THE DASH AREA LOOKS LIKE A PLAY SCHOOL EVENT TURNING THE KNOB TO SELECT OR CHANGE A STATION IS CLEANER AND SIMPLER 
I PERSONALLY FEEL THERE IS A RATHER LARGE BLIND SPOT
I PERSONALLY FIND THE IDRIVE SYSTEM TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE TO USE ONCE YOU GET OVER THE INITIAL SMALL LEARNING CURVE WHILE DRIVING THIS IS NOT BMW S NEWEST GENERATION IDRIVE SYSTEM THE Z4 IS ONE GENERATION OLDER YET IT IS STILL ONE OF THE BE 
I PERSONALLY THINK THE SUN VISORS ARE TOO SMALL TO BE EFFECTIVE IN BLOCKING THE SUN 
I PERSONALLY WOULD RATHER MY JEEP TO SIT HIGHER LIKE AN SUV I FEEL LIKE I SIT AT CAR LEVEL 
I PHONE 5 INTERFACE IS HORRIBLE THE UCONNECT UPDATE TAKES TO LONG SO YOU CAN NOT SEE YOUR ORGANIZED PLAYLISTS TO SELECT AND PLAY MUSIC EASILY 
I PHONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WITH CONTACT LIST ETC IS VERY GOOD 
I PHONE SYNC FOR MUSIC
I PHYSICALLY LOOK TO BOTH SIDES & BEHIND WHEN CHANGING LANES I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER TO SEE IF IT IS SAFE TO CHANGE I HAVE TO RELY ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS WHICH CAN CREATE A BLIND SPOT 
I PLACE THE STEERING WHEEL HIGHER THAN I LIKE IN ORDER TO SEE THE INSTRUMENT PANEL COMPLETELY 
I POD I PAD AND I PHONE PLUS XM IS COOL 
I POD RE LOADS EVERY TIME YOU TURN VEHICLE OFF RENTAL 2015 CAMRY DID NOT AND IT MADE THE I POD MUCH EASIER TO USE 
I PREFER BLUETOOTH TO USING CABLES ESPECIALLY CABLES IN THE GLOVE BOX IT JUST SEEMS OUTDATED 
I PREFER GARMIN NAVIGATION SYSTEMS VOICE RECOGNITION FOR DESTINATION NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE TO BE FAIR I DON T USE THE NAVIGATION VERY MUCH I LOVE MY RADIO ! MY IPOD IS SO OLD IT WON T WORK IN THIS CAR EVEN WITH A USB CONNECTION 
I PREFER MY FREESTANDING GARMIN OVER THE FACTORY NAVAGATION
I PREFER RAIN SENSOR AND AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS 
I PREFER SIDE TO SIDE WIPERS
I PREFER THE INTEGRATED CONTROL SCREEN LIKE ON MY 535I BUT I UNDERSTAND THESE NEWER SCREENS ARE THE FREE FLOATING TYPE I DON T CARE FOR THIS STYLE AS MUCH 
I PREFER THE LITTLE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS RATHER THEN THE AUTOMATIC BLIND SPOT LIGHT 
I PREFER THE OLD FASHIONED BUTTON TO CHANGE STATIONS ON THE RADIO 
I PREFER THE SLIDING SUN VISORS RATHER THAN THE ADJUSTABLE PULL OUT VISOR EXTENSIONS 
I PREFER THE VISIBILITY TO MY PREVIOUS SUBARU DIFFERENT MODEL 
I PREFER TO NOT USE ANY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM ETC SO THAT I CAN FOCUS ON MY DRIVING I HAVE TAKEN MANY ADVANCED CORVETTE DRIVING SCHOOLS AND SAFE DRIVING CALLS FOR A SINGLE FOCUS DRIVING 
I PREFER TO USE A GARMIN NAVIGATION DEVICE TO THE ITEM IN THE CAR BECAUSE I AM STILL LEARNING TO USE THE DRIVING FEATURES OF THE VEHICLE BEFORE FOCUSING ON THE 3 SYSTEMS ABOVE 
I PREFER TOUCH SCREEN NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A LITTLE TOUGH TO UNDERSTAND STILL LEARNING ON HOW TO USE IT
I PREFER ZENON HEAD LAMPS
I PREFERRED THE TOUCH SCREEN WITH PROGRAMMING THE RADIO THE MOUSE IS VERY TOUCHY SO CAN BE FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES 
I PRETTY MUCH USE SIRIUS XM EXCLUSIVELY AND LISTEN MOSTLY TO SPORTS AND MUSIC SO I HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO GIVE YOU DESCRIPTIVE ASPECTS OF THE OTHER FEATURES 
I PREVIOUS EXPLAINED THE REASON FOR MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT DOES NOT GO DEEP ENOUGH IF YOU NOT IN A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT VOICE COMMUNICATION I QUIT USING IT PAIRING OF EXTERNAL EQUIPMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE DONE MULTIPLE TIME MY OPINIO 
I PREVIOUSLY EXPLAINED UNDER THINGS GONE WRONG MY LIKES AND DISLIKES 
I PREVIOUSLY HAD A 2012 MINI COOPER AND THIS MODEL DOESN T HAVE THE BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING TO CHANGE LANES TO THE LEFT
I PREVIOUSLY HAD A TOYOTA SOLARA CONVERTIBLE WHEN THE TOP WAS UP IT WAS VERY POOR TO SEE OUT THE BACK MY CAMARO IS EXCELLENT!
I PREVIOUSLY OWNED A 2012 BMW X5 AND LIKED THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS BETTER THAN THIS 2015 X5 IT WAS MUCH EASIER TO CHANGE CHANNELS IN MY OLDER X5 
I PREVIOUSLY OWNED A GTI AND GOLF R THE NEW GTI IS A PLEASURE TO DRIVE AND THE SEATS AND INTERIOR FINISH ARE EXCELLENT 
I PREVIOUSLY OWNED AN INFINITI M35X THAT HAD A MUCH LARGER REAR VIEW MIRROR THAN THE CADILLAC AND I PREFER THE INFINITI MIRROR RATHER THAN THE CADILLAC I THINK CADILLAC S MIRROR SHOULD BE LARGER ALSO THE INFINITI HAD TWO FRONT DRIVER SUN VISORS 
I PREVIOUSLY STATED ABOUT THE REAR VISIBILITY BEING A BIT POOR>
I PRIMARILY USE THE ON STAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN NECESSARY
I PROBABLY NEED A LESSON IN THE USE OF THE VARIOUS MORE SOPHISTICATED FEATURES TO FULLY JUDGE THEM
I PROBABLY NEED TO INVEST MORE TIME LEARNING THE SYSTEM BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO! TUNING DIRECTLY TO SPECIFIC CHANNELS DOES NOT SEEM EASY IF WE DID LONG JOURNEYS THEN I WOULD MAKE THE INVESTMENT IN LEARNING THE SYSTEM BETTER BUT IT S AN ELECTR 
I PURCHASED A HIGH ALTITUDE VEHICLE AND WAS DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LACK OF FEATURES AVAILABLE IN THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED SATELLITE RADIO AND NAVIGATION BUT THIS VEHICLE DIDN T HAVE THAT OPTION I THINK FOR THE HIGH ALTIT 
I PURCHASED A LOW END VEHICLE SO IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY SPECIAL AUDIO OPTIONS BUT I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT I DON T EVEN HAVE A CD PLAYER RADIO ONLY 
I PURCHASED IT FOR THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE CAPABILITY AS I TOW A JET SKI 
I PURCHASED THE ADDITIONAL DRIVERS ASSIST BLIND SPOT/COLLISION WARNING BECAUSE OF THE SMALL BACK WINDOW WITH THAT ADDITION I FEEL TOTALLY SAFE IN THE VEHICLE 
I PURCHASED THE AUTO DIMMING EXTERIOR MIRRORS IT WORKS GREAT EXCEPT THERE IS ABOUT 1/4 INCH AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE MIRROR THAT IS NOT COVERED WITH THE AUTO DIMMING MATERIAL SO WHEN CARS DRIVE PAST YOU THEIR LIGHTS STILL BLIND YOU BRIEFLY 
I PURCHASED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR THE 2014 MODEL IT STUNK WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE UPDATED ONLY ONCE IN FOUR YEARS THAT WAS INCORRECT BUT THE UPDATING INTERVAL STILL WAS TOO LONG I NOW USE IPAD APS FOR NAVIGATION ON THE 2015 AND HAVE ABSOLU 
I PURCHASED THE OPTION WITH A SAFETY SYSTEM THAT MUST BE MANUALLY TURNED ON EVERY TIME AND THIS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY ON IF I LEAVE IT ON 
I PURCHASED THE UPGRADED AUDIO PACKAGE AND FIND IT REALLY MEDIOCRE A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
I PURCHASED THE WI FI PACKAGE TO HAVE BUILT IN WI FI AT ALL TIMES THROUGH GM IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET VIA PHONE OR OTHER DEVICES THROUGH THE BUILT IN WI FI I CONNECT AND MY DEVICES CONSTANTLY JUST SPIN I AM NOT HAPPY W 
I PURCHASED THIS CAR IN ORDER TO FEEL SAFE WHEN DRIVING AROUND LARGE VEHICLES WHICH TEXAS IS KNOWN FOR IT EXCEEDS THOSE EXPECTATIONS 
I PURCHASED THIS CAR OVER ANOTHER DUE TO GOOD VISIBILITY FEEL THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN DRIVING AS MUCH AS I DO
I PUT 2 EXTRA CUSION IN THE DRIVER SEAT TO MAKE ME HIGH AND EASY FOR ME TO SEE OUTSIDE
I PUT A LOT OF MP3 S ON A FLASH DRIVE AND ALWAYS HAVE MUSIC I WANT 
I PUT IN AFTER MARKET SPEAKERS AND NOW HAVE EXCELLENT SOUND AND IT MAKES ALL OF THE OPTIONSVERY USEFUL 
I PUT MY CD COLLECTION IN THE TRUCK WHEN I PURCHASED IT AND A COUPLE WEEKS AGO DECIDED TO PLAY ONE OF THEM SURPRISED TO FIND THERE IS NO CD PLAYER!
I PUT ONE IN MYSELF BUT IT COULD USE A BIGGER REAR VIEW MIRROR YOU CAN SEE ALOT MORE WITH A BIGGER MIRROR BLIND SPOTS AND ALL 
I PUT SMALL CONVEX MIRRORS ON THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS REALLY HELPED WITH VISIBILITY
I PUT THE BACK SEATS DOWN WHEN I CAN SO I CAN SEE BETTER LOOKING OUT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
I PUT THE SMALL CLOSE MIRRORS ON THE MIRRORS FOR ADDED SAFETY 
I RALLY DO NOT KNOW ALTHOUGH IT IS EQUIPPED WITH THE ON STAR SYSTEM I DON T USE IT I DO HOWEVER MAKE USE OF THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE FOR MY CELL PHONE 
I RALLY LIKE THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT WHEN BACKING UP AND THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM 
I RARELY USE ANY OF THIS EQUIPMENT I BOUGHT THIS CAR PURELY FOR THE SENSUAL DRIVING EXPERIENCE NOT FOR AUDIO OR COMMUNICATIONS 
I RARELY USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BECAUSE IT S TOO DIFFICULT TO USE I CAN NEVER GET IT TO TAKE AN ADDRESS CERTAIN NUMBERS AND LETTERS ARE BLOCKED OUT AND I CAN T GET IT TO TAKE AN ENTIRE ADDRESS THE POINTS OF INTEREST FEATURE ISN T APPEALING 
I RARELY USE THESE FUNCTIONS AND THEREFOR HAVE LITTLE OPINION FORMED 
I RATE THE SAFETY AS FANTASTIC DESPITE OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT IN WHICH I HYDROPLANED CAUGHT AIR GOING OVER A 12 + EMBANKMENT AND ROLLED 450 DEGREES A FULL SOMERSAULT FORWARD AND A QUARTER TURN ONTO THE PASSENGER SIDE I WALKED A 
I RATED AN 8 BECAUSE OF THE AUDIO AND COMMUNICATION ASPECTS OF THE CAR 
I RATED LOW BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT SYSTEM BUT VERY DIFFICULT TO LEARN TO MANY GO TO S TO GET TO THE DESIRED TASK THE INSTRUCTION BOOK IS DIFFICULT AT BEST AND NOT WRITTEN WELL I FEEL IF I AM CHANGING TASKS I NEED TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD 
I RATED THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT AS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL BUT THAT IS BECAUSE I USUALLY HAVE THE REAR SEATS DOWN WHEN THE REAR SEATS ARE UP VISIBLITY IS DRASTICALLY REDUCED ESPECIALLY IF THE HEADRESTS ARE RAISED 
I RATED THE VISIBILITY OF CHANGING LANES SO POORLY AS I M NOT A TALL WOMAN SO THE SIDE DOOR PANELS BLOCK MY LINE OF VISION AS WELL AS THE PLACEMENT OF THE SIDE MIRROR IT S SOMETHING I VE GOTTEN USED TO BUT I HAVE TO CAREFULLY VIEW AND REVIEW WH 
I RATHER BUY A GAMINS GPS FROM MARKET IS 100 TIMES BETTER THAN THE BUILT IN ONE VERY DISAPPOINTMENT FOR IT

I REALLY APPRECIATE THE BLIND SPOT LIGHTS ON THE OUTSIDE MIRROR WONDERFUL

I REALLY LOVE THIS CAR EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY GET FRUSTRATED WITH BLUETOOTH NOT UNDERSTANDING COMMAND THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT RATE THE WIPERS 10 IS BECAUSE THE FEW TIMES I HAVE USED THEM SO FAR IS A LITTLE CONFUSING WITH SLOW AND FAST SPEEDS GETTI 
I REALLY LOVE THIS FEATURE MY LAST CAR DID NOT HAVE THIS TO HAVE ALL OF THIS LOCATED IN THE VEHICLE IS AWESOME 
I REALLY MISS THE BACKUP SIGNAL AS IT WAS VERY HELPFUL I AM SHORT AND OFTEN HAVE TROUBLE SEEING TO BACK UP BECAUSE OF HEAD RESTS ON OTHER ROWS SEATS I THINK IT SHOULD BE ON ALL VEHICLES 
I REALLY MISS THE INTERNAL HARD DRIVE THAT WAS IN MY PREVIOUS INFINITI 
I REALLY MISS THE MAGNIFYING MIRROR IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR THE ORANGE LIGHT THING HAS BEEN HARD TO GET USED TO I D RATHER HAVE IT THE WAY IT WAS 
I REALLY MISS THE RIGHT SIDE CAMERA THAT COMES ON WHENEVER TURNING RIGHT WITH BLINKER ON THAT MADE BLIND SPOTS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE LOVED THAT FEATURE AND WISH THIS CAR HAD IT!
I REALLY MISS THE SMALL SIDE VIEW MIRRORS 
I REALLY NEED TO TAKE THE TIME TO FIGURE OUT THE BLUE TOOTH I M NOT GOOD WITH TECHNOLOGY
I REALLY NEED TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND 
I REALLY ONLY USE THE RADIO & MY HANDS FREE PHONE & BOTH ARE GREAT 
I REALLY ONLY USE THE SATALITE RADIO AND MOSTLY THE SAME STATION
I REALLY PREFER KNOBS AND BUTTONS WHEN I HAVE TO ADJUST VOLUME I HAVE FREQUENTLY ACCIDENTALLY TOUCHED THE SCREEN AND CHANGED THE RADIO STATION INADVERTENTLY THIS CAN BE QUITE STARTLING AND UNPLEASANT 
I REALLY REALLY REALLY WISH IT HAS A USER SELECTABLE EQUALIZER
I REALLY THINK IT IS PERFECT AS IS 
I REALLY THINK SOMETHING CAN BE BETTER DONE WITH THE SUN VISOR PROTECTION 
I REALLY WISH I COULD CONNECT THE IPOD USING THE USB CORRECTLY 
I REALLY WISH MIRRORLINK WAS ENABLED 
I REALLY WISH SOMEONE COULD FULLY EXPLAIN THE IN CONTROL PROGRAMS
I REALLY WISH THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA HAD DISTANCE MARKINGS SOMETIMES IT S DIFFICULT TO TELL HOW CLOSE I AM TO THE VEHICLE BEHIND ME IF I M PARALLEL PARKING 
I REALLY WISH THIS CAR HAD A BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM THE SLIVER OF BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR IS COMEPLETELY USELESS IT ACTUALLY GETS IN THE WAY OF SEEING CARS 
I REALY LIKE THE BUILT IN HANDS FREE PHONE CONNECTION 
I REALY LIKE THE DESIGN OF THE CAR FRONT IT LOOKS LIKE BIG CAR 
I REALY LIKE THE RIGHT TURN DISPLAY IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER EVEN THOUGH I STILL LOOK BEFORE SWITCHING LANES 
I RECOGNIZE THAT THE WINDSHIELD MUST HAVE SUPPORT ON THE SIDES BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE SIDE BARS WERE SLIGHTLY SMALLER TO ALLOW EVEN MORE VISIBILITY ON SHARP WINDING ROADS ONE MUST ADJUST ONES HEAD LEAN FORWARD TO ENSURE VISIBILITY AROUND 
I REGARD THE INSTANT RESPONSE AND ACCELERATION OF THE ELECTRIC DRIVE AS A SAFETY FEATURE FOR ONE THING IT HELPS A LOT ON THE SHORT ON RAMPS WE HAVE ON FREEWAYS IN HAWAII 
I RELY ON MY NAVY SYSTEM THE NAV SYSTEM IN MY AZERA IS EXCEPTIONALLY PRECISE AND PROVIDES FLAWLESS ADVANCE NAV NOTIFICATION THAT MAKES MY DRIVING A PLEASURE 
I RELY ON THE WARNING SIGNAL IN THE SIDE MORROWS BECAUSE I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT 
I REMOVED GPS TOM TOM DEVICE AS IT REDUCED FRONT VISIBILITY 
I REMOVED THE REAR HEADRESTS FOR GREAT REAR VISIBILITY 
I REMOVED THE REAR HEADRESTS TO INCREASE VISIBILITY I KNEW THE CONVERTIBLE WAS CRITICIZED FOR POOR REAR & SIDE VISIBILITY IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE REAR CAMERA ON LIKE IN AN RV WE CAN ALWAYS SEE BEHIND A WIDE RANGE WI 
I REMOVED THE REAR SEATING HEAD RESTS AS THEY BLOCKED MY VISION BEHIND THE VEHICLE
I REMOVED THE RIGHT REAR HEADREST TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT THIS ISSUE WITH NISSAN IS STILL NOT ADDRESSED WELL AND WE LOVE THE ROGUE EXCEPT FOR THIS PROBLEM 
I RESEARCHED THE SUV BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS ONE AND LIKE THAT IS IT TOP RATED FOR SAFETY
I SAT IN AT LEAST 50 DIFFERENT CARS AND TESTED THEIR VISIBILITY TOWARD THE BACK AND SIDES FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT AND THIS ONE WAS OF THE VERY BEST SAFETY IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN STYLING BUT THIS WAS THE CAR WITH THE BEST COMBINATION 
I SEE GREAT OUT OF MY BLIND SPOT 
I SEEM TO FIND NEW INFORMATION EVERY TIME I USE MY VEHICLE IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE HOW MUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IT IS ONLY REALLY LIMITED BY THE INDIVIGUALS KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO USE THE SYSTEMS 
I SEEM TO HAVE A CLOSED IN FEELING INSIDE THE CAR BECAUSE THERE IS MORE METAL AND LESS GLASS AROUND ME BUT THAT IS PROBABLY AN EXCELLENT SAFETY FEATURE THAT I REALLY SHOULDN T COMPLAIN ABOUT 
I SEEM TO HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING AROUND REAR HEADRESTS IN ORDER TO JUDGE SAFETY OF CHANGING LANES 
I SEEM TO HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING MY BLIND SPOT AND FELT UNCOMFORTABLE AT FIRST RELYING ON MIRROR INDICATOR COULD HAVE TO DO WITH IT BEING VERY NEW FOR ME AND NOW USING ANOTHER METHOD TO CHECK FOR CARS NOT READILY APPARENT I DO LIKE IT BETTER 
I SEEM TO HAVE SOME ISSUE LOOKING TO THE SIDE AND BACK LIKE PULLING OUT INTO AN INTERSECTION AND CHANGING LANES SOLID AREA BETWEEN BACK AND FRONT SEATS CREATES A BLIND SPOT BUT WARNING SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL AND COMPENSATES FOR THIS ISSUE WHEN JUST 
I SEEMS TO BE DOING GREAT 
I SELDOM DRIVE AT NIGHT I DO LIKE THAT I CAN HAVE THE LIGHTS SET TO AUTOMATICALLY COME ON IF IT GETS DARK BECAUSE OF HOUR OR PERHAPS WEATHER/CLOUDS THE NEEDED LIGHTS WILL TURN ON 
I SELDOM USE OTHER THAN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
I SELECTED THE WRONG RADIO WHEN I ORDERED THE NEW JEEP WRANGLER
I SET IT ONE TIME AND THAT S IT HAVEN T ADJUSTED IT SINCE 
I SET THE PRESET STATIONS SOMEHOW GOT THEM IN AND THEN TRIED TO CHANGE ONE OF THEM AND I CAN T GET THE CHANGE TASK DONE NOW HARD TO FIGURE OUT 
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CALL ANYONE FROM MY PHONE S CONTACT LIST BE USING A SIMPLE VOICE COMMAND IF THE PHONE IS CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH OR USB HOWEVER THE CONTACTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED 
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO EDIT/LOAD ADDRESSES AND PHONE NUMBERS FROM THE LEAF WEBSITE DOING IT IN THE CAR OR SYNCING WITH PHONE IS A MESS 
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY CALL PERSON S NAME ON CELL IN ONE STEP BUT INSTEAD I HAVE TO SAY DIAL AND THEN PERSON S NAME POSSIBLY THIS IS A USER ERROR BUT IT NEVER SEEMS TO WORK 
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEARCH FOR ANYTHING AND GET REASONABLE RESULTS JUST LIKE ON MY PHONE I ALWAYS KNOW WHERE I WANT TO GO BEFORE I START DRIVING AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET A ROUTE THERE QUICKLY AND EASILY THESE DAYS CONSUMERS REALLY EXPECT 
I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE PARKING SENSORS AND REAR VIEW CAMERA NEXT TIME! 
I SHOULD HAVE MY SALESPERSON GO OVER SOME THINGS WITH ME WHEN I TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER FOR IT S FIRST 5 000 MILE SERVICE I HAD TO READ THE OWNERS MANUAL TO FIGURE SOME THINGS OUT AND DIDN T KNOW IT HAD SOME FEATURES I AM MORE THAN PLEASED WI 
I SHOULD HAVE PAID THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM THE STOCK ONE IS OK BUT NOT GREAT 
I SHOULD TELL YOU THAT I HAVE ONLY ONE LEG SO REACHING TO THE RIGHT IS DIFFICULT AND THE LOCATIONS OF THE ELECTRONIC CONTROL CENTER BECOMES EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC 
I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE SIDE ASSIST WARNING LIGHTS AND THE FRONT ASSIST NORMALLY I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THEM IF THEY WERE AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE BUT NOW THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED THEM THEY WILL BE A REQUIREMENT ON ANY NEW VEHICLE I ORDER 
I SIT A JUST THE RIGHT HEIGHT TO HAVE GREAT VISION OF MY SURROUNDINGS AND THE WINDOWS ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE GOOD SIGHT OF OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE 
I SIT TOO LOW IN THE DIVERS SEAT I HAVE THE ELECTRIC SEAT AS HIGH AS IT CAN GO MORE PADDING IN THE DRIVER S SEAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
I SIT UP HIGH ENOUGH TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON ALL AROUND ME I WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT INFORMATION SYSTEM VISIBILITY IS GREAT 
I SIT WITH THE SEAT FURTHER BACK THAN MOST AND THE CENTER DOOR PILLAR SLIGHTLY BLOCKS PERIPHERAL VISION 
I SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE BLOCKING A CRITICAL LINE OF SIGHT 
I SOMETIMES HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING THE CAR DIRECTLY BEHIND ME WHEN CHANGING LANES 
I SOMETIMES HAVE TO PLUG IN MY IPHONE 2 OR 3 TIMES BEFORE IT THE CAR IS ABLE TO READ THE MUSIC FILES
I SPECIAL ORDERED THIS VEHICLE TO ENSURE THE EYE SIGHT SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED THE BLIND SPOT WARNING IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE A SOUND ALONG WITH THE WARNING LIGHT IN THE SIDE MIRROR WOULD BE THE HELPFUL 
I SPECIFICALLY DID NOT WANT THE TOUCH NAVIGATION SCREEN AND I M HAPPY WITH THIS DECISION 
I SPEND NEARLY 90 MINUTES/DAY IN THE CAR I LISTEN TO CD S AM TALK RADIO AND SIRIUS I FEEL ENTERTAINED TO THE POINT I DON T MIND DRIVING AND WHEN A PHONE CALL COMES IN THE MUSIC IS MUTED AND I TAKE THE CALL THROUGH THE AUDIO 
I SPENT EXTRA FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I HAVE HAD IT ON MY OTHER FORDS AND I AM VERY COMFORTABLE WITH THE WAY THEY WORK FOR ME BEING ABLE TO POP AN ADDRESS INTO THE DEVICE AND HAVE ACCURATE REAL TIME VOICE DIRECTIONS IS A BIG CONFIDENCE BOOST 
I STATED THIS EARLIER 
I STILL CAN T FIGURE OUT DESPITE READING BOOK HOW TO LISTEN TO MY IPOD 
I STILL CANNOT CONNECT TO AHA 
I STILL CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON MUTE IT S VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN LISTENING TO SOMETHING ON THE STEREO TO HAVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CONTINUALLY DECREASING THE VOLUME WHEN I DON T WANT TO HEAR THE NAVIGATION VOICE ANYW 
I STILL DON T UNDERSTAND HOW THE TRAFFIC INFORMATION WORKS
I STILL FIGURING IT OUT AND EXPLORING ALL THE FEATURES
I STILL GET NERVOUS DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND ESPECIALLY NEAR 18 WHEELERS BUT THE ABILITY TO SPEED UP AND CHANGE LANES FAST IS A PLUS!
I STILL HAVE DIFFICULTIES COMMUNICATING WITH NAVIGATION 
I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET VOICE COMMAND TO WORK WITH MY IPHONE 6 PLUS
I STILL HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO USE ANY OF THE APPS IN MY CAR BECAUSE IT KEEPS GIVING ME AN ERROR MESSAGE 
I STILL HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS IT S NEVER BEEN OPERATIONAL YOU COULD TEST THE SYSTEMS BEFORE YOU SELL THE CARS AND MAKE SURE THE INTERNET HOT SPOT AND NAVIGATION ARE WORKING I DON T THINK THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO ASK 
I STILL HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE HANDS FREE CALLING I VE CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH BUT DON T GET ANY SOUNDS SHOULD BE EASIER TO FIGURE OUT 
I STILL HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE MOST OF THESE SYSTEMS
I STILL NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE VOICE COMMANDS I AM NOT AS TECHNICAL AS SOME PEOPLE BUT THIS IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT KIA S
I STILL NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE SYSTEM IT HAS MANY FEATURES I AM STILL NOT AWARE OF 
I STILL USE MY IPAD FOR DESTINATIONS SINCE THE ON BOARD SYSTEM IS CUMBERSOME AND SOMEWHAT INACCURATE THE SCREEN IS SMALL AND I HAVE FOUND SOME ADDRESSES TO BE UNAVAILABLE AS NOT ALL LETTERS AND NUMBERS APPEAR WHEN TYPING THEM IN I USE THE NAVI 
I STILL WORRY THAT A SMALL CAR IS NOT SAFE BUT HONDA HAS IMPROVED THE FIT I HOPE 
I STRUGGLE WITH THE CONNECTION OF MY IPHONE I HAVE SPECIFIED THE ISSUE IN ANOTHER COMMENT 
I SUGGEST YOU JUST USE A BETTER SOUND SYSTEM
I SURVIVED A 50/50 HEAD ON IN A VEHICLE IDENTICAL TO MY NEW KIA I DIDN T HESITATE TO BUY ANOTHER
I SUSPECT THAT IF MY REAR SPEAKERS ARE WORKING PROPERLY IT WOULD BE THE AUDIO SYSTEM I LIKE THE MOST IF I AM WRONG ABOUT THE SPEAKERS NOT WORKING THEN I MAY CHANGE MY MIND ABOUT THE SPEAKER QUALITY 
I SUSPECT THAT THE SPEAKERS NEED TO BE IMPROVED THE SYSTEM MUST BE PLAYED AT A HIGHER VOLUME AT FREEWAY SPEEDS TO HEAR THE SOUND CLEARLY 
I SWITCHED TO A SUBARU BECAUSE OF THE SUBARU S REPUTATION FOR SAFETY AND RELIABILITY 
I TAKE ALL MY CONFERENCE CALLS VIA BLUETOOTH CONNECTION THE CALLS ARE MORE CLEAR THAT WHEN I USE A HEADSET I CAN ALSO ANSWER CALLS THE SAME WAY VERY EASY TO USE 
I TEND TO ALWAYS HEAR THAT PEOPLE ON THE OTHER CALL CAN T HEAR ME HOWEVER I CAN HEAR THEM PERFECTLY 
I TEND TO LOOK OVER MY SHOULDERS WHEN I CHANGE LANES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT I DON T JUST RELY ON MY SIDE MIRRORS 
I TEND TO NOT USE THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE AND LANE DEPARTURE SYSTEMS AND WOULD PREFER TO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM
I TEST DROVE A TESLA AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR LARGE TOUCH SCREEN 
I TEST DROVE ABOUT FOUR VEHICLES AND THIS ONE HAD THE BEST VISIBILITY WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY I BOUGHT THIS CAR I ALSO ENJOY THE BACKUP CAMERA AND I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A FUNCTION TO VIEW BEHIND THE CAR THROUGH THE BACK UP CAMERA WHILE DRIVING 
I TEST DROVE MANY EQUAL SIZED VEHICLES AND FOUND THE VISIBILITY OF THE BUICK REGAL WAS THE BEST THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I CHOSE THIS VEHICLE TO LEASE 
I THINK A DISPLAY DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER WOULD ADD SAFETY AND EASE OF USE 
I THINK A SMALL BLINDSPOT MIRROR SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ON THE OUTSIDE DRIVERS MIRROR MUCH LIKE IS ON THE FORD FUSION ON I DRIVE FOR MY COMPANY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE TOP RIGHT CORNER OF OUTSIDE DRIVERS MIRROR 
I THINK ACURA GETS THAT A PHONE AND THE ELECTRONICS IN THE CAR SHOULD RELATE WELL WITH EACH OTHER AND HAVE THOUGHT OF JUST ABOUT EVERY WAY TO CONNECT THIS IS THE SECOND ELS ACURA SYSTEM I HAVE HAD AND THE 5 1 CHANNELS DELIVER SUPERB SOUND AND EF 
I THINK ALL ASPECTS OF THE VEHICLE S SYSTEM IS EXCEPTIONAL 
I THINK ALL BIGGER VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE SENSORY VISIBILTY ASSISTANCE THERE ARE MANY BLIND APOTS IN THIS VEHICLE AND I HAVE TO TURN ALL THE WAY AROUND TO SEE VEHICLES BESIDE ME 
I THINK ALL CARS SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH LANE CHANGE MONITORING I FIND IT EXCEPTIONAL 
I THINK ALL MODELS AND MINE IS THE BASE MODEL OUGHT TO COME WITH BACK UP CAMERA TO GET THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD CAR PAYMENTS I COULDN T AFFORD I DON T THINK THAT SAFETY IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO HAVE NEXT STEP UP WOULD 
I THINK ALL THE CONTROLS ARE TOO CLOSE TOGETHER
I THINK AN EASY AND HELPFUL ADDITION WOULD BE A BLINKER ON THE SIDE MIRRORS 
I THINK BUTTONS ARE EASIER TO USE WHILE DRIVING THIS WAY YOU CAN FEEL IT INSTEAD OF LOOKING AWAY FROM THE ROAD 
I THINK FOR THE PRICE POINT OF THE VEHICLE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED INSTEAD OF THE ON STAR NAVIGATION SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED A MAP OF THE AREA YOU ARE IN SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO STOP PULL OUT YOUR PHON 
I THINK I AM GETTING WHAT WAS PAID FOR THIS ISNOT AN EXPENSIVE AUTOMOBILE 
I THINK I AM SEEING OTHER VEHICLES BETTER PARTICULARLY OUT THE SIDES 
I THINK I DO NOT LIKE MULTIPLE CLICKS AND I ALSO I DID NOT UPGRADE THE AUDIO SYSTEM 
I THINK I HAD BETTER SIDE MIRROR VISIBILITY IN MY 09 VENZA
I THINK I HAVE ALWAYS DRIVEN SAFE VEHICLES SO IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO SAY THAT THIS TOYOTA SURPASSES MY VOLVO OR HONDA 
I THINK I JUST NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE CONTROLS A BIT MORE EFFECTIVELY 
I THINK I LIKE THE BOSE SOUND SYSTEM THE BEST THE SUBWOOFER GIVES OUT NICE LOW TONE WITHOUT BEING TOO THUMPING EVEN AT THE HIGHEST SETTING PLUS THE INFOTAINMENT SCREEN IS REALLY EASY TO USE OR SELECTING DIFFERENT SETTINGS 
I THINK I NEED A TUTORIAL 
I THINK I REALLY LOVE THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PHONE THE CALLS COME THROUGH VERY CLEAR AND THE PEOPLE I AM TALKING TO NEVER COMPLAIN ABOUT POOR SOUND QUALITY ON THEIR END 
I THINK I WOULD PREFER TOUCH SCREEN ON THE WHOLE SYSTEM 
I THINK I WOULD USE IT S FULL CAPABILITY BUT PAYING PAYING PAYING FOR WIFI IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN!!! WHAT A WASTE YOU COULD SAVE COSTS FOR THE CUSTOMER TO GIVE THEM THE CHOICE WHETHER THEY WANT TO PAY EXTRA OR NOT AND DOWNGRADE THE EQUIPMENT THE 
I THINK IF I HAD A BETTER INSTRUCTION COURSE WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE OF HOW TO USE ALL THE OPTIONS OR AT LEAST THE MOST COMMON ONES THAT I WOULD ENJOY THIS SYSTEM A WHOLE LOT BETTER
I THINK IF IT WERE A LITTLE WIDER IT WOULD HOLD THE ROAD BETTER IT ISN T AS GOOD IN THE SNOW AS MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE 
I THINK IT CAN USE SLIGHTLY WIDER MIRRORS OR POSSIBLY VERY SLIGHTLY CURVED MIRRORS BUT THIS IS PROBABLY MY PREFERENCE I LIKE TO SET MY MIRRORS SO I CAN SEE A LITTLE OF THE SIDE OF MY VEHICLE AND AS MUCH OF TRAFFIC AS POSSIBLE IT S A LITTLE DI 
I THINK IT HANDLES PRETTY GOOD 
I THINK IT HAS REALLY NICE FEATURES SOME OF THE BUGS JUST NEED TO BE WORKED OUT OF THE BLUETOOTH TROUBLES CONNECTING AND THEN I WOULD GIVE IT A 9 OR 10 
I THINK IT IS KIND OF HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE SIDE WINDOWS WHEN PULLING OUT OF A PARKING LOT 
I THINK IT IS TRULY AMAZING I LOVE IT!!!
I THINK IT IS WELL DESIGNED AND EASY TO USE 
I THINK IT MIGHT BE DRIVING NOISE BUT MANY PEOPLE CAN T HEAR ME CLEARLY IF I AM SPEAKING THROUGH HANDS FREE 
I THINK IT NEEDS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS THE PANEL IS BIGGER IS BETER 
I THINK IT ONE OF THE SAFEST CARS ON THE ROAD BECAUSE OF THE CHASSIS CONFIGURATION 
I THINK IT S ALL JUST CONFUSING I DID READ SOME OF THE OWNER S MANUAL REGARDING THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND I DID LEARN SOME TIPS FROM THAT BUT IT S STILL CONFUSING OVERALL 
I THINK IT S PRETTY GOOD JUST HOW IT IS
I THINK IT S SAD THAT I USE MY IPHONE FOR NAVIGATION OVER THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION IN THE NX REASON BEING THE SYSTEM ISN T EASY TO USE WHEN I M DRIVING I LIKE SOMETHING SIMPLE I USE NAVIGATION FOR MORE THAN JUST DIRECTION I SEARCH FOR POINTS O 
I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE A LIL MORE BASS ITS SOUNDS HORRIBLE & I LOVE MY MUSIC & HAVING IT LOUD IT GOES TO 38 & SOUNDS LIKE THE SPEAKERS ARE BUST 
I THINK IT WILL ALWAYS BE HARD TO HEAR PHONE CALLS ON SPEAKERS ESPECIALLY IF I M ON SPEAKER AND THE PERSON I M TALKING TO IS ON SPEAKER AND WE ARE BOTH DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD 
I THINK IT WILL BE REALLY HELPFUL WHEN I FINALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT I WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND MY SECOND DATE FOR A REFRESHER COURSE DUE TO AN ILLNESS IN MY FAMILY 
I THINK IT WOULD BE HARD TO BACKUP WITHOUT REAR CAMERA 
I THINK ITS FINE PEOPLE SHOULD FOCUS ON DRIVING NOT WHAT MUSIC THEY WANT FROM WHERE 
I THINK MAKING THE INSTRUCTION PROMPTS MORE USER FRIENDLY EASIER TO UNDERSTAND 
I THINK MERCEDES IS FALLING BEHIND LESSER MANUFACTURERS IN PROVIDING STANDARD SAFETY FEATURES ON THEIR CARS THE AUTO STOPPING FEATURE LANE DEPARTURE BLIND SPOT WARNING ETC SHOULD BE STANDARD BY THE WAS SO SHOULD ALL HISTRIONIC FEATURES I CO 
I THINK MY KIA SOUL HAS A SOUND SYSTEM THAT ADJUSTS FOR NOISE AND THIS ONE DOES NOT I GUESS THAT
I THINK MY PHONE IS OLDER IPHONE 4 AND WON T CONNECT PROPERLY????/
I THINK NAV SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE BEST I VE SEEN 
I THINK NISSAN DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB WITH THIS VEHICLE MY ONLY COMPLAINT OR SUGGESTION IS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM OFFER LIGHT TRUCK TIRES OR TRUE OFF ROAD TIRES I PURCHASED THE PRO 4X MODEL WHICH CAME WITH AGGRESSIVE TREAD P RATED TIRES PUL 
I THINK OVERALL THIS IS THE STRONGEST PART OF THE LINCOLN MKC EXPERIENCE
I THINK REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL MY OLD LEXUS WAS MUCH BETTER AND BIGGER 
I THINK SOME OF THE FORDS HAVE A 2 PART OUTSIDE MIRROR THAT HELPS TO SHOW CARS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THAT FEATURE
I THINK SOMEONE SHOULD DESIGN A THING THAT WOULD HELP WITH PARKING FORWARD IN A TIGHT URBAN GARAGE ENTERING MY GARAGE DOOR IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE WHERE AS EXITING IT BACKING OUT IS MADE EASY WITH THE REAR CAMERA SOME SORT OF THING THAT WOULD 
I THINK THAT ALL CARS SHOULD HAVE BUILT IN BLIND SIDE INDICATORS
I THINK THAT DAY RUNNING LIGHTS SHOULD BE INSTALLED ON THE SEL MODELS
I THINK THAT I AM STILL TOO NEW TO THE VEHICLE TO COMMENT WHOLLY ON THIS 
I THINK THAT IT IS ALRIGHT DON T NECESSARILY THINK IT IS EXCEPTIONAL BUT IT IS OK 
I THINK THAT LEXUS SHOULD OFFER AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT THE BSM LANCE DEPARTURE ALERT AND PARKING ASSIST YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO UPGRADE AND THEY DON T OFFER MANY OPTIONAL PACKAGES AS STAND ALONE FEATURES THUS REQUIRING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE C 
I THINK THAT THE ABILITY OF SPEAKING YOUR TEXT MESSAGE RESPONSES SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE I DO NOT THINK I SHOULD HAVE TO PAY EXTRA FOR THAT HANDS FREE DRIVING IS A LAW NOW 
I THINK THAT THE ON/OFF BUTTON FOR THE AUDIO IS TOO CLOSE TO THE PARK BUTTON 
I THINK THAT THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AS WELL AS THE VEHICLE WARNING SIGNALS AND SLOW DOWN ARE VERY IMPORTANT FACTORS IN WHY I LIKE MY SUBARU SO MUCH 
I THINK THAT THE REGULAR AUDIO SYSTEM IS NOT OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY THE OPTION MARK LEVINSON WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HOWEVER IT IS NOT IMPORTANT FOR ME SINCE I USUALLY PREFER HEARING THE SOUND OF THE ENGINE 
I THINK THAT THE SUN VISOR SHOULD LONGER OR HAVE SWAY TO KEEP SUN OUT MOREN
I THINK THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM SHOULD BE IMPROVED BECAUSE IT ALWAYS HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING MY COMMANDS 
I THINK THE BACK UP WARNING SENSOR SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL INFINITIES OUR 2013 HAD A CAMERA AND WARNING SENSOR THIS 2015 ONLY HAS THE CAMERA I MISS IT 
I THINK THE BAR BETWEEN THE DOOR AND WINDOW SOMETIMES CAUSING DIFFICULTY WHEN TRYING TO SEE IF THERE IS A CAR COMING ON THE PASSENGER SIDE
I THINK THE BASE MODEL SHOULD HAVE BETTER SPEAKERS 
I THINK THE BLUETOOTH QUALITY IS AVERAGE THE CALLS ARE ALWAYS MUFFLED A BIT HARD TO UNDERSTAND ETC AT THAT POINT I DON T EVEN BOTHER WITH THE VOICE COMMANDS BECAUSE THE BLUETOOTH TALKING ON THE PHONE IS HARD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE OTHER PER 
I THINK THE BLUTOOTH SPEAKER STRENGTH COULD BE IMPROVED I DO NOT LIKE HOW THE CAR GIVES ME ALERTS FOR UPCOMING ROAD CONDITIONS THAT I CAN T SEEM TO FIND A WAY TO TURN OFF FOR EXAMPLE TOLL BOOTH AHEAD SOMETIMES I FIND THE TOUCHSCREEN A LIT 
I THINK THE CD SYSTEM IS EASIER TO USE THE 2012 MODEL
I THINK THE COLORS/BRIGHTNESS OF THE TOUCH SCREEN IS TOO MUCH THE COLORS ARE POOR CHOICE
I THINK THE DISPLAY COULD HAVE A MORE GRAPHIC LOOK TO IT
I THINK THE DISPLAY NEEDS TO BE MORE APPEALING IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A SYSTEM IN A LUXURY VEHICLE 
I THINK THE DISPLAY OF THE CONSOLE CAN BE IMPROVED A LOT MEANING NAVIGATION OR ANYTHING DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE IT BELONGS IN AN OLDER MODEL AND GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT IT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED IT DOESN T LOOK LIKE SOM 
I THINK THE DISTANCE OF THE LOW BEAMS COULD BE FURTHER
I THINK THE DOOR MIRRORS SHOULD HAVE A BUILT IN BLIND SPOT MIRROR AS A STANDARD INSTALL
I THINK THE ENTERTAINMENT SOUND SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER MY 2010 FORTE SOUNDED BETTER 
I THINK THE FACTORY AUDIO IS AT THE LEAST UNDESIREABLE DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM> SOUNDS CHEAP 
I THINK THE FRONT SIDE WINDOW IS A BIT SMALL HARD TO LOOK OUT OF PASSENGER SIDE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A PASSENGER IS INT FRONT 
I THINK THE FRONT WINDSHIELD CORNER TRIM SHOULD BE MUCH NARROWER THAN IT IS CURRENTLY I FEEL IT S REALLY WIDE AND IMPAIRS DRIVERS TURNING VISION
I THINK THE GRAPHICS NEED TO BE UPDATED 
I THINK THE HEADLIGHTS ARE FANTASTIC FAR REACHING WITH EXCELLENT SIDE TO SIDE COVERAGE BETTER THAN MY 2011 G37 INFINITI I FEEL IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT A TOP OF THE LINE VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE RAIN SENSING WIPERS DITTO FOR THE INFINITI BOTH 
I THINK THE HEADLIGHTS WILL BE FINE AFTER THEY ARE ADJUSTED 
I THINK THE INTERFACE/CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE 
I THINK THE LOOK OF THE SCREEN FONT COLORS IS LACKING I WISH THERE WAS NOT A DELAY OF TRANSMISSION WHEN PLAYING AUDIO FROM PHONE TO SPEAKERS 
I THINK THE MAP WILL BE THE MOST USEFUL BUT I TRULY ENJOY USING HAVING THE PHONE TALK TO ME!
I THINK THE MIRRORS ON THE HD ARE VERY NICE AND EASY TO USE 
I THINK THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR THE KIA VEHICLES OUGHT TO BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT AND IF SO IN MY ESTIMATION WOULD BE LESS COST IF EVERY VEHICLE HAS IT INSTALLED 
I THINK THE NEW DESIGN OF THE HOOD IS A LITTLE WEIRD AND IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE THE NOSE OF THE CAR IS
I THINK THE RAIN SENSING WIPER FEATURE TAKES TOO MUCH WINDSHIELD AREA WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE 
I THINK THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS GREAT I NEVER SOLELY RELY ON IT BUT AS AN ADDITIVE IT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE POSSIBLE OBSTACLES NEAR THE BUMPER OF YOUR VEHICLE THAT YOU COULDN T POSSIBLY SEE JUST BY LOOKING AT YOUR REAR VIEW MIRROR OR REAR WINDOW AL 
I THINK THE REAR WINDOW IS A LITTLE DARK AND SMALL I WISH IT WAS BIGGER AND MORE CLEAR I USED TO DRIVE A 2005 KIA RIO SO THAT S THE TYPE OF REAR WINDOW I M USED TO ALSO AS MENTIONED ON THE PREVIOUS PAGE BECAUSE THE CAR IS HIGHER UP THAN WHAT 
I THINK THE REAR WINDOW IS A LITTLE SMALL BUT THEN AGAIN IT FITS THE STYLE OF THE CAR WELL 
I THINK THE REAR WINDOW WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY WITH A WINDSHIELD WIPER SINCE THEY HAVE IT AT A ALMOST HORIZONTAL ANGLE A MORE VERTICAL WINDOW WOULD GIVE GREATER VISIBILITY 
I THINK THE SIDE MIRROR HEADS COULD BE JUST A BIT LARGER
I THINK THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE RATHER LARGE LEAVING A BLIND SPOT IN THAT SECTION WHEN I M TURNING ESPECIALLY FOR A SHORTER DRIVER 
I THINK THE SOUND COMING FROM THE BLUE TOOTH IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR I HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE REPEAT SO I DON T USE IT THAT OFTEN I SHUT IT OFF BECAUSE OF THE POOR AUDIO 
I THINK THE SOUND IS GREAT AND THE SET UP OF THE STATIONS WAS EASY 
I THINK THE SPEAKER SYSTEM AND/OR AMPLIFIER SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED UPON 
I THINK THE SPEAKERS ARE GREAT 
I THINK THE SPEAKERS COULD BE A LITTLE UPGRADED!
I THINK THE SPEEDOMETER AND TACHOMETER SHOULD BE REVERSED DIFFICULT TO SEE THE LOWER NUMBERS OF THE SPEEDOMETER THEY ARE ALWAYS IN THE SHADOW OF THE DOOR OR WINDOW FRAME 
I THINK THE STEERING WHEEL TURNS TO EASILY AND THUS ROAD FEEL IS TO LOOSE I PREFER THE FIRMER STEERING OF MY 2000 HONDA ACCORD 
I THINK THE SUN VISORS COULD BE A BIT LONGER AND WIDER EVEN ADJUSTABLE 
I THINK THE SUN VISORS COULD BE A BIT LONGER OTHER THAN THAT IT IS PERFECT 
I THINK THE SUNVISORS COULD HAVE BEEN BIGGER AND ADDED AND EXTENSION SO WHEN IT IS FACING THE SIDE WINDOW YOU CAN EXTEND IT OUT LONGER
I THINK THE SYSTEM IS GREAT BUT AGAIN I WISH I COULD HAVE A FACTORY INSTALLED NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON THE EX 6 SPD 
I THINK THE SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR ME I WAS QUICKLY SHOWN BY THE SALESPERSON HOW THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND OTHER SYSTEMS WORK BUT IT WASN T ENOUGH TIME FOR ME TO REALLY UNDERSTAND AND USE IT 
I THINK THE SYSTEM IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE 
I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY MAY NEED TO BE SHARPENED I AM QUITE TECH SAVVY BUT REQUIRE/D SOME TIME TO ADJUST AND ACCLIMATE TO THE TOOLS I WOULD RECOMMEND FIXING THE VOICE CONTROLS MAKING THE SPELLING SYSTEM AND ALL FEATURES MORE EASILY FOUND AND APP 
I THINK THE TOUCHSCREEN COULD USE BOTH A LAYOUT/DESIGN IMPROVEMENT TO MAKE THINGS EASIER TO REACH FAR RIGHT SIDES ARE A LITTLE TOUGH FOR THE DRIVER AS WELL AS THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE HARDWARE ITSELF I DO IMPROVEMENTS OVER YEARS PAST AND VARI 
I THINK THE TRAFFIC INFORMATION COULD BE MORE INFORMATIONAL IDEALLY LOCATION OF LANES BLOCKED ETC 
I THINK THE UPGRADED 9 SPEAKERS ARE GOOD BUT THERE IS SOME ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT HERE I LIKE THE SPEAKERS IN THIS CAR BUT I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A MORE PREMIUM PREMIUM OPTION IT GOES FROM 9 TO 19 IF YOU GET THE HARMON KARDON ONE BUT THAT 
I THINK THE USB MUSIC ABILITY IS ABSOLUTELY FLAWLESS IT GIVES GOOD OPTIONS AND WORKS VERY QUICKLY 
I THINK THE USE OF IPOD IS EASY AND I LIKE THE OPTIONS OF BROWSING 
I THINK THE VEHICLE IS CONSTRUCTED VERY WELL IN THAT YOU CAN SEE ALL AROUND THE CAR VERY EASILY 
I THINK THE VEHICLE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT AND WHAT IS EXPECTED FOR A COUPE AND THE ELECTRONIC SAFETY ITEMS IMPROVE THINGS LIKE CHANGING LANE BUT STILL A BIT HARD FOR VISIBILITY ALSO I DON T DRIVE THE CAR VERY MUCH SO MAYBE I JUST DON T HAVE EN 
I THINK THE VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN MY IS250
I THINK THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT I FEEL VERY SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE 
I THINK THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS NOT AWFUL BUT COULD BE BETTER 
I THINK THE VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING FEELS VERY SAFE SO I THINK IT IS ALL GOOD CAN T SAY ANYTHING ELSE OTHERWISE 
I THINK THE VISOR COULD BE A BIG LARGER SUNGLASSES MAKE THIS IRRELEVANT THOUGH 
I THINK THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS A LOT TO BE DESIRED THOUGH THIS IS A PROBLEM I VE HAD ON MOST VEHICLES SMARTPHONE VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS TO DO SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANY CAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT I VE EVER USED 
I THINK THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF THE FACTORY INSTALLED WIPERS WHEN I CHANGE THE BLADES I BELIEVE THE WIPERSYSTEM WILL BE SUPERIOR 
I THINK THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS COULD BE HIGHER QUALITY FROM THE FACTORY 
I THINK THE WINSHIELD WIOER ON THE DRIVERS SIDE SHOULD CLEAR MORE OF THE WINDOW 
I THINK THERE ARE TOO MANY DISTRACTIONS FROM YOUR DRIVING
I THINK THERE IS A PIECE OF THE AUDIO PANEL MISSING FROM BEHIND THE GLASS ON THE PANEL 
I THINK THERE WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT IF NOT FOR THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR 
I THINK THEY COULD HAVE DEFINITELY INSTALLED A REAR VIEW CAMERA ESPECIALLY ON THE ULTIMATE MODEL 
I THINK THIS CAR S BIGGEST WEAKNESS IS ITS REAR VIEW VISIBILITY THROUGH A RATHER SMALL REAR WINDOW 
I THINK THIS VEHICLE MIGHT ROLL EASILY IF YOU OVER CORRECT DURING FREEWAY HIGH SPEED BECAUSE OF SHORT TURN RADIUS
I THINK TILTING THE DISPLAY TO THE DRIVE A LITTLE WOULD HELP SOMETIMES THE SUN MAKES IT HARD TO SEE THE SCREEN 
I THINK VISIBILITY TO THE EXTERIOR IS REDUCED ON THE SIDES AND THIS DEFECT IS REDUCED WITH THE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM 
I THINK YOU DID AS WELL AS YOU COULD FOR THE SIZE 
I THOROUGHLY ENJOY THE HANDS FREE ASPECTS THE BLUETOOTH SET UP SO I DO NOT HAVE TO PLUG MY PHONE IN TO CALL OR LISTEN TO MUSIC IS A FEATURE IDK IF I WOULD WANT TO DRIVE WITH OUT NOW 
I THOUGHT AUTO HEADLAMPS WERE STANDARD ON ALL VEHICLES I VE HAD IT ON EVERY VEHICLE I VE OWNED SINCE THE LATE 90S UNTIL THE 2015 4RUNNER 
I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING APPLE S CARPLAY BUT INSTEAD GOT A CHEAP IMITATION LAND ROVER S INCONTROL APPS ARE NOT VERY GOOD OR USEFUL VOICE CONTROLS TAKE TOO MANY STEPS AND ARE NOT VERY USEFUL 
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER SOUND 
I THOUGHT THE ENTIRE HEAD S UP DISPLAY WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO LEARN AND USE I COULDN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANUALLY DIAL A RADIO STATION TO CHANGE IT FROM THE ORIGINAL STATION I BELIEVE THE HEADS UP DISPLAY ESPECIALLY THE SOUND SYSTEM PART OF IT 
I THOUGHT THE JEEP LIMITED HAD BLIND SPOT MONITORING MINE DOES NOT WHICH I MISS I THOUGHT THIS WAS STANDARD IN THE LIMITED OR I MAY NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT 
I THOUGHT THE TOUCH SCREEN WAS SO GREAT ONE OF THE REASONS I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE BUT I REALLY DON T USE IT THAT MUCH AND TAKES TOO MUCH FOCUS OFF DRIVING I TEND TO USE THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL 
I TOOK OUT THE REAR HEADRESTS TO SEE BETTER NOBODY EVER SITS BACK THERE 
I TOOK THE REAR SEAT CENTER HEAD REST OUT TO PROVIDE MORE REAR VISIBILITY 
I TOTALED AN AUDI GOING 75MPH ONCE AND CLIMBED OUT OF THE WRECK WITH MINOR INTERNAL BRUISING THEY ARE BUILT LIKE TANKS AND THE SAFEST CARS I HAVE EVER BEEN IN 
I TOTALED MY LAST VELOSTER GOING OFF A LEDGE AT 50MPH AND SLAMMING INTO A TREE I DID NOT HAVE ANY INURY 
I TOTALED THIS SAME TRUCK BEFORE AND WALKED AWAY WITHOUT A SCRATCH 
I TOTALLY LOVE MY CAR THIS IS THE 2ND CHALLENGER I VE OWNED
I TOTALLY LOVE MY KIA SOUL!!!
I TRADED IN A BMW 3 SERIES AND THE REAR WINDOW HAD MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY OTHER THAN THAT I ENJOY THE A3
I TRADED IN MY SORRENTO FOR THE SOUL BECAUSE IT IS EASIER FOR ME TO SEE WHEN I AM DRIVING 
I TRAVEL A LOT OUT OF TOWN AND USE THE SYSTEMS EFFECTIVELY 
I TRAVEL EXTENSIVELY EVERYDAY COULD NOT WORK WITHOUT THE NAVI SYSTEM 
I TRIED SITTING IN OTHER LARGE SUV S AND COULD NOT SEE OVER THE HOOD I LOVE ABSOLUTELY LOVE THAT I CAN SEE OVER AND AROUND THE HOOD OF MY SEQUOIA THANK YOU!
I TRIED TO INCLUDE THIS UNDER THE VISUAL ASPECTS OF THE CAR I HAD ONE PROBLEM ONE DAY WHERE THE TOP SCREEN SUDDENLY WENT DARK I TRIED TO TROUBLESHOOT AND TURNED THE ENGINE OFF RESTARTED THE CAR ETC AND IT STILL WOULD NOT TURN BACK ON SEVERA 
I TRIED TO PROGRAM STATIONS WITH THE DIRECTION SHEET AND IT DOESN T WORK CORRECTLY I HAVE TO MANUALLY CHANGE TO MY PREFERRED STATIONS 
I TRIED TO USED THE VOICE ACTIVATED PHONE CALLS BUT IT WAS HARD TO USE AND DIDN T UNDERSTAND MY VOICE SO NOW I JUST USE THE DIGITAL DISPLAY AND MAKE CALLS ONLY BEFORE DRIVING OR WHEN STOPPED 
I TRULY APPRECIATE THE FEATURES OF THE SYSTEMS LISTED ABOVE THE AUDIO SOUND SYSTEM IS THE BEST I VE HAD I M HEARING BACKGROUND MUSIC IN POPULAR SONGS I NEVER KNEW EXISTED!
I TRULY BELIEVE THAT VW GOLF ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS THE BEST FEATURE OF MY VEHICLE ITS SIMPLY AWESOME LOVE TOUCHSCREEN AND ITS VERY EASY TO USE CONNECTING MY IPHONE OR MY IPOD IS EASY IT ALSO HAS OTHER FEATURES LIKE TPMS CONTROLS FUEL ECONO 
I TRULY CANNOT USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION AT ALL IT CANNOT RECOGNIZE SIMPLE WORDS AND ONCE I CLICK THE VOICE COMMAND BUTTON I CAN T GET OUT OF THE VOICE MENU NEED TO FIX VOICE RECOGNITION
I TRULY DEPEND ON THE REAR CAMERA FOR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING SHOULD BE AND INDUSTRY STANDARD 
I TRULY DON T KNOW HOW TO USE ALL THE FEATURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THEREFORE I FEEL I DO NOT REPRESENT A QUALIFIED PERSON TO ANSWER THIS SURVEY TO TRULY KNOW THIS CAR YOU MUST LIVE IN IT! FOR ME TO REALLY BENEFIT ALL CONTROLS SHOULD BE MADE MUCH 
I TRULY DON T KNOW I LISTEN TO THE RADIO BUT DON T USE A CELL PHONE OR ANY ELECTRONIC GIZMOS WHILE IN THE CAR 
I TRULY ENJOY ALL THREE ASPECTS IF HAVING TO CHOSE ONE OF THE ABOVE I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IMPRESSES ME MOST! ESPECIALLY WITH HD RADIO/SATELLITE RADIO 
I TRULY ENJOY MAKING PHONE CALLS WHILE DRIVING THE EASE OF THE SYSTEM TO GET TO CONNECTED TO ANOTHER PARTY MAKES THE PROCESS EASY IT IS EFFICIENT MAKING A REDIAL A VERY RARE OCCURANCE 
I TRULY ENJOY THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE OUTLANDER IT IS EASY TO USE AND HAS MADE DRIVING MORE PLEASURABLE 
I TRULY FEEL SAFE IN THE RC I DON T REALLY FEEL LIKE THERE ARE ANY BLIND SPOTS IT IS UNBELIEVABLE TO HAVE A SPORTY BUT SAFE VEHICLE THE RC IS BEAUTIFULLY CONSTRUCTED TO INVOLVE NOT ONLY LOOKS BUT SAFETY 
I TRULY FEEL SAFE IN THE SUBARU ESPECIALLY IN THESE WINTER MONTHS!
I TRULY FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE!
I TRULY FEEL SAFER DRIVING MY CHARGER WITH ALL THE WARNING SIGNALS
I TRULY HATE THE CD PLAYER IN THIS NEW CAR!
I TRULY LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS ARE AMAZING AND SO CLEAR SOUNDING THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS CAR SHE ROCKS 
I TRULY LOVE THE INTERACTION WITH ONSTAR AND THE NAV IN THE VEHICLE MY FAVORITE PART IS THE DING/BUZZ AS YOU ARE ALMOST TO THE PLACE EXIT OR POI YOU ARE TO BE TURNING OR ARRIVING 
I TRULY LOVE THIS CAR!
I TRULY LOVE THIS VENZA 
I TRULY LOVE THOSE EXTRA WINDOW SUN SCREENS/COVERS THAT COME WITH THE VEHICLE AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT FOR BOTH REAR DOORS AND THE REAR WINDOW EXCELLENT ADDED FEATURE THAT I AS A DRIVER DIDN T REALIZE HOW MUCH I WOULD APPRECIATE THEM UNTIL USED F 
I TRUSTED THE BACKUP SAFETY SYSTEM TO WARN ME OF OBJECTS BEHIND ME AND I BACKED INTO A TRUNK!!! NEVER TRUST THE BACKUP SAFETY SYSTEM ALONE!
I TURN TO LOOK OUT OF WINDOWS WHEN CHANGING LANES TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS WITH WINDOW LOCATIONS I DO NOT LIKE TO RELY ON MIRRORS ONLY WHEN CHANGING LANES 
I TWICE INADVERTENTLY CALLED FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE WHILE ADJUSTING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I M CAREFUL TO AVOID THE BUTTONS NOW 
I TYPICALLY DROVE SUVS SO I M STILL ADJUSTING TO MY NEW CAR 
I TYPICALLY HAVE ISSUES SEEING EXACTLY WHERE THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE IS ALTHOUGH HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH PREVIOUS VEHICLE PROBABLY MORE RELATED TO MY HEIGHT VS VEHICLE DESIGN 
I UNDERSTAND THE REAR WIPER BLADE CANNOT EXCEED THE DIMENSIONS OF THE WINDOW ITSELF BUT IT SEEMS TO SWEEP A SMALL AREA 
I UNDESTAND THAT IT S AN ECONOMY CAR BUT ENGINE AND ROAD NOISE IS LOUD
I UPGRADED THE SOUND SYSTEM WHICH IS REALLY NICE
I USE A FLASH DRIVE IN THE USB PORT FOR ALL MY MUSIC THAT I HAVE DOWN LOADED ONTO IT IT IS VERY CUMBERSOME TO USE EVERY TIME A CD HAS FINISHED PLAYING I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF BROWSING AND THEN MUSIC TO GET TO THE ALBUMS 
I USE A GAMIN NUVI INSTEAD OF THE VEHICLE S NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I USE A LARGER REAR MIRROR VERSUS THE ONE GIVEN SO I CAN SEE BETTER FOR REAR VISIBILITY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE REAR VISIBILITY WHEN THE BACK HEAD RESTS ARE UP IT TAKES UP REAR VISIBILITY 
I USE A LOT OF DIFFERENT NAVIGATION SYSTEMS THE PORSCHE VERSION IS THE EASIEST TO UNDERSTAND AND IS THE MOST INTUITIVE IN HELPING WITH DRIVING AND TRAFFIC SITUATIONS 
I USE A WINDOWS PHONE AND THERE ARE NO APPLICATIONS SUPPORTED BETWEEN SYNC AND WP8 ONLY IPHONE AND ANDROID SUPPORT FOR THIS PLATFORM WOULD BE THE BIGGEST IMPROVEMENT 
I USE AN ANDROID SMART PHONE WHICH IS NOT COMPATIBLE WHEN CONNECTING VIA USB THIS IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL TO ME 
I USE AN IPHONE CONNECTED BY USB FOR CHARGE GPS MUSIC/LINE LEVEL VOLUME OF PLAYER ALSO CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH FOR CALLS � THE STEREO SYSTEM USES ITS OWN MIC AND SPEAKERS FOR SPEAKING TEXTS ET CETERA TO MY PHONE SOMETIME USING VOICE SEARC
I USE AN IPHONE SO I AM NOT ABLE TO USE THE SYNC TEXT SERVICES I WANT SYNC TO BE FULLY COMPATIBLE AND INTERACTIVE WITH AN IPHONE SIRI I HAVE USED THE CURRENT UCONNECT SYSTEM FROM JEEP I LIKE THAT UCONNECT HAS A DEDICATED TRAFFIC/WEATHER CHANN 
I USE ANDROID PHONE AND TABLET THE APPLE SYSTEM IN GLOVE BOX NOT USED NO GARAGE EITHER 
I USE APPLE PRODUCTS AND IN MY OPINION ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT I M USED TO WITH APPLE S IOS IS CUMBERSOME AND ANNOYING TO USE THUS MY LOW ISH ASSESSMENT OF THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION NAV ENTERTAINMENT RANKINGS I D PREFER MY RANGE ROVER TO 
I USE BLUETOOTH TO LISTEN TO IPOD LIKE THIS CAPABILITY A LOT 
I USE DEEZER ELITE LOSSLESS STREAMING THE FACT THAT IN ORDER TO ACCESS DEEZER IN THE VEHICLE I HAVE TO START THE BMW CONNECT APP ON THE PHONE PLUG THE PHONE IN VIA USB THEN GO THROUGH MULTIPLE MENU LAYERS TO START DEEZER IS CRAZY AND ANNOYI 
I USE GOOGLE MAPS OR WAZE I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE ONE OF THESE SERVICES ADDED ON TO YOU VEHICLES AS THEY ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I USE HOTSPOT MIRRORS ON MY ELEMENT AND I WILL DO THE SAME WITH THIS CAR SOON THE ADDED BEND TO THE REARVIEW MIRRORS DOESN T SHOW ME ENOUGH ALSO MY 04 ELEMENT HAS EXTENDABLE SUN VISORS THAT CAN COVER THE ENTIRE WINDOW WHY DOES MY 2015 FIT RE 
I USE IT MINIMALLY I USE IT MINIMALLY SO IT S NOT OF ANY REAL IMPORTANCE TO ME
I USE IT VERY INFREQUENTLY 
I USE MY IPHONE AS A SOURCE FOR MOST NAV AND AUDIO I WOULD PREFER IF THE CAR CAME EQUIPPED WITH CARPLAY
I USE MY PHONE DAILY AND I REALLY LIKE THE EASE OF USE OF THE HANDS OFF COMMUNICATION EVERY ONE I TALK WITH REPORTS THE VOICE IS CLEAR AND THE VOICE IS NOT DISTORTED I REALLY LIKED THAT I CAN TEXT ORALLY WITH THIS SYSTEM
I USE MY PHONE FREQUENTLY AND IT MAKES CALLS WHILE DRIVING A PLEASURE TO USE 
I USE MY PHONE I SELDOM LISTEN TO MUSIC OR THE RADIO IF I HAVE ANYTHING ELSE I AM NOT AWARE OF IT ALTHOUGH I PURCHASED SEVERAL OPTIONS ON PURPOSE ON THIS CAR ITS FUNCTION IS TO COMFORTABLY GET ME FROM POINT A TO POINT B I GET WHERE I AM 
I USE NAVIGATION ON MY PHONE BUT THE ONLY TIME IT CONNECTS THROUGH THE VEHICLE IS WHEN I USE PANDORA 
I USE ON STAR DAILY WITH THE RADIO AND THE BLUETOOTH AND I M COMPLETELY SATISFIED
I USE ON STAR FOR DRIVING INSTRUCTIONS I LIVE IN A RURAL COMMUNITY AND IT IS SAFER FOR ME TO USE TURN BY TURN INSTRUCTION WHEN I GET TO HEAVIER TRAFFIC
I USE ONE ITEM AUDIO
I USE ONSTAR FOR DIRECTIONS THE AUDIO AND DISPLAY ARE VERY GOOD NO COMPLAINTS 
I USE PANDORA FROM MY PHONE 95% OF THE TIME IT CONNECTS PRETTY RELIABLE AND SOUNDS GOOD I ALSO HAVE A THUMB DRIVE ATTACHED TO A USB PORT THIS HAS WORKED PERFECT SINCE DAY ONE DON T CARE FOR XM AND NEVER LISTEN TO FM 
I USE SERIUS! THAT S IT!!!!
I USE SPOTIFY THROUGH MY PHONE TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND SOMETIMES VEHICLES AUDIO SCREEN FREEZES UP MUSIC WILL PLAY PUT SONG TITLES WILL NOT ADVANCE ON DISPLAY SCREEN
I USE SYNCH TO CONTROL MY AMAZON FIRE TABLET THIS WORKS VERY WELL I ALSO USE IT TO COMMUNICATE WITH MY CELL PHONE WHICH WORKS GREAT!
I USE THE BLIND SPACE MIRROR A LOT ON THE HIGHWAY MORE CAMERAS MIGHT BE A GOOD THING WHILE THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE WITH THE REAR CAMERA ITS ABSOLUTELY FINE 
I USE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION FOR MY PHONE TO PLAY MUSIC ALL THE TIME I LOVE THE HANDS FREE IT IS GREATLY IMPROVED FROM THE 2009 MURANO SINCE I DON T HAVE TO YELL OR SPEAK DIFFERENTLY TO TALK ON THE PHONE I WISH THE APPLICATIONS WORKED WITH 
I USE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WITH MY PHONE DAILY IT WORKS GREAT PUSH ONE BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL TELL IT TO CALL AND IT S DONE 
I USE THE BLUETOOTH PHONE ALL THE TIME I ALSO LOVE SATELLITE RADIO AND MY DAUGHTER CAN PLUG IN HER IPHONE WITH THE USB ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I BOUGHT THIS CAR WAS FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND BACKUP CAMERA 
I USE THE BLUTOOTH HANDSFREE A LOT COMMON COMPLAINT FROM PERSON ON THE OTHER END IS THAT THEY CAN T HEAR ME VERY WELL LOUSY CONNECTION I HAVE NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM IN OTHER BUICKS I HAVE OWNED 
I USE THE CAR FOR SHORT COMMUTES AND JOY RIDES JUST DON T NEED MOST FEATURES FOR THAT 
I USE THE CONNECTED IPHONE TO CONDUCT 90% OF MY BUSINESS I SORT OF WISH THERE WAS AN OPTION TO DELETE THESE FACTORY SYSTEMS AND JUST USE THE PHONE FOR NAVIGATION ALTERNATE AUDIO SOURCES PHONE ETC LET THE CAR PROVIDE BIG SCREEN MICROPHONE A 
I USE THE FLASHING LIGHTS ON MY SIDE MIRRORS ALL THE TIME! LOVE THEM!!!
I USE THE FM RADIO AND BLUTOOTH FOR MY PHONE TO RECEIVE CALLS DON T REALLY TAKE THE TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT 
I USE THE HANDS FREE PHONE A LOT THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR FINDING RADIO STATIONS IS NOT USEFUL TO ME AS IT TAKES MY EYES OFF THE ROAD MORE SO THAN THE OLD TYPE WHERE YOU COULD PRESS SCAN AND FIND A STATION YOU LIKE WITHOUT GOING THROUGH SEVERAL ME 
I USE THE LITTLE ROUND ADD ON MIRRORS ON THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS SO I DONT EVEN HAVE TO LOOK AROUND TO DRIVE SAFELY
I USE THE NAV FUNCTION DAILY EASY TO USE SOUND IS EXCELLENT 
I USE THE NAV SYSTEM EVERY TIME I AM IN THE CAR I LIKE TO CHECK AND SEE WHERE I AM AT AT ALL TIMES
I USE THE NAVAGATION SYSTEM FOR POINTS OF INTEREST MOST OFTEN IT IS CUMBERSOME TO GO THROUGH A DOZEN STEPS INSTEAD OF SAYING FIND ANY RESTAURANT NEARBY I ALSO HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH ADDRESSES WHICH ARE ON A HIGHWAY I DON T ALWAYS KNOW IF T 
I USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ONLY RARELY BU THE LAYOUT IS CONFUSING AND THE DIRECTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN INACCURATE IT HAS FREQUENTLY TOLD ME TO BEAR RIGHT WHEN THERE IS NO CURVE OR BEND IN THE ROAD AND THESE ARE MAJOR ROADS IN A MAJOR US CI 
I USE THE PARKING ASSIST BLIND ASSIST AND REAR CAMERA FOR VISIBILITY I WOULD NOT NECESSARILY RATE THE ABILITY TO SEE AS HIGH WITHOUT THESE 
I USE THE PHONE AND RADIO ONLY 
I USE THE PHONE CONNECTED USUALLY FOR SAFETY AND HAND FREE COMMUNICATION WHEN DRIVING AND ALSO THE CONVENIENCE WHEN NEEDED USUALLY LIKE MUSIC WHEN DRIVING ANY DISTANCE NAVIGATION IS ONE ITEM I AM GETTING USED TO AND GLAD TO HAVE AVAILABLE 
I USE THE PHONE FEATURE THE MOST I WISH IT HAD A TOUCH PAD THE OTHER DAY I WAS CALLING TO REPORT A GAS LEAK AND COULDN T PRESS ONE OR ANYTHING TO COMPLETE THE CALL HAD TO YOU MY IPHONE WHICH IS AGAINST THE LAW IN DC 
I USE THE PHONE OPTION ALL THE TIME AND LOVE IT!!
I USE THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC INFORMATION ALMOST EVERY TIME I DRIVE THE BMW OUTSTANDING FEATURE 
I USE THE USB INPUT ALL THE TIME IT IS VERY EASY TO USE 
I USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND BLUETOOTH TO CALL MY WIFE EVERY DAY ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK 
I USE TO EAR MUSIC THROUGH BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WITH IPHONE CONNECTION IS AUTOMATIC SINCE THE CELL PHONE IS PAIRED AND SOUND IS GREAT 
I USE WAZE ON MY SMARTPHONE FOR NAVIGATION BECAUSE IT IS MORE ACCURATE UP TO THE MINUTE TRAFFIC POLICE AND STOP LIGHT CAMERAS SINCE IT IS CROWD SOURCED 
I USED TO ALWAYS OWN A TOYOTA NEVER HAD AUDIO PROBLEM IT SYNCED WITH MY PHONE AND REMEMBERED EACH TIME I GOT INTO MY CAR NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THIS AUDIO SYSTEM AT ALL
I USED TO DRIVE A 2007 MAZDA 3 AND I FELT I HAD LESS BLIND SPOTS IN THAT MODEL BUT I WILL SAY THE BLIND SPOT SENSORS AND BACK UP CAMERA ARE A HUGE HELPS WITH THIS THE SUN VISORS IN THIS CAR ARE TOO SMALL AND BARELY BLOCK ANY SUNLIGHT FOR ME 
I USED TO GET LOST IN A PAPER BAG NOW MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM ALWAYS GETS ME TO WHEREVER I AM GOING 
I USED TO HAVE A 2010 ACADIA AND I NEVER FELT LIKE IT HAS AS BAD OF A REAR/SIDE BLIND SPOT AS THE DURANGO HAS IT HAS TAKEN SOME GETTING USED TO 
I USED TO HAVE AN ACURA THEIR SYSTEM WAS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY THE VOLVO SYSTEM HAS SO MANY BUTTONS AND CONTROLS THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT APPEARS TO BE 10 15 YEARS OLD THERE IS NO TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM THE ONLY DOWNSIDE OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH 
I USUALLY DRIVE WITH THE TOP DOWN SO VISIBILITY IS NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL 
I USUALLY LISTEN TO MUSIC STORED ON A USB DRIVE THE SYSTEM OFTEN FORGETS WHAT SONG I WAS LISTENING TO WHEN RESTARTING THE CAR AND STARTS OVER AT THE FIRST SONG THIS IS MORE ANNOYING THAN YOU WOULD THINK 
I VE ADDED STICK ON WIDE ANGLE MIRROR ATTACHMENTS TO MY SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THE LEFT & RIGHT REAR CORNERS ARE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE OBJECTS CARS IN THOSE BLIND SPOTS 
I VE ALREADY CALLED RAM ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND THEY ARE WELL AWARE OF IT FROM OTHER OWNERS FOR SOME REASON THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN OFF THE RADIO IN THE 2015 RAMS YOU CAN MUTE IT BUT YOU CAN T TURN IT OFF A LOT OF TIME I JUST WANT TO PUT DOW 
I VE ALREADY HAD A FEW CLOSE CALLS WITH OTHER NEGLIGENT DRIVERS AND HAD TO USE MY BRAKES HARD AND HORN I VE FELT VERY SAVE BOTH TIMES AND WAS ABLE TO AVOID BOTH ACCIDENTS 
I VE ALREADY REPLACED THE PIONEER FACTORY SYSTEM WITH A NEW SOUND SYSTEM ALSO PIONEER I ADDED A SUB WOOFER AND TWO AMPLIFIERS AS WELL 
I VE ALWAYS HAD AFTERMARKET AUDIO IN EVERY OTHER CAR I VE OWNED SO I M PROBABLY JUST TOO USED TO THAT BUT I FEEL THAT CLEARER TREBLE AND DEEPER BASS WOULD BE NICE
I VE BEEN CAUGHT WITH BLIND SPOT SITUATIONS THAT I DIDN T EXPECT A FEW TIMES GETTING USED TO BEING MORE CAUTIOUS AS A RESULTS DISAPPOINTED IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REAR WIPER BLADE SEEMS TO SMUDGE RATHER THAN CLEAN 
I VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE IF I EVER HAVE A COLLISION 
I VE BEEN MISROUTED ONCE OR TWICE 
I VE BEEN TOLD BLUETOOTH QUALITY FOR PERSON I M CALLING IS POOR THEY HEAR AN ECHO ALTHOUGH I HEAR THEM FINE??
I VE BEEN TOLD THE SOUND QUALITY OF PHONE MIC IS POOR 
I VE DRIVEN THIS CAR ABOUT TEN TIMES AND LOVE THE FEEL SPEED EXCELERATION LACK OF OUTSIDE SOUND AND ALL EXTRAS THIS IS A GREAT CAR 
I VE FOUND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CONFUSING AND WILL NEED TO GO BACK FOR HELP AND DIRECTIONS AS I CANNOT GET IT TO WORK I AM ACTUALLY PRETTY TECH SAVVY BUT AM MISSING ON SOMETHING HERE 
I VE HAD 3 JAGUARS AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN HORRIBLE SO I GAVE UP TRYING TO USE IT 
I VE HAD A NUMBER OF NEAR MISS LANE CHANGING COLLISIONS ALREADY THE BLIND SPOT IS PRETTY BIG FOR A VEHICLE THAT LOW TO THE GROUND I DO A LOT OF NECK STRETCHING TO ENSURE MY SIDE IS CLEAR I M GLAD I HAVE A LOT OF TORQUE AT HIGH SPEED BECAUSE EV 
I VE HAD FEW COMPLAINTS OF VEHICLE ROAD NOISE COMING THROUGH THE CALL WHEN USING THE INTEGRATED HANDS FREE AND POSSIBLY BETTER GRAPHICS/MORE SOURCES AND OR APP INTEGRATION POSSIBILITIES 
I VE HAD ISSUES FORM DAY ONE REGARDING THE HANDS FREE PHONE AND USB CONNECTION
I VE HAD SO MANY OF THESE CARS BECAUSE OF THE FEELING OF SAFETY THEY IMPART
I VE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION AFTER PRESSING THE HANDS FREE AUDIO BUTTON TO CONNECT TO MY PHONE I ALSO DON T LIKE THE DISPLAY ON THE DASH AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO PRESS THE OPTION YOU WANT WHILE DRIVING IT WOULD BE BETTER IF 
I VE HAD TO HAVE IT REPLACED AND IT IS SLOW AND DOESN T INTERACT WELL WITH MY IPOD
I VE HAD TO PAIR MY IPHONE WITH THE BLUETOOTH SEVERAL TIMES 
I VE HAD TO RESET MY RADIO ONCE BECAUSE THE PHONE OPTION SOMEHOW DISCONNECTED MY BLUETOOTH 
I VE HEARD THAT THE CAR PHONE SOUNDS FANTASTIC FROM THE OPPOSITE END OF THE LINE 
I VE HEARD THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT SOUND GOOD FROM THE RECEIVING END 
I VE LEARNED HOW TO USE THE CAR S SYSTEMS WITHOUT SPENDING MUCH TIME READING THE SYSTEMS ARE LARGELY INTUITIVE AND HAVE WORKED FLAWLESSLY I FLIP CONSTANTLY BETWEEN SIRUS FM RADIO BLUETOOTH IPHONE AND USB IPOD THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXACT 
I VE NEVER BEEN IN A VEHICLE WITH BETTER VISIBILITY FROM THE INSIDE THE WINDOWS ARE VERY INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED TO ALLOW MAXIMUM VISION OF THE SURROUNDINGS AND THE KIDS LOVE THAT THEY CAN SEE OUT ALSO FARLEY FARLEY FARLEY FARLEY FARLEY HA F 
I VE NEVER DRIVEN THIS CAR AT NIGHT SO I REALLY DON T KNOW HOW WELL THE HEADLIGHTS WORK 
I VE NEVER FELT AS SAFE AS I DO WHILE DRIVING AS I DO WHEN DRIVING MY GLA 250 I HAVE COMMAND OF THE RODE AND I WANT TO DRIVE AND DRIVE
I VE NEVER GOTTEN USED TO VOICE RECOGNITION ON ANY TECHNOLOGY DEVISE SO I DON T REALLY USE IT HOWEVER THE PHONE/AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE AMAZING! I REALLY LOVE THE SOFT TOUCH OF ALL THE BUTTON CONTROLS THROUGHOUT THE CAR EASY T 
I VE NEVER HAD A BETTER SOUNDING STOCK AUDIO SYSTEM IN A CAR THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WORKS THE LAYOUT WORKS BUT HAS A LEARNING CURVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DISAPPOINTING THE SCREEN RESOLUTION IS VERY POOR THE VOICE AND PICTURE DIRECTION 
I VE NEVER HAD A NAVIGATION SYSTEM BEFORE I LIKE THE LOOK OF IT BIG SCREEN WHEN THERE ARE TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS ROAD BLOCKS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LETS ME AVOID DISREGARD PROBLEMS AHEAD IT ALSO RE ROUTES ME TO AVOID DELAYS THIS IS VERY HELPFUL 
I VE NEVER HAD A NAVIGATION SYSTEM BEFORE SO I LOVE IT!
I VE NEVER HAD ANY OF THESE FEATURES IN A CAR BEFORE SO I M VERY HAPPY WITH THEM 
I VE NEVER HAD MUCH LUCK WITH THE VOICE COMMANDS THE MAP ENGINE BEHIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CAN BE IMMENSELY FRUSTRATING AT TIMES LET S SAY I WANT TO GO TO 836 WILSON AVE IN NAPERVILLE SHOULD BE EASY BUT THEN I M GIVEN 5 6 CHOICES ALONG W 
I VE NEVER HIT CURBS BEFORE THIS CAR AND IT S HAPPENED THREE TIMES ALREADY ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE SOMETHING ABOUT HOW LOW IT IS CAUSES LOW VISIBILITY IN THAT CORNER 
I VE NEVER USED BLUETOOTH EVER THE FORESTER MAKES IT SOOO EASY I LOVE MY FORESTER!
I VE NEVER USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BEFORE 
I VE NOT DOWNLOADED MY OWN MUSIC YET AS I AM ENJOYING THE SIX MONTHS OF FREE SIRIUS I VE NOT USED THE CONNECTION TO MY PHONE AND DO NOT KNOW IF IT READS TEXTS OR NOT IN THE PAST I VE HAD TROUBLE WITH MY MERCURY MARINER BLUE TOOTH CONNECTING T 
I VE NOT HAD EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER SYSTEMS IT WORKS WELL BUT I DON T USE IT MUCH 
I VE NOTICED LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS I CAN T SEE PAST THE SIDE MIRRORS SO IF THERE IS A CURB WHEN TURNING I MIGHT HIT IT BECAUSE I DIDN T SEE IT IN A PARKING LOT ONCE I DIDN T SEE A CAR COMING BECAUSE THE SIDE MIRROR BLOCKED MY VIEW MAYBE I AM SIT 
I VE NOTICED THAT IT S HARDER FOR ME TO SEE THE VEHICLES BESIDE ME AND BEHIND ME IN THIS VEHICLE THAN IN MY OLDER ALTIMA ALSO THE SUN VISORS ARE SUB PAR FOR A NICER VEHICLE AND ALL THE GREAT FEATURES IT HAS I WOULD VE EXPECTED LARGER VISORS M 
I VE NOTICED THAT WHEN THE RADAR IS ACTIVE ON CRUISE CONTROL THAT IT WILL SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN TO A CERTAIN POINT AND THEN KICK OFF WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE VEHICLE CAPABLE OF COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP IN A SITUATION ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE R 
I VE ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR A MONTH AND I M STILL LEARNING ABOUT ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES I M 76 YEARS OLD AND SOME OF THIS IS VERY NEW TO ME IT S VERY COLD IN WISCONSIN AND I DON T SPEND ANY TIME SITTING IN THE CAR AND TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO 
I VE ONLY HAD THIS VEHICLE 3 MONTHS AND NEED TO USE IT MORE TO COMMENT
I VE ONLY OWNED LEXUS SUVS AND BOUGHT MY DURST ONE IN 2005 I HAD AN ACCIDENT THAT TOTALED MY 2014 GX IN JAN 2015 I VE NEVER FELT AS SAFE IN A CAR ACCIDENT AS I DID IN THIS VEHICLE TWO DRIVER AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AND I ONLY HAD WHIPLASH IN SPITE OF T 
I VE ONLY PUT 3500 MILES ON IT SO FAR SO IM NOT COMPLETELY COMFORTABLE WITH IT JUST YET
I VE ONLY USED THE RADIO AM/FM SYSTEM AS I DO NOT USE ANY OTHER FEATURES WHILE I AM DRIVING 
I VE OWNED THE CAR LESS THAN THREE MONTHS AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE ALREADY STREAKY 
I VE REPLACED ALL THE SPEAKERS ADDED A SUBWOOFER IN THE TRUNK ADDED AN AMPLIFIER I KEPT THE ORIGINAL HEAD UNIT SO I COULD MAINTAIN ALL OF THE STOCK STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS MAIN COMPLAINT IS THE STOCK SPEAKERS DO NOT OFFER VERY GOOD CLARITY SO 
I VE SAID IT ALL ABOVE 
I VE SAID MAKE IT EASIER TO SET UP AND IUSE
I VE SEEN BETTER DISPLAYS I E GARMIN THE SMALL SCREEN MAKES IT HARD TO READ SOME STREET NAMES ALSO WHEN USING THE MENU OFTEN THE SCREEN ACCEPTS THE TOUCH AS A MAP REPOSITION THE SIDE BUTTONS CAN BE OVER SENSITIVE PERHAPS AN ADJUSTMENT?
I VE SEEN MUCH BETTER CAMERA VIEWS WHILE BACKING IT IS HARD TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE AS TO HOW CLOSE THE SIDES ARE AND THEIR IS NO INDICATOR AS TO YOUR AS YOU TURN 
I VE STATED IN PREVIOUS SURVEY PAGE AS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL 
I VE USED OTHER NAVIGATION SYSTEMS WHERE THE DISPLAYS ARE WITH BETTER CLARITY THE VISUALS WERE DESIGNED WITH MORE DETAIL THE KNOB TO TURN BETWEEN FUNCTIONS I FIND MORE DIFFICULT TO USE THAN A TOUCH SCREEN OPERATION 
I VE USED VEHICLE STEREOS FROM BOSE AUDIO TO BEATS AND WHATEVER STOCK AUDIO SYSTEM IN MY 200 SOUNDS GREAT! ALL OF THE INSTRUMENTS ARE VERY USER FRIENDLY 
I VERY MUCH LIKE THE DRIVERS SIDE INSET MIRROR IT FEELS AS THOUGH I HAVE NO BLIND SPOTS 
I VERY MUCH LIKE THE EASE OF STATION SELECTION USING THE ROTATING WHEEL I LIKE THE EASE OF SETTING PRE SELECTED STATIONS AND CHANGING BETWEEN STATIONS WHILE DRIVING I TYPICALLY SWITCH STATIONS WHEN THE ADVERTISEMENTS COME ON OR WHEN A PROGRAM 
I VERY MUCH LIKE THE HANDS FREE TELEPHONE USE THE SPEAKER IS VERY GOOD QUALITY I HAD THIS OPTION OF ANOTHER VEHICLE AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE CALLER 
I VERY MUCH MISS THE PARK ASSIST BEEPERS FROM THE LEXUS WHEN I AM PULLING INTO THE GARAGE OR PARALLEL PARKING 
I VERY RARELY MAKE USE OF AUDIO DEVICES AND THEREFORE AM NOT IN A POSITION TO OFFER ANY HELPFUL EVALUATION 
I VISIBILITY IN MY KIA IS VERY GOOD I CAN SEE EVERYTHING AROUND ME FRONT AND REAR AND WHILE CHANGING LANES 
I VOICE COMMAND DOESN T WORK VERY WELL CANNOT TALK TO PEOPLE THRU THE BLUE TOOTH AS THEY TELL ME IT S HARD TO HEAR ME NEED TO HAVE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS FOR SAFER OPERATION OF SYSTEM 
I WANT A WAY TO HAVE A BEEPER FOR REAR PARK ASSIST THAT IS LOUDER AND MORE RESPONSIVE THIS IS A POOR SYSTEM WITH A GOOD CAMERA 
I WANT EVERYTHING TO BE ACCESSIBLE WHILE DRIVING IF THERE IS A FRONT PASSENGER 
I WANT IT TO UNDERSTAND MY COMMANDS 
I WANT MANUFACTORER TO PUT THE LITTLE CIRCULAR MIRROR INSIDE THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS TO ELIMINATE THE BLIND SPOT 
I WANT MORE CONTROL OVER AUDIO SOUND 
I WANT TEXT MESSAGES SPOKEN TO ME OR PRINTED OUT ON MONITOR 
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET ENSURE SO I CAN GET TRAFFIC INFORMATION I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT INSTALLED THERE IS NOTHING THAT HAS CLEARLY GIVEN ME THE INFORMATION I NEED TO USE THIS DIMENSION OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SELECT STATIONS ON XM BY TYPING NUMBERS DIRECTLY 
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE MORE OF THE MOBILE APPS I WANT IT TO BE EASIER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONNECT TO MOBILE APPS VS JUST PLAYING INTERNET RADIO OVER THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION 
I WANT TO REMOVE THE REAR HEADRESTS AND I HOPE THEY ARE EASY TO GET IN AND OUT I WILL USE THEM WHEN I HAVE SOMEONE SITTING BACK THERE WHICH IS NOT USUAL BUT I WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE THEM EASILY WHEN NEEDED 
I WANTED LASER CRUISE CONTROL THAT WAS NOT AVAILABLE
I WANTED TO TRY THE CRV BUT DISLIKED THE BLACK BORDER AROUND REAR WINDOW I WANT A LARGE CLEAR PIECE OF GLASS AT THE REAR ALONG WITH THE NEW SAFETY FEATURES 
I WAS A PREVIOUS OWNER OF A 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA WHEN I HAD A HEAD ON COLLISION IN JANUARY 2015 MY 2014 NISSAN ALTIMA WAS DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS AND THE SAFETY OF THAT VEHICLE WAS JUST IMPECCABLE I WAS VERY THANKFUL FOR WALKING AWAY FROM THE COLLI 
I WAS ABLE TO RAISE THE DRIVER SEAT HIGH ENOUGH TO SEE PROPERLY 
I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY SURPRISED AT THE VISIBILITY IN GENERAL BUT I FIND THE VIEWING FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR A BIT OBSTRUCTED THANK GOODNESS FOR REAR VIEW CAMERAS
I WAS AFRAID I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OUT THE REAR BUT I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT HOW WELL I COULD SEE 
I WAS ALITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN PROJECTOR HEADLIGHTS I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE BRIGHTER MAYBE LED S?
I WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY DEFECTIVE WITHIN JUST A FEW WEEKS OF OWNERSHIP AND THE DEALERSHIP HAS PROVEN INCOMPETENT IN IT S REPAIR ATTEMPT
I WAS ALREADY USED TO BMW S NAVIGATION SYSTEM THIS ONE IS SIMILAR TO 2006 BMW 
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT REAR VISIBILITY AND BLIND SPOTS IN THE VEHICLE WHEN I FIRST TEST DROVE IT BUT RANGE ROVER HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB IN ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLES SENSORS AND CAMERAS I HAVE NOT HAD ANY ISSUES OR CONCERNS WITH 
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FRONT IMPACT CRASH RATINGS FOR THE DRIVER ONE OF THE FRONT COLLISION RATINGS WAS NOT VERY HIGH IT MADE ME HESITANT TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DIDN T COME W/ A CD PLAYER HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE SOME OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM YET 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT NOT ONLY DIDN T HAVE A CD PLAYER NEVER DISCLOSED UNTIL DELIVERY BUT THAT I HAD LOST THE FUNCTION TO STORE MUSIC RECORD CD S 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE 2015 DID NOT INCLUDE THE NEW SYNC 3 SYSTEM HOPEFULLY WHEN SYNC 3 IS RELEASED THE 2015 MUSTANG WILL RECEIVE THE NEW SOFTWARE HOPEFULLY THE HARDWARE IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW SYSTEM 
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE CAR WAS NOT UPDATED WITH THE IPHONE 5 EXTERNAL MEDIA DEVICE AND I DID NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF PLAYING MY IPHONE MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH SINCE I DO NOT HAVE NAVIGATION COMPARED TO OTHER PREVIOUS CARS WHICH ALLOWED ME TO DO 
I WAS EXCITED TO USE THE ONBOARD APPS THE ONLY APPS THAT I CAN USE ARE TWO MUSIC APPS AND FACEBOOK I WANT WEATHER MAPS REAL APPS FOR NAVIGATION A BIG LET DOWN I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO UPGRADE SYSTEMS ON THE TOP OF THE LINE S MODEL WITHOUT 
I WAS EXPECTING A LARGE BLIND SPOT DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE SIDE WINDOWS AND SIZE OF THE C PILLAR THE REAR AND SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ALLOW FOR A PERFECT ADJUSTMENT TO MINIMIZE THE BLIND SPOT 
I WAS EXPECTING A LOT BETTER SYSTEM AND CONTROLS FOR ALL THIS FROM MB IT DOES NOT LOOK OR FEEL ANYTHING BETTER THAN ORDINARY 
I WAS EXPECTING A SLIGHTLY MORE DYNAMIC AUDIO SYSTEM I E 9 12 MIXTURE OF SPEAKERS AND A SUBWOOFER AS FOUND IN MY 2004 VOLVO S80/T6 I ALSO THINK THE THAT AT LEAST 2 3 SPEAKERS SHOULD BE PLACED IN EMPTY SPACE ABOVE/BEHIND RED SEATS AGAIN AS I 
I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THIS SYSTEM FROM MY OTHER DODGE CARAVAN THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED ANOTHER ONE EVEN THOUGH THIS CAR IS MISSING SOME OF THE FEATURES OF MY OLDER VAN I STILL AM VERY HAPPY WITH IT!
I WAS GIVEN TWO CHOICES TO A CERTAIN LOCATION EVEN IF I CHOSE MY OWN IN ABOUT ONE HOUR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DECIDES TO REDIRECT ME TO THEIR ORGINAL CHOICE BUT I WAS ONLY A FEW BLOCKS AWAY FROM MY DESTINATION ALREADY! 
I WAS GOING TO BUY A PRIUS BUT THE VISIBILITY WHEN IT RAINED WAS AWFUL SO I WENT WITH THE VENZA AND THE VISIBILITY IS AWESOME FOR ME !!!!!!!!
I WAS HAPPY WITH THE DISPLAY AND EASE OF USE OF IPOD AND OVERLAE EASE OF ENTIRE SYSTEM GOOD JOB WITH THAT THE SPEAKERS ARE JUST OK 
I WAS HIT IN THE DRIVERS SIDE REAR WHEEL ACCIDENT IN MY YUKON XL AND SURVIVED A ROLLOVER WITH MINOR INJURIES IN JANUARY OF 2015 THE CANYON GIVES ME SOME OF THE SAME FEEL AND THE SAFE FEELING AS THE YUKON 
I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE AMOUNT OF FM STATIONS IT WAS ABLE TO PICK UP A GOOD ARRAY OF OPTIONS WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC ON A LONG DAILY DRIVE 
I WAS IN A WRECK WHERE A DUMP TRUCK REAR ENDED ME IN MY JETTA 2013 AND I FELT VERY SAFE AFTER SURVIVING THAT WRECK THE DAMAGE STOPPED AT MY BACK SEAT SO I FELT THAT THE JETTA IS A VERY SAFE CAR TO GO UP AGAINST A DUMP TRUCK AND PROTECT ME FROM 
I WAS INFORMED AT PURCHASE THAT MY VEHICLE CONTAINED NAVIGATION ONLY REALIZING AFTER PURCHASE THAT IT DID NOT 
I WAS INVOLVED IN A HEAD ON COLLISION WITH MY FIRST 2015 MALIBU AT THE BEGINING OF THE YEAR I LOVED THE CAR BEFORE MY ACCIDENT AND AFTER MY ACCIDENT AND TAKING A TOTAL LOSS I BOUGHT THE EXACT CAR AGAIN I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE CAR MORESO AFTER 
I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT THE EXTENDED SIZE ESPECIALLY WHEN PARKING BUT THE PARKING ASSISTS AND NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS VIBRATING SEAT HAVE HELPED TO EASE MY MIND 
I WAS NEVER DEMONSTRATED ON ANY CONTROLS!
I WAS NOT AWARE THAT MY AUDIO SYSTEM DID NOT HAVE A CD PLAYER THE FIRST MODEL I SAW HAD ONE AND I THOUGHT THAT MY VEHICLE WOULD HAVE ONE BUT IT DOESN T I AM IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING AN IPOD SO I COULD LISTEN TO THE MUSIC I ENJOY THE ENTERTAI 
I WAS NOT INFORMED OF HOW EXPENSIVE IT ITS FOR ME TO HAVE USE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BASICALLY I WOULD HAVE TO SPEND AROUND $200 PER YEAR MINIMUM TO HAVE USE OF THE NAV SYSTEM I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT THAT TOYOTA DOES NOT CHARGE TO HAVE USE O 
I WAS OVERWHELMED AT FIRST W/ THE WHOLE SYSTEM MY SON SET THINGS UP FOR ME AND GAVE ME A TUTORIAL HE HAD NO TROUBLE!
I WAS PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE GRAPHICS VOICE PROMPTS ROUTE GUIDANCE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS ETC WORK BEAUTIFULLY THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST PLEASANT SURPRISES WITH THE VEHICLE 
I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT WHILE DRIVING ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY I 75 I DON T FEEL LIKE I M IN A SMALL VEHICLE THE FIAT HANDLES EXCEPTIONALLY WELL AT 70+ MPH 
I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO NOTE THAT THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORK FROM THE CENTER AND SWEEP OUTWARDS I THINK THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE TRADITIONAL METHOD THE NEW WAY ALLOWS FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS OF VISIBILITY TO BE COVERED VERY EFFICI 
I WAS PREVIOUSLY USING GARMIN S TOP OF THE LINE DEVICE WHICH WAS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY IN MY OPINION THE AUDI S CONTROLS & GRAPHICS ALTHOUGH GOOD JUST DON T COMPARE TO THE EASE OF USE 
I WAS PROMISED THE SIRUS RADIO BEFORE I BOUGHT MY DODGE JOURNEY AND WHEN I GOT IT HOME I COULD NOT EVER FIND IT I HAVE THE DODGE JOURNEY SE DO I OR DON T I HAVE THIS FEATURE BECAUSE I AM SURE I WOULD ENJOY IT? PLEASE RESPOND ! ALSO DON T I G 
I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM I HAD BEEN SPOILED WITH MY PRIOR 2003 ACURA TLS THAT HAD A BOSE SOUND SYSTEM IT S ALMOST LIKE THEY WENT OUT OF THE WAY TO MAKE THIS ONE INFERIOR TO THAT SO PEOPLE WOULD FEEL PRESSU 
I WAS REALLY SURPRISED BY HOW WELL THE DRIVER CAN SEE THE ROAD THE FEELING IS THAT OF A MUCH LARGER VEHICLE 
I WAS SHOCKED AT THE POOR SOUND QUALITY OF THE RADIO SINCE IT IS A BOSE AND I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH BOSE THERE IS TOO MUCH BASE AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADJUST THE SETTINGS TO CORRECT THAT 
I WAS SHOCKED THAT IN TODAY S DAY AND AGE THE VEHICLE DID NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN I ASKED THE DEALER IF I COULD GET ONE INSTALLED HE SAID I COULD ONLY GET IT AS PART OF AN UPGRADE PACKAGE THAT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $3 000 VERY DISAP 
I WAS SHOPPING FOR A JEEP WITH EXTRA INTERIOR SPACE I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW NICE THE SOUNDS SYSTEM WAS 
I WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH THE SOLID QUALITY AND QUIETNESS AND SMOOTH RIDE OF MY ESCAPE THAT I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE THAT NIGHT IN WHITE FOR MY WIFE TO DRIVE AND TRADED IN HER OLD BUICK REGAL 
I WAS SURPRISED AT THE LACK OF A TOUCH SCREEN 
I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND SUCH A GOOD ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM ON A VEHICLE IN THIS PRICE RANGE IT S SOMETHING THAT MANY OTHER MANUFACTURERS WILL ONLY DREAM TO ACHIEVE AT IN A VEHICLE LIKE THIS ONE 
I WAS TOLD ALL C 300 MO DEAL HAVE REAR CAMERA AFTER PURCHASING I DON T HAVE ONE
I WAS TOLD THAT THE SOUND OF MY VOICE ON MY BLUE TOOTH IN THIS CAR IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT WAS IN MY 2013 SONATA 
I WAS TOLD THAT WHEN I SPOKE USING HANDSFREE IT IS HEARD VERY LOUD ON THE OTHER END 
I WAS UNABLE TO CONNECT TO A NEW DEVICE THROUGH THE BLUE TOOTH AND DID NOT HAVE THE BOOKLET WITH ME SO WAS NEVER ABLE TO DO SO 
I WAS UNABLE TO FIND A VEHICLE THAT MET MY OTHER CRITERIA THAT HAD LANE DEPARTURE WARNING BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND FORWARD COLLISION WARNING IN MY AREA THOSE WERE OPTIONS I DESIRED BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THERE WERE OTHER THINGS COLOR Z71 
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DENALI HAD NAVIGATION WITH OR WITHOUT SIRUS BUT IT DOES NOT

I WOULD LOVE IT IF THE SATELLITE RADIO DISPLAY SCROLLED THROUGH THE STATION NAME ARTIST AND SONG TITLE

I WOULD LOVE MORE SURROUND SOUND
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A VISOR EXTENSION LIKE ON THE CHEVY TRUCKS AND VANS JUST A PIECE THAT SLIDES OUT TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE VISIBILITY AS A TALL PERSON THE VISOR DOES NOT REACH FAR ENOUGH WHEN USING IT ON THE DOOR SIDE TO EFFECTIVELY BLOCK TH

I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE SYSTEM TEXT MESSAGE FOR ME WHILE DRIVING IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH SOME SYSTMS MAY HAVE THAT OPTION I AM UNAWARE IF MY SYSTEM HAS THIS OPTION 
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MANUFACTURERS STEER AWAY FROM BUILT IN NAV SYSTEMS THEY ARE A COSTLY REDUNDANT ADDITION IN TODAY S WORLD AND IT AMOUNTS TO AN UNNECESSARY GRAB OF THE CONSUMERS DOLLARS EUROS WHATEVER FOR THIS ITEM IN ORDER TO OBTAIN O 
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS VEHICLE COME STANDARD WITH BLIND SPOT MONITORING COLLISION AVOIDANCE ALERT SYSTEM AND/OR LANE DEPARTURE WARNING 
I WOULD MAKE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA STANDARD IT IS HARD TO SEE IN THE BACK WITH THE CONVERTIBLE TOP ON 
I WOULD NOT BUY A CAR WITHOUT SIRIUSXM ANYMORE 
I WOULD NOT CHANGE ANYTHING 
I WOULD OF LIKED THE VOLUME CONTROL KNOB ON THE RADIO CONSOLE TO HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIGGER IT FEELS TOO SMALL 
I WOULD PREFER A BLIND SPOT MIRROR IN THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR LIKE THE ONE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE I THOUGHT IT UNUSUAL TO HAVE THAT BLIND SPOT MIRROR ONLY ON THE DRIVER S SIDE!
I WOULD PREFER A DIFFERENT SIGNAL FROM THE BLIND SPOT WARNING MY BMW 5 SERIES USED A VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL TO WARN OF A VEHICLE IN MY BLIND SPOT I FIND THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THE AUDIBLE SIGNAL IN THE MERCEDES CAN OBSCURED BY AMB

I WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION AND ALL OF THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL BUT THE MODEL CAME WITH IT INCLUDED 
I WOULD PREFER THAT MY REAR VIEW MIRROR DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THE NIGHT TIME VISION THING I PREFER NORMAL VIEW OUT OF MY REAR VIEW MIRROR I AM CONSTANTLY TURNING THE MODE OFF 
I WOULD PREFER THAT THE WIPERS WERE MORE HIDDEN UNTIL USED 
I WOULD PREFER THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS BE A LITTLE BIGGER NOT TAPERED 
I WOULD PREFER THE SCREEN NOT BE ILLUMINATED WHEN NOT IN USE INSTEAD ON ALL THE TIME 
I WOULD PREFER THE SUN VISOR TO UNHOOK AND BE ABLE TO EXTEND OUT A LITTLE MORE 
I WOULD PREFER TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE RADIO OFF WHEN I WANT TO INSTEAD OF NO VOICE AND TURNING OFF THE SCREEN
I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE ROTARY KNOBS INSTEAD OF THE TOUCHSCREEN FOR THE AUDIO CONTROLS IT IS DANGEROUS IN MY OPINION TO HAVE TO LOOK DOWN AT THE SCREEN AWAY FROM THE ROAD 
I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE LIGHT WARNING FOR A BLIND SPOT VEHICLE TO BE IN THE OUTSIDE MIRROR RATHER THAN BEING PLACED ON THE FRONT DOORS 
I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE WINDSHIELD WIPER LIQUID DISPERSED IN A WIDE MIST RATHER THAN A SINGLE SPRAY SPRAY IS TAD TOO HIGH AND IT DOES NOT MAKE THE WINDSHIELD WET ENOUGH 
I WOULD PREFER TO KNOW WHAT TIME I M GOING TO ARRIVE AT MY DESTINATION RATHER THAN HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE ME PERHAPS I CAN CHANGE THIS SETTING HAVEN T FINISHED READING THE THICK MANUAL I WOULD LIKE MORE OF THE MAIN STREETS LABELED & FEWER SIDE S 
I WOULD PROBABLY GIVE THIS AN OUTSTANDING 7 IF THE HEADPHONES WOULD WORK I HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH THE VOICE COMMAND BUT I DON T USE ANY OF THIS VERY OFTEN SO IT IS HARD TO RATE
I WOULD RATE THE AUDIO SYSTEM HIGHER IF THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTED WITH MY PHONE REGULARLY 
I WOULD RATE THIS AS AT LEAST AN 8 BUT THERE S NO CD PLAYER I HAVE OVER 500 CDS AND WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE ONE AS OF YET MY DEALER SAYS THERE S NONE AVAILABLE I ACTUALLY WOULDN T HAVE BOUGHT THIS CAR IF I D HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS NO CD PLAYE 
I WOULD RATHER HAVE HID HEADLIGHTS THAN THE LED HEADLIGHTS LEDS ARE NO WHERE NEAR AS BRIGHT AS HID HEADLIGHTS 
I WOULD RATHER HAVE KNOBS FOR VOLUME AND TUNING RATHER THAN TOUCH CONTROL
I WOULD RATHER HAVE PANDORA THAT SIRIUS
I WOULD RATHER HAVE REAR ENTERTAINMENT LOCATED IN REAR HEADRESTS NAVIGATION IS NOT AT ALL USER FRIENDLY I CANNOT EVEN GET TO THE POINT WHERE THE ADDRESS CAN BE INPUT VERY IRRITATING 
I WOULD RATHER HAVE WIPER BLADES THAT MOVE SIDE TO SIDE INSTEAD OF FROM THE INSIDE OUT 
I WOULD RATHER THE SYSTEM NOT START AUTOMATICALLY IT STARTLES ME TO HAVE MY IPOD BEGIN PLAYING AS I M BACKING OUT OF MY GARAGE I AM CAPABLE OF TURNING THINGS ON WHEN I WANT THEM ON!
I WOULD RATHER TO HAVE TOUCH SCREEN INSTEAD OF WHEEL INTERFACE TAKE FOREVER TO ENTER ADDRESS AND NAVIGATE CROSS HAIR 
I WOULD REALLY BE EXCITED IF THE CAR HAS INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE THE DEALER THAT I PURCHASED FROM TOLD ME THAT IT WAS COMING AVAILABLE BUT I AM NOT SURE IF HE REALLY KNEW 
I WOULD REALLY LIKE DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS AND AUTOMATIC REAR HATCH CLOSING
I WOULD REALLY LIKE OPTIONAL FOG LAMPS IN THE F SPORT 
I WOULD REALLY LIKE SOME FOG LIGHTS ESPECIALLY LED HEADLIGHTS AND FOG LIGHTS ALSO LED TAIL LAMPS AND LED REAR SIGNAL LAMPS 
I WOULD RECOMMEND REPLACING HEADLIGHTS WITH HID OR LED LIGHTING SYSTEMS 
I WOULD SAY THE VOICE RECOGNITION IF ONLY IT RECOGNIZES/RESPONDS BETTER/MORE CONSISTENTLY THEREFORE I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THE ABILITY TO ACCESS MY PERSONAL LIBRARY OF MUSIC FROM A FLASHDRIVE TO BE USED IN MY TRUCK WITHOUT THE NEED FOR AN MP3/IPOD D 
I WOULD SPEED UP THE RESPOSE TIME OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION SERVICE AND TAKE ALL THE STUPID BUTTONS AND PADDLES OFF OF THE STEERING WHEEL 
I WOULD STILL LIKE THERE TO BE A BLIND SPOT MIRROR IN ADDITION TO THE LIGHTED INDICATOR ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
I WOULD SUGGEST THERE BE MORE PLUGS AVAILABLE TO HOOK UP PHONES AND OTHER OUTSIDE DEVISES 
I WOULD SUGGEST YOU LOOK AT FORDS SIDE MIRRORS AND FIND A WAY TO COPY THEM THEY ARE OUTSTANDING
I WOULD THINK THAT A MERCEDES WOULD CARRY A BETTER QUALITY OF SOUND FROM THE SPEAKERS AND THAT THE VOLUME CONTROL S COULD BE PLACED BETTER 
I WOULD USE THE ENTERTAINMENT STUFF IN THIS CAR MORE IF I COULD DRIVE IT BUT I CANT BECAUSE THE FIRST AND SECOND TRANSMISSION DOESN T WORK THEREFOR I DRIVE SOMETHING ELSE AT THE TIME
I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO HAVE A COMPASS IN THE VEHICLE TELLING ME WHAT DIRECTION I AM GOING IN 
I WOULDN T BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO SAY THAT I FEEL INDESTRUCTIBLE IN MY XTERRA BUT IT S PRETTY CLOSE THE COMBINATION OF THE RUGGED EXTERIOR AND THE SOLID BUILT FEEL IT HAS IT S HARD TO THINK THAT I COULD GET STRANDED BY SOMETHING OTHER THAN A TIR 
I WOULDN T PUT MY FAMILY SAFETY IN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE CASE OF A ACCIDENT I AM CONFIDENT MY FAMILY WILL BE SAFE AND UNINJURED
I WREAKED THIS CAR ONE WEEK AFTER PURCHASE AND TWO AIR BAGS DEPLOYED SOME BRUSING BUT NO SERIOUS INJURY 
ICC
ICE BUILT UP UNDERNEATH VEHICLE
ICE TENDS TO BUILD UP ON THE WIPERS WHILE DRIVING ON COLD AND SNOWY WEATHER 
ICE WILL FORM ON WIPERS WHILE DRIVING UNDER WINTER CONDITIONS RESULTING IN IMPROPER CLEANING OF WINDSHIELD 
ICONS ARE EASILY SEEN
ICONS ON STEERING WHEEL
ID ING OF THE PHONE ONCE CONNECTED
IDEAL WOULD BE TO HAVE NAVIGATION APP LIKE WAZE BE CONNECTED TO THE CAR VIDEO AND AUDIO SYSTEMS
IDRIVE CONTROLLER
IDRIVE HARD TO USE WHY NOT USING A TOUCH SCREEN????
IDRIVE INTERFACE IS HORRIBLE THESE DAYS IT SHOULD BE A TOUCH SCREEN BUT EVEN THE CONTROLS ARE POORLY IMPLEMENTED HAVE A LOOK AT FORD S SYNC UI IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW TO DO IN VEHICLE CONTROLS 
IDRIVE IS INITIALLY CONFUSING AND HAS TOO MANY OPTIONS 
IDRIVE OVERALL IS A VERY ATTRACTIVE SYSTEM AND EASY TO OPERATE IT GENERALLY BLOWS OTHER MANUFACTURER S SYSTEMS OUT OF THE WATER 
IDRIVE SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY AND HAS A LEARNING CURVE TO IT 
IDRIVE SYSTEM VERY EASY TO USE SEAMLESS SMARTPHONE INTEGRATION
IF A PASSENGER IS SITTING IN THE REAR HE SHOULD SIT BEHIND THE DRIVER OR IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK USING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
IF ALL HEAD REST ARE UP RESTRICTS VISION ESPECIALLY THIRD ROW SEATS
IF ANYTHING I WOULD HAVE A TEN BAND EQUALIZER/ANALYZER 
IF BY COMMUNICATION YOU MEAN BLUETOOTH I THINK THAT IS AMAZING TECHNOLOGY 
IF CONNECTS TO MY IPHONE WITHOUT ME HAVING TO DO ANYTHING! IT S SUPER SIMPLE TO USE AND TO SWITCH BETWEEN AUDIO MODES RADIO/CD/IPOD 
IF DRIVERS SEAT IS VERY FAR BACK SIDE POSTS DO BLOCK SOME SIDE VISION TOO MUCH 
IF HEADRESTS ARE UP IN THE REAR SEAT THEY BLOCK SOME OF THE VIEWING ABILITY 
IF HONDA HAD PROVIDED A MANUAL TO EXPLAIN THE FEATURES OF THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS I AM SURE IT WOULD BE EASIER TO USE THE SYSTEMS AND LEARN MORE ABOUT EACH FEATURE 
IF I AM ON A PHONE CALL PRIOR TO GETTING INTO MY MKC AND AM CONNECTED TO MY BLUETOOTH EARPIECE AS SOON AS I START THE VEHICLE THE SYNC SYSTEM CONNECTS TO MY PHONE AND TAKES OVER THE CALL CONNECTING IT TO THE VEHICLE S SPEAKER PHONE ALTHOUGH TH 
IF I AM WEARING POLARIZED SUN GLASSES I CAN T SEE THE HEADS UP DISPLAY 
IF I CAN OPERATE THE SYSTEM ANY ONE CAN DO IT 
IF I COULD BE HIGHER IN THE DRIVERS SEAT BECAUSE I M SHORT I D BE BETTER ABLE TO SEE OUTSIDE
IF I COULD CHANGE ANYTHING I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER REAR VIEW MIRROR BE PLACED HIGHER ON THE WINDSHIELD SO THAT YOU CAN SEE WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION OUT THE FRONT FOR TALLER PEOPLE THE MIRROR LOCATION TENDS TO BLOCK YOUR LINE OF SIGHT AND REA 
IF I COULD CHANGE ANYTHING IT WOULD HAVE A SWITCH TO GO FROM COMFORT TO SPORT THE CAR FEELS LIKE IT IS SET TO SPORT ALL THE TIME 
IF I COULD JUST GET THIS VOICE REC SYSTEM FIGURED OUT I KNOW I HAVE TO RETURN TO THE DEALER AGAIN IT WILL BE FANTASTIC WHEN I GET SOME MORE EDUCATION BUT RIGHT NOW IT S A HUGE FEATURE/SELLING POINT/COST THAT S A TOTAL WASTE FOR ME 
IF I COULD SIT UP HIGHER AND LOOK OUT THE WINDOWS EASIER I D FEEL SAFER I LIKE TO SEE FOR REAL NOT JUST WITH A MIRROR OR CAMERA 
IF I COULD USE THE FEATURES AS ADVERTISED UVO ISSUES WITH PHONE 
IF I DIDN T HAVE THE REAR CAMERA I WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH REAR VISIBILITY HENCE MY 6 RATING WITH THE REAR CAMERA I WOULD GIVE IT A 9 
IF I GET TIRED OF HD FM I CAN USE INTERNET RADIO THROUGH MY SMART PHONE 
IF I HAD A NEWBORN I WOULD FEEL SAFE AND VERY CONFIDENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY OF THIS CAR 
IF I HAD KNOWN THE CAR I PICKED OUT DIDN T HAVE A CD PLAYER I WOULD HAVE OPTED FOR A DIFFERENT STYLE IF YOU PAY $20K FOR A CAR IT SHOULD HAVE A CD PLAYER!!!!!!!!!!!!! PAPERS HAD ALREADY BEEN SIGNED WHEN THIS WAS REALIZED 
IF I HAD THE BEATS AUDIO I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE GIVEN IT HIGHER RATINGS 
IF I HAD TO PICK ONE THING ABOUT THE VEHICLE THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT THIS WOULD BE THE CATEGORY VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING IS EXCELLENT HOWEVER VISIBILITY FOR PARKING AND BEING ABLE TO DETERMINE WHERE THE CORNERS OF THE VEHICLE ARE SO YOU DON T 
IF I HAVE A PASSENGER IN THE CAR IT IS HARD TO SEE WELL AROUND THEM NOT SURE IF IT IS ME OR THE WAY THE FRONT SEATS ARE 
IF I LIKED TO LISTEN TO MUSIC OR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT WHILE DRIVING I SUPPOSE THE SPEAKERS COULD SURELY BE OF A BETTER QUALITY 
IF I M MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN I DON T REALLY FEEL THAT I HAVE A GOOD VISIBILITY FROM THE LEFT
IF I PUT THE SIT LOWEST AS POSSIBLE I CAN REACH THE BREAK BUT I DO NOT HAVE VISION FROM OUTSIDE IF I PUT THE SIT HIGH I CAN ALMOST NOT REACH THE BREAK ONLY WITH MY TIP TOES MY DODGE DOES NOT HAS BREAK ADJUSTMENT!!!!
IF I SHUT OFF ANY SAFETY FEATURE I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO STAY SHUT OFF UNTIL I TURN IT BACK ON 
IF IT COULD BE HANDS FREE
IF IT COULD BE SIMPLE TO OPERATE FOR EVERYONE EVEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE LITTLE TECHNOLOGY BACKGROUND 
IF IT COULD RECOGNIZE MY VOICE IT WOULD BE A 9
IF IT DIDN T DEFAULT TO IPHONE SOURCE FOR MUSIC WHEN PLUGGING IT IN TO CHARGE
IF IT HAD THE ABILITY TO BE CONTROLLED THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL 
IF IT HAS NAVIGATION IN REAL TIME I DON T KNOW ABOUT IT I FIND MY PHONE NAVIGATION IS MORE USEFUL THAT THE CARS SYSTEM 
IF IT HAS REAL TIME TRAFFIC I DON T KNOW IT 
IF IT RECOGNIZED MY VOICE THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER!
IF IT WAS BUILT THAT YOU DID NOT FEEL THE BUMPS WHEN GO OVER THEM AND THE REAR WIPER WAS A LONGER ABOUT 6 TO 12 INCHES IT WOULD BE HEAVENLY 
IF IT WAS NOT FOR VOICE RECOGNITION BEING SO BAD AND AND GPS BEING SLOW IT WOULD BE PERFECT
IF IT WEREN T FOR THE BLIND SPOT ASSIST THIS CAR WOULD VERY VERY HARD TO DRIVE IN TRAFFIC 
IF IT WORKED IT MIGHT BE OK ALSO YOU NEED TO UPDATE THE NAVIGATION GPS THE DIRECTIONS ARE 20 YEARS OUT OF DATE FOR ASHEVILLE AND CHARLOTTE NC I HAVE TO USE GOOGLE MAPS ON MY IPHONE FIX THE FREEZING UP PROBLEM ON THE TOUCH SCREEN 
IF IT WORKS IT S GREAT!
IF MY LIGHTS ARE ON DURING THE DAY THE AUDIO SCREEN IS HARD TO SEE SCAN FEATURE IS HARD TO ACCESS NEED BETTER MANUAL FOR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
IF NAVIGATION IS ON AND YOU RECEIVE A CALL THE MAP DISPLAY DISAPPEARS AND VOICE NAVIGATION CANNOT BE HEARD THE MAP DISPLY SHOULD GO BACK ONCE YOU ANSWER THE CALL I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND MISSED A TURN OR EXIT 
IF NOT FOR REAR VIEW CAMERA I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OUT OF REAR WINDOW TO PARALLEL PARK 
IF NOT FOR THE DRIVING ASSIST IT WOULD BE HARD TO SAFELY CHANGE LANES SOME FOR BACKING UP IF NOT FOR THE REAR CAMERA 
IF NOT FOR THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS CAR AS THE VISIBILITY THROUGH THE VERY SMALL REAR WINDOWS WOULD PRESENT A PROBLEM FOR ME ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS DARK 
IF NOT FOR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IT IS HARD TO JUDGE THE REAR END OF THE CAR AS YOU CANNOT SEE IT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK 
IF ONLY THE VISIBILITY WAS BETTER FOR CHANGING LANES I WOULD ADORE THIS CAR!
IF ONLY THE VOICE CONTROLS WOULD WORK I WOULD GIVE IT A 10/10 
IF POSSIBLE THE TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS TO BE A BIT MORE SENSITIVE TO TOUCH I HAVE DIFFICULTY SLIDING THROUGH THE PRESET STATIONS WHILE DRIVING 
IF POSSIBLE TO USE THE SAME SOFTWARE THAT GARMIN USES FOR MAPS AND NAVIGATION
IF POSSIBLE WOULD LIKE THE WIPERS TO CLEAN MORE AREA
IF REAR SEATS ARE UP THE VISIBILITY IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS LIMITED WITH THE SEATS DOWN THE VISIBILITY IS GOOD 
IF ROAD IS NOT AT 90 DEGREE ANGLE IT IS HARD TO SEE TO THE LEFT
IF SOMEONE SHOWED ME HOW TO USE EVERYTHING 
IF THE 3RD SEAT HEADRESTS ARE UP DRIVER VISIBILITY IS GREATLY REDUCED
IF THE BLUETOOTH WOULD BE FIXED IT WOULD BE PERFECT 
IF THE CAR CANNOT PERFORM TO THE MANUFACTURERS SPECS IN REGARD TO USING THE USB PORTS IN MY VEHICLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BEST QUALITY AUDIO WHEN PLAYING MUSIC I RATE THAT UNACCEPTABLE 
IF THE CAR IS SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THERE IS A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT WITH THE USE OF SEAT BELTS WHY CAN T THE PASSENGER HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITHOUT HAVING TO STOP THE CAR TO PUT IN A DESTINATION??????????? 
IF THE CAR WASN T SO SHORT I MAY HAVE RAN OVER SOMEONE BY NOW THE REAR DRIVER S SIDE & PASSENGER SIDE CORNERS OF THE CAR ARE TOTALLY INVISIBLE THE DRIVER REAR VIEW HAS A FISH EYE SECTION OF MIRROR WHICH IS VITAL & FAIRLY GENIUS IN MY OPINI 
IF THE CLARITY OF OUTGOING PHONE CALLS WERE IMPROVED SOMEHOW REMOVING THE TIN CAN SOUND OF THE PHONE SYSTEM 
IF THE CONTROL PANEL IN THE APP SECTION SAYS TRAFFIC OR WEATHER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT WITHOUT HD SERVICE IF ITS THERE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT EVEN AFTER MY FREE TRIAL WITH XM RADIO IS UP NEVER WORKED SO I DON T NOW HOW GOOD IT IS 
IF THE DRIVER SEAT WAS VERTICALLY ADJUSTABLE IT WOULD BE EASIER TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK 
IF THE NAVIGATION SYTEM WERE TO HAVE ACCESS TO NET FOR SEARCH LOCATION OF POINTS OF INTEREST GOOGLE MAPS 
IF THE NAVIGATION WORKED PROPERLY AND VOICE COMMAND RECOGNITION WAS BETTER AND IF THE USB PORT WAS HIGHER TECH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 10S ACROSS THE BOARD WHEN MY NAV WORKS PROPERLY IT IS AWESOME BUT IT ONLY WORKS 30% OF THE TIME AND THAT IS RIDI 
IF THE PASSENGER AIR BAG IS DETECTING A PASSENGER IN THAT SEAT I BELIEVE ALL CONTROLS FOR ALL FEATURES INCLUDING NAVIGATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE USED I UNDERSTAND NOT ALLOWING THE DRIVER TO DO SUCH THINGS WHILE VEHICLE IS MOVING BUT IT WOULD 
IF THE PASSENGER SEAT IS POSITIONED JUST RIGHT I CANT SEE OUT THE REAR RIGHT PASSENGER WINDOW WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT WHEN REVERSING IN SOME SITUATIONS 
IF THE PHONE WOULD CONNECT AND SYNC VIA BLUETOOTH MORE CONSISTENTLY AND EASILY AND IF IT WERE EASIER TO CALIBRATE THE VOICE CONTROL SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND ME
IF THE READIO CAN TELL ME ARTIST AND SONG ON XM AND ON MY IPOD AND OUR LOCAL RADIO STATIONS DO BROADCAST ARTIST AND SONG MY 2006 AUDII SEES THIS INFO WHY CAN T MY SUBARU TELL ME ARTIST AND SONG ON FM?
IF THE REAR WAS MORE BOXY IT WOULD BE EASIER TO SEE OUT OF 
IF THE REAR WINDOW WAS BIGGER IT WOULD BE AMAZING 
IF THE SATELITE RADIO DID NOT CUT OUT I D HAVE GIVEN IT A 10 HERE 
IF THE SEAT WENT HIGHER IT WOULD HELP AND THE BLIND SPOTS NEED BIGGER WINDOWS I DONT LIKE RELYING ON NOISE TO WARN
IF THE SUN VISOR COULD TELESCOPE BACK WHEN PUSHED AGAINST THE SIDE WINDOW IT WOULD HELP TREMENDOUSLY 
IF THE VEHICLE HAD SOME OF THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURES THAT WOULD IMPROVE THINGS OTHERWISE THE VEHICLE HAS GOOD VISIBILITY 
IF THE VOICE RECOGNITION WASN T AS HORRIBLE AS IT IS AT ACTUALLY WORKING OR THE NAVIGATION MENUS BE SO DIFFICULT I WOULD HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT ALL OTHER ASPECTS ARE AWESOME 
IF THE VOLUME BUTTON WAS BIGGER
IF THERE ARE PASSENGERS IN THE BACK IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE THE REAR
IF THERE IS A BETTER MICROPHONE FOR HANDS FREE CALLING?
IF THERE IS A PASSENGER IN THE CAR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD WORK MAYBE BE WEIGHT CONTROLLED JUST AN IDEA 
IF THERE IS A PASSENGER IN THE SEAT IT CAN BLOCK THE VIEW BECAUSE OF THE WINDOW DESIGN 
IF THERE IS AN ADULT PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT THE DRIVER HAS QUITE A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT TO THE RIGHT HAVING SAID THAT THE SIDE MIRRORS WITH THE EXTRA LITTLE CONVEX CORNERS DO HELP A LOT WHEN CHANGING LANES HOWEVER THEY DO NOT HELP WHEN 
IF THERE IS ONE PROBLEM THAT I EXPERIENCED RECENTLY IF ANOTHER VEHICLE IS APPROACHING TO MY LEFT UNLESS IT IS VERY CLOSE TO ME THE MIRROR DOES NOT PICK UP THE APPROACHING VEHICLE IT MAY BE MY FAULT BECAUSE OF THE WAY I HAVE MY MIRROR POSITIO 
IF THERE IS TRAFFIC IT DOESN T GIVE YOU MULTI OPTIONS OF DETOURS UNTIL IT S TOO LATE 
IF THERE WAS A SMALL BUMP ON THE DOOR COLUM SUCH THAT THE SEAT BELT WAS AWAY FROM THE COLUMN AT THAT LOCATION IT WOULD BE EASIER TO RETRIVE IT WHEN PUTTING THE BELT ON 
IF THERE WAS A WAY TO ADJUST THE RINGTONE OR THE RINGTONE VOLUME CURRENT RING TONE STARTLES YOU ON AN INCOMING CALL AND IS MUCH LOUDER THAN VOLUME SET ON RADIO 
IF THERE WAS ANY LEAST FAVORITE ASPECT I WOULD BE DRIVING SOMETHING ELSE 
IF THERE WERE NO BLIND SPOTS IT WOULD BE AN AMAZING CAR 
IF THEY COULD REDUCE THE WIDTH OF THE WINDSHIELD PILLARS IT WOULD HELP SIDE VISION
IF THIS INCLUDES THE RADIO RECEPTION THEN IT SUCKS!!!!
IF TRYING TO MAKE A PHONE CALL BY USING THE VOICE CONNECTION IT SEEMS TO HAVE DIFICULT UNDERSTANDING CLEARLY OR MY ENGLISH MAY NOT BE CLEAR ENOUGH OR TO LOUD ITS GETTING BETTER BUT AT TIMES NOT GOOD SO THEN I PICK UP MY I PHONE AND FIND THE # AND 
IF VEHICLE IS RUNNING AND YOU GET IN YOU CAN NOT CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH UNTIL THE CAR HAS BEEN SHUT OFF AND THEN TURNED BACK ON
IF VOICE RECOGNITION UNDERSTOOD WHAT I AM SAYING IT WOULD HAVE THE HIGHEST MARKS 
IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IT IS NOT GOOD IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SOUND THAT COMES OUT OF THE RADIO I LOVE IT 
IF YA SPEND 40 GRAND ON A CAR THE SPEAKERS SHOULD BE ALOT BETTER POOR AUDIO QUALITY
IF YOU ARE AT A STOP SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE IF TRAFFIC APPROACHING BECAUSE OF FRAME AND SIDE MIRROR 
IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO IPAD THAT YOU SHOULDN T HAVE TO LISTEN TO RADIO TOO!
IF YOU ARE SHORT AND CANNOT RAISE THE SEAT HIGH ENOUGH THE DRIVER S SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR OBSTRUCTS YOUR LEFT TURN MOVEMENT VISIBILITY I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE HAVING THAT PROBLEM SINCE THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF THE DRIVERS SEAT DOE 
IF YOU COULD DISPLAY THE SMARTPHONE SCREEN ON THE DASHBOARD SCREEN THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL ESP WHEN NAVIGATING 
IF YOU COULD OFFER BACKUP CAMERA STANDARD LIKE HONDA THAT WOULD BE GREAT
IF YOU DONT HAVE A SMART PHONE MOST FEATURES ARE NOT AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE AN IPAD AND INTERNET ACCESS CAR USES ONLY BLUETOOTH AND IGNORES BUILT IN FEATGURES OF AN IPAD WITH DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNITION OF CELL PHONE OFTEN OTHER FEATURES BE 
IF YOU DONT USE THE KEY WORDS IT DOESNT WORK YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH TOO MANY STEPS
IF YOU GET THE NAVIGATION SCREEN ITS PRETTY BIG IF YOU DON T GET THE NAVIGATION THE SCREEN IS TINY!
IF YOU WANT OR NEED IT IT S THERE!
IF YOUR WINDSHEILD CAN DARKEN AND LITEN WITH CHANGING LITE CONDITIONS BY IT SELF

IMPROVED SOUND QUALITY WHEN USING THE PHONE BETTER SPEECH RECOGNITION WHEN ENTERING DESTINATIONS 
IMPROVED SOUND/RADIO QUALITY
IMPROVED SPEAKERS SOUND QUALITY IS NOTHING SPECIAL AND SHOULD BE 
IMPROVED SUN VISORS ARE NICE
IMPROVED VOICE RECOGNITION 
IMPROVED VOICE RECOGNITION FROM PREVIOUS LEXUS NAVIGATION SYSTEMS 
IMPROVED VOICE RECOGNITION MIS INTERPRETS ADDRESSES 
IMPROVEMENT BY HAVING AN AUX PORT OUTSIDE OF THE GLOVEBOX FOR AN ADDITIONAL OPTION 
IMPROVEMENT ON BLIND SPOT
IMPROVEMENTS ON THE BLUE TOOTH
IMPROVEMENTS WITH THE BLIND SPOT HAVE WORKED!!! WHEN I DROVE A CHARGER WHEN THEY CAME BACK OUT THE BLIND SPOTS WERE HORRIFIC!!! MUCH MUCH BETTER! OUTSTANDING HEADLIGHTS!!!!
IMPROVES GRAPHICS AND INTERFACE
IMPROVING THE SPEECH INPUT FOR ROUTE GUIDANCE
IMPROVING THE VOICE COMMANDS
IMPUTING DATE TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
IN A TECH PACKAGE EQUIPPED CAR THE 6 SPEAKER SOUND SEEMS LOWER END NO SUBWOOFER
IN A WIND DAY FEEL THE CAR IS A LITTLE LIGHT TO DRIVE EASY TO MOVE WITH THE WIND 
IN A WORLD OF SUVS IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE ABLE TO SEE FORWARD THROUGH THE WINDOWS OF THE VEHICLE AHEAD OF ME AGAIN I AM ABLE TO ANTICIPATE SLOWING TRAFFIC AHEAD NOW AND FEEL ON AN EVEN KEEL WITH VEHICLES THAT SURROUND ME ON LA S FREEWAYS DROVE 
IN ADDITION TO GOOD VISIBILITY THE BLIND ASSIST SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT AND VERY USEFUL 
IN ADDITION TO THE BACK UP CAMERA HOW ABOUT A FRONT ONE FOR PARKING???? CAD HAD ONE 10 11 YEARS AGO THAT I GUESS NEVER TOOK OFF 
IN AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SIDE ASSIST
IN AN ALTERED MODEL SUCH AT THE TRD PRO THE JBL SPEAKERS WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE ADDITION 
IN AN UNEXPECTED BLACK ICE SITUATION I EXPERIENCED AN EXTREME NEED FOR A STEERING CORRECTION AND THE VEHICLE RESPONDED VERY WELL I WAS CONCERNED THAT AN OFF ROAD EXCURSION INTO DEEP SNOW WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN BUT THE VEHICLE STAYED ON THE PAVEME 
IN AN UPGRADE FROM THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM I USED IN MY LAST BMW YOU CAN NOW USE THE SCROLL WHEEL TO WRITE USING YOUR FINGER RATHER THAN TURNING AND TWISTING THE WHEEL IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS TO ENTER INFORMATION 
IN BAD WEATHER THE CAR SLIDES ALL OVER ROAD
IN BAD WEATHER THE REAR WIPERS DON T CLEAR OFF ENOUGH OF THE BACK WINDOW 
IN BLUETOOTH MODE THE CELL PHONE SIGNAL BREAKS UP MORE THAN ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED 
IN BRIGHT SUN LIGHT THERE IS A REFLECTION OF THE DASH BOARD IN THE WIND SHIELD
IN BRIGHT SUN THE SIDE LIGHTING OF VEHICLE APPROACHING IS DIFFICULT TO SEE 
IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT HARD TO SEE RADIO CONSOLE
IN CABIN MICROPHONE IS NOISY TO PHONE CALL RECIPIENT
IN CALL SOUND AUDIO QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED THE SOUND QUALITY OF CALLER OR PERSON YOU HAVE CALLED COULD BE CLEARER 
IN CAR MICROPHONE IS POOR QUALITY MY MOBILE PHONE CONNECTIONS CANNOT HEAR ME CLEARLY 
IN CAR NAVIGATION WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO BEAT AN IPHONE FOR NAVIGATION UNTIL IT IS AS RESPONSIVE AND TOUCH DEPENDENT AS THE SAME 
IN COLD TEMPERATURES AND WHEN THE CAR IS MOVING THE WINDSHIELD FLUID DOESN T SPRAY ABOVE THE WIPERS IT S USELESS WHEN I NEED IT MOST 
IN COLD TEMPS WINDSHIELD WIPER DUCTS GATHER LOTS OF ICE WITH THEIR PLACEMENT MAKING THEM HARD TO REACH AND CLEAN THEREFORE UNABLE TO USE FLUID FOR LONG DURATIONS AT TIMES 
IN COMING CALL CLARITY POOR
IN COMPARISON TO OTHER VEHICLES OF THIS CLASS THE BRAKES DO NOT FEEL AS SOLID AND STOPPING DISTANCE SEEMS A LITTLE LONG I ONLY HAVE 1500 MILES AND I HOPE THIS WILL IMPROVE 
IN CONTROL APPS ARE USELESS JUST USING MY IPHONE IS MORE CONVENIENT
IN CONTROL APS ARE A JOKE CAN T BELIEVE THEY CHARGE YOU FOR WHAT SHOULD BE BASIC IN A 80000 CAR
IN ECO MODE AWD AND TRACTION CONTROL PROVIDE GREAT CONTROL IN SNOW HARD TO BELIEVE THIS IS THE SAME SPORTS CAR I TESTED ON DRY ROADS I LOVE HAVING THIS CHOICE 
IN GENERAL IT IS EASY TO USE AND NOT DIFFICULT TO LEARN THE OPERATION OF COMPONENTS 
IN GENERAL TERMS I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH PCM BUT FOR SOME REASON I CAN SEE TEXT MESSAGES BUT NO E MAILS 
IN GENERAL THE CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE AND NOT INTUITIVE FOR EXAMPLE TURNING DOWN THE VOLUME OF THE NAVIGATION GUIDANCE IS A CHORE ALSO THE PHONE OVERRIDES THE GUIDANCE SYSTEM LEADING TO MISSED TURNS 
IN GENERAL THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEMS ARE BETTER THAN EXPECTED NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN METHODS TO NAME AND RECALL ROUTES AND WOULD PREFER MAPS SIMILAR TO GOOGLE S DISPLAYS 
IN GENERAL TOO COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT TO USE
IN HD MODE SOUND IS JUST REALLY BAD QUALITY OF SPEAKER IS BARELY OK I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE UPGRADE 
IN IS REALLY FUN TO DRIVE
IN MUDDLY ROAD CONDITIONS THE REAR WINDOW GET DIRTY FAST THIS IS TRUE WITH WINTER SNOW ON THE ROAD ALSO NO WATER TO WASH REAR WINDOW 
IN MY 2005 FORD EXPEDITION I REPLACED THE FACTORY RADIO WITH A KENWOOD DDX318 AND FOR NAVIGATION I USE A TOM TOM BOTH THOSE DEVICES ARE WAY SUPERIOR TO THE MICROSOFT PACKAGE FROM A UI FUNCTIONALITY ACCURACY AND COST PERSPECTIVE YOU CAN GET 
IN MY 2006 4 RUNNER THE SOUND SYSTEM WAS EXCEPTIONAL THIS VEHICLE S SOUND SYSTEM IS NOT AS GOOD BUT IT IS OK 
IN MY 2012 GENESIS THE SUN VISORS ADJUSTED SO THAT ONE COULD MOVE THEM SIDEWAYS TO COVER DOOR WINDOWS FROM THE SUN I MISS THIS FEATURE IN THE NEW GENESIS 
IN ONE CAR I HAD THERE WERE DOUBLE SUN VISORS ON EACH SIDE SO YOU COULD HAVE ONE IN THE WINDSHIELD AND ONE ON THE SIDE I REALLY LIKE THAT 
IN ORDER TO SEE EFFECTIVELY OVER THE DASH BOARD I HAVE TO RAISE THE SEAT UP TO IT S MAXIMUM HEIGHT WHEN I DO I BUMP MY HEAD GETTING INTO THE VEHICLE WHEN I M IN A RUSH AND FORGET THAT I RAISED THE SEAT 
IN ORDER TO USE THE GPS SYSTEM AND VISUALIZE IT IN THE SCREEN YOU HAVE TO BE HOOKED UP TO BRINGGO I DON T LIKE BRINGO I AM NOT ABLE TO USE THE UPS PORT WITH MY IPHONE TO SEE NAVIGATION WITH WAZEOR GOOGLE MAP IS THERE ANOTHER WAY WITHOUT BUSIN 
IN OUR LOCATION THE HD TRAFFIC DOESN T WORK DUE TO POPULATION OF OUR AREA? NOT A USEFUL APP FOR ME AS A RESULT 
IN OUR NEW SEQUOIA THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT OUT THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THE BACK PASSENGER HEADREST ON THE 3RD ROW SEATS BLOCKS THE BACK WINDOW WHEN CHANGING LANES THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS ON THIS NEW VEHICLE EVEN ON 
IN PAST VEHICLES THE PHONE CONNECTION WAS NEVER GOOD THIS SYSTEM IS AWESOME! PEOPLE DO NOT EVEN KNOW THAT I TALKING ON BLUETOOTH
IN REGARD TO THIS PART OF THE SURVEY I RATE THE CAR AVERAGE AS I WOULD RATE MOST ANY OTHER CAR I HAVE DRIVEN ALL CARS HAVE THEIR QUARKS AND PLUSES AND THIS CAR IS NO DIFFERENT 
IN SNOW COUNTRY THE WASHER NOZZLES ARE FOREVER FROZEN OR BURIED IN SNOW AND CRUD WORST ASPECT OF THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE WHICH IS OTHERWISE A JOY TO DRIVE 
IN SOME CASES LIKE FM STATIONS THE TOUCH BUTTONS ARE A LITTLE TO CLOSE TOGETHER 
IN SOME VEHICLES I VE DRIVEN THE A PILLAR IS INCONVENIENT AND GETS IN THE WAY THIS IS NOT THE CASE IN THE RAM AS I HAVE GREAT VISIBILITY LOOKING FORWARD AS WELL AS SIDE TO SIDE 
IN SPITE OF BLIND SPOT WARNING ETC THE BLIND SPOTS ITSELF ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TOO BIG FOR THE DRIVER IT THE TAHOE IS NOT TOWING TRAILERS ALL THE TIME THEN THE SHOCKS ARE TOO STIFF FOR DAILY DRIVE OTHER THAN TYNE FEELING OF RIDING IN A TRUCK IT 
IN TERMS OF THE REAR CAMERA THE OPTIONAL VIEWS FORWARD TOP DOWN REAR FULL VIEW ARE FANTASTIC ESPECIALLY FRONT VIEW FOR AVOIDING PARKING LOT HAZARDS TO THE FRONT FASCIA MY ONE QUIBBLE IS A THE CLARITY OF REAR CAMERA IT IS VERY GRAINY A 
IN THE BASE MODEL THERE IS NO INTERMITENT WIPER SYSTEM THIS IS A BIG NEGITIVE 
IN THE CAR I HAVE THE RADIO IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE IN THE SENTRA 
IN THE FUTURE THEY SHOULD CREATE A SOFTWARE FOR THE CAR THAT WILL THANSFER THE VIDEO CALL TO A MONITOR IN YOUR CAR SO U DON T HAVE TO HOLD THE PHONE IN YOUR HAND OR REJECT A VIDEO CALL AND WATCH VIDEOS AND MOVIES THAT WILL BE COOL USING THE INTER 
IN THE LS MODEL THE VISIBILITY CHANGING LANES WAS A BIT MORE INVOLVING AND TOOK LONGER TO BE SAFELY CLEARED TO CHANGE LANES THEN THE 07 COBALT I WAS USE TO ALTHOUGH THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS I PUT ON CLEARED THIS ISSUE UP 
IN THE MULTI DISPLAY PAGE THERE S 4 SLOTS THAT CAN BE USED TO INSERT 4 TELEPHONE NUMBERS THAT ARE MOST OFTEN USED THIS IS A VERY HANDY FEATURE 
IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I WISH IT SHOWED THE VEHICLE GOING FORWARD UP ON THE SCREEN RATHER THAN NORTH SOUTH EAST OR WEST I KNOW I AM NOT EXPLAINING THIS VERY WELL BUT ON MY DENALI THE CAR WAS ALWAYS HEADED UP ON THE SCREEN AND NOW IT SHOWS 
IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT IS HARD TO SEE THE INDICATOR YELLOW RED FOR HEAVY TRAFFIC BEFORE THEY USED YELLOW/RED CAR SYMBOLS 
IN THE NIGHT WHEN I DRIVE MY CAR IF I ADJUST THE FRONT LIGHT TO THE LOWEST POSITION I CAN T SEE FAR PLACE CLEARLY BUT IF I ADJUST THE LIGHTS HIGHER I CAN T SEE THE NEAR THINGS SEVERAL TIMES WHEN I MADE A U TURN OR CHANGED THE LANE I DIDN T R 
IN THE OLDER MODELS YOU CAN HOLD DOWN A RADIO STATION WHEN SETTING KEYS AND IT WILL PICK UP THE NAME OF THE STATION IE SPECTRUM OR PULSE IN THIS ONE IT ONLY PICKS UP THE STATION NUMBER AND YOU HAVE TO TYPE IN THE NAME IT S TIME CONSUMING AND C 
IN THE SITUATION WHERE I AM MERGING INTO A HIGHWAY LANE LEFT OF THE DRIVER S SIDE I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO TURN MY HEAD VERY FAR TO THE LEFT TO LOOK FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC IF I SIMPLY LOOK AT THE MIRRORS AND LOOK AT THE BLIND SPOT BUT SO 
IN THE SUN THE DISPLAY SCREEN IS HARD TO READ 
IN THE TOP TRIM LEVEL LIMITED HID HEADLIGHTS ARE STANDARD ON THE 3 5 6CYL AND NOT AVAILABLE ON THE 2 54CYL IN THE US IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS CANADA THEY ARE AVAILABLE NOT ACCEPTABLE IMO 
IN THIS DAY AN AGE ALL CARS SHOULD BE EQUIPED WITH SAFETY FEATURES WHEN CHANGING LANES AND REARVIEW CAMERAS AT NOT EXTRA COST
IN TOTAL THE VEHICLE AS ALL THE COMMUNICATION TOOLS/TECHNOLOGY I NEED OR WANT 
IN VEHICLE INTERNET APPLICATIONS ARE NOT USEFUL 
IN VERY PETITE AND LOVE THAT YOU CAN RAISE THE SEATS!!
IN WINTER ICE BUILD UP ON OUTER SIDES OF WINDSHIELD
INABILITY OF FRONT SEAT PASSENGER TO TYPE IN THINGS WHILE VEHICLE IS MOVING THERE IS NO REASON WHY A PASSENGER SHOULD BE PREVENTED FROM USING THE SYSTEM WHILE THE DRIVER IS BUSY DRIVING 
INABILITY TO ADJUST THE SEAT WELL HAVE A BIG BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER S SIDE FOR PEDESTRIANS
INABILITY TO CHANGE SERIUS STATIONS WHILE DRIVING IS UNACCEPTABLE
INABILITY TO LIFT WIPERS WITH HOOD DOWN IS ANNOYING
INACCURATE NAV SYSTEM THE ONLY TIME USED OTHERWISE USING ONSTAR FOR NAVIGATION W/O DIFFICULTY I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RE SYNC MY IPHONE W/ BLUETOOTH IN MY VEHICLE I LOVE IT WHEN IT WORKS!
INACCURATE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT READ TEXT MESSAGING ALTHOUGH IT INDICATES BLUETOOTH DEVICE IS CONNECTED ALWAYS SAYING MESSAGE NO TEXT MESSAGES FOUND CONTROL OF DVD IS FROM REAR REMOTE ONLY WHICH IS TAKES DRIVER OUT OF IT POSITIVE SAFETY 
INADEQUATE SUN VISOR COVERAGE FOR SIDE WINDOW
INAPP SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOOKS A DECADE OLD FROM DESIGN LOOK AND FEEL AND GRAPHICS WAY TOO MANY STEPS TO ENTER ANYTHING PLUS CONFIRM MUSIC SELECTION IS JUST EASIER FROM PHONE THAN TRYING TO USE CAR ALSO TEXT MESSAGE DINGS 
INCLUDE A MUTE BUTTON ON THE STEARING WHEEL CONTROLS POSSIBLY A LARGER GPS/MAP DISPLAY 
INCLUDE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL IN TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE DITTO FOR HEADLIGHTS THAT FOLLOW TURNS 
INCLUDE AUDIO CONTROLS FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
INCLUDE BETTER SPEAKERS BY DEFAULT 
INCLUDE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR MUSIC PLAYING FROM CELL PHONE
INCLUDE CD PLAYER
INCLUDE HD RADIO
INCLUDE MORE MODERN FEATURES AS STANDARD ITEMS NOT EXTRA ADD ONS
INCLUDE NAVIGATION ON ALL MODELS AS I STATED BEFORE MY VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE THE NAVIGATION PACKAGE I WANTED TO USE MY IPHONE5 AND WAS NOT ABLE TO ONCE MY PHONE WAS PAIRED THE CAR DISABLED MY VOICE ON MY PHONE I HAD TO UN PAIR MY IPHONE5 
INCLUDE PROXIMITY WARNING WHEN IN REVERSE ESPECIALLY SINCE MY VEHICLE INCLUDES THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE 
INCLUDE VOICE ACTIVATED TEXT AND AND ENABLE TO READ TEXT MASSAGES
INCLUDE WIFI 
INCLUDING A SINGLE CD PLAYER RATHER THAN A 6 CD CHANGER IS A WASTE 
INCOMING CALLS AND THE NOTIFICATION PROVIDED
INCOMING CALLS ON BLUETOOTH SOUND FUZZY
INCOMING CALLS SOMETIMES VOICE QUALITY NOT CLEAR
INCOMING VOICE QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED THE SOUND IS NOT REAL CLEAR 
INCOMING VOLUME IS REALLY LOW SOMETIMES YOU VE GOT TO CRANK THE VOLUME INTO THE 30S OUT OF A POSSIBLE 40 TO HEAR THE PERSON YOU RE TALKING TO CAR S STEREO SYSTEM IS REALLY NICE IT S TOP END VOLUME ISN T GREAT AS EXPECTED IN MOST FACTORY IN 
INCONTROL APPS IN OTS CURRENT STATE IS USELESS SCREEN TRANSITIONS ARE SLOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE APPS ARE RUNNING ON MY PHONE BUT I HAVE A BRAND NEW GALAXY NOTE 4 THERE SHOULD BE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING THE FEW APPS THAT ARE AVAILABLE CURRENTLY 
INCONTROL APPS NEED WORK NEED BETTER APPS AND AN EASIER CONNECTION PROCESS 
INCORPORATE APPLE CARPLAY INTO THE SYSTEM
INCREASE ACCURACY OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
INCREASE FUEL ECONOMY 
INCREASE OF THE VOLUME OF CALLS ON BLUE TOOTH CONNECTION
INCREASE SPEAKER VOLUME
INCREASE SPECIFIC TOPICS FOR EXAMPLE I WANTED TO GO TO CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AT NORTHRIDGE IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THE SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WANTED TO GO 
INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS AND SCOPE COVERAGE OF HEADLIGHTS 
INCREASE THE FAVORITES LIST OR CATEGORIZE THAT LIST BY SUBJECT 
INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE AREA ON THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR EACH CHANNEL IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL USING THE SCREEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD AND CONCENTRATE ON THE SCREEN THIS IS A DANGEROUS COMBINATION 
INCREASE THE VOICE ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
INCREASED ACCURACY OF VERBAL COMMANDS & MORE CONSISTENT SYNCING OF IPHONE MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH 
INCREASED INSURANCE COST VS SUBARU
INCREASED SPEED IN PROCESSING VOICE COMMANDS 
INCREDIBLE ADJUSTABILITY OF DRIVER S SEAT AND STEERING WHEEL TO ACCOMMODATE PERSON OF ANY SIZE! I FEEL VERY SAFE DRIVING MY NEW VOLVO! THIS CAR ADJUSTS FOR YOU AND YOU DON T HAVE TO ADJUST TO THE CAR 
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MEDIA SELECTIONS AVAILABLE 
INCREDIBLE BRAKES!
INCREDIBLE HORSEPOWER
INCREDIBLE SOUND
INCREDIBLE SOUND OF MUSIC SYSTEM AND PRESENTATION OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
INCREDIBLE SOUND QUALITY 
INCREDIBLE SOUND QUALITY OF THE BANG AND OLUFSEN SYSTEM
INCREDIBLY MANEUVERABLE AND IT STOPS VERY QUICKLY REAR AND QUARTER VISIBILITY IS NATURALLY IMPAIRED BECAUSE IT IS A CONVERTIBLE 
INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL XENON HEADLIGHTS @ NIGHT LANE WARNING SIGNALS ON THE MIRRORS THEY ALREADY SAVED ME FROM A FREEWAY COLLSION THE BRAKING SYSTEM FOR STOPPING THE CAR AT LESS THAN 19 MPH 
INDEPENDENT AND NOT RELYING ON ONSTAR FOR EVERYTHING I DO NOT HAVE ONSTAR THAT S WHY MY NAVIGATION VEHICLE DIAGNOSTICS ETC DON T WORK I HAD A 2013 NISSAN FRONTIER SD CARD NAVIGATION LOVED IT
INDICATOR THAT ANOTHER CAR IS IN THE BLIND SPOT IS A GREAT FEATURE 
INEFFICIENT BRAKING
INFINITE LEFT OUT COLLISION SYSTEM IN THIS YEARS MODELS VERY DISAPPOINTED LEFT OUT I HAD IT IN MY LAST G37S 
INFINITI HAS IMPROVED IN THIS AREA BUT CAN STILL USE FURTHER REFINEMENT VOICE RECOGNITION WHICH HAD BEEN HORRIBLE IS NOT WORKABLE NAVIGATION WHICH HAD BEEN STUBBORN IS NOW MORE USER FRIENDLY BUT COMPARED TO WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN MERCEDES 
INFINITY SOUND SYSTEM
INFINITY SOUND SYSTEM 
INFORMATION AT TOP OF SCREEN TOO SMALL A LARGER FONT WOULD BE NICE SCREEN COULD BE ANGLED TOWARDS DRIVER
INFORMATION DISPLAY
INFORMATION ON HOW TO GET SOME OF THE AVAILABLE APPLICATIONS IS A BIT THIN I M HAVING A CHALLENGE GETTING PANDORA BUT I LL ASSUME ITS BECAUSE I ONLY CARRY A TABLET AND DO NOT HAVE AN I PAD OR CELL PHONE IT S NOT EXPLAINED VERY WELL IN 
INFORMATION ON HOW TO USE CORRECTLY AS IF YOU GIVE THE WRONG ANSWER YOU OFTEN LOOSE THE COMMNICATION AND HAVE TO START OVER
INFORMATION SCREEN COULD HAVE BEEN UPDATED BEFORE 2015 
INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM CONVENIENTLY COMBINES ALL OF THE SYSTEMS IN AN EASY TO USE PACKAGE 
INGRESS/EGRESS
INITIAL QUALITY DEFECTS
INITIAL SYNC FUNCTIONS AND SYNC INSTRUCTIONS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT HOW TO CONNECT AND LOCATE OTHER INSTRUCTION INFORMATION ONLINE
INITIAL USE OF THE U CONNECT SCREEN WAS VERY EASY FOR SOME APPLICATIONS THAT ARE INFREQUENTLY USED I STILL HAVE TO RE TRAIN MYSELF 
INITIALLY BMW DID NOT HAVE A GOOD USER INTERFACE SYSTEM THAT HAS DEFINITELY CHANGED AND IS NOW ONE OF THE MOST INTUITIVE SYSTEMS ON THE MARKET 
INITIALLY I DIDN T WANT THE ADDITIONAL SAFETY PACKAGE I M SO GLAD I GOT IT!!
INITIALLY I FELT NERVOUS ABOUT THE VISIBILITY FRONT SIDES AND REAR WHEN DRIVING IN BUSY PARKING LOTS IT FELT LIKE MY VIEW WAS LIMITED AFTER DRIVING THE TERRAIN FOR 2+ MONTHS NOW I NO LONGER FEEL THAT WAY I THINK IT WAS JUST GETTING USED TO 
INITIALLY MY PHONE DIDN T PLAY LOUD ENOUGH THROUGH THE SOUND SYSTEM AFTER GOING TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP THE PROBLEM WAS REMEDIED 
INITIALLY SLIGHTLY CHALLENGING FIGURING OUT IN PARKING WHERE THE FRONT OF THE KIA IS CAUSE YOU CAN T SEE THE FRONT HOOD AT ALL FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT UNLESS YOU ARE EXTREMELY TALL I HAVE RAISED THE SEAT AND STILL CAN T SEE THE HOOD 
INITIALLY VERY UNHAPPY WITH LACK OF BUILT IN SATELITE RADIO RECEIVER AS WITH PREVIOUS MINI THEN VERY UNHAPPY WITH DIFFICULTY USING PHONE TO ACCESS EITHER INTERNET RADIO OR SUBSCRIBED SIRIUS RADIO PARING AS BEEN DIFFICULT AND SPOTTY AT BEST AND N 
INITIATING BLUETOOTH SERVICE COULD BE COMPLETELY HANDS FREE 
INITIATING CONNECTION TO INTERNET APPLICATIONS IS SLOW USE A CONNECTION FASTER THAN 3G
INOPERABILITY OF WIPER BLADES AND FAILURE TO FIX THEM BY TWO DEALERSHIPS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE 
INPUT INTO NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY CLUNKY SOMETHING OUT OF 1990!! THE POINT AND CLICK LETTER BY LETTER IS MADDENING THE CAR IS EXCEPTIONAL IN ALL REGARS EXCEPT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM INPUT 
INPUT NOT AS USER FRIENDLY AS SONE OTHER MANUFACTURERS
INPUT OF ADDRESS COULD BE EASIER E G PUTTING ZIP CODE FIRST WOULD NARROW DOWN THE STATE
INPUT OF DESTINATION FOR NAG
INPUT OF STATIONS INTO MEMORY NOT EASY ONCE STATIONS ARE SAVED ITS ACTUALLY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE STATIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY MEMORY SPOTS ITS HARD TO LOCATED STATIONS YOU HAVE STORAGE FOR AM FM AND SATELITE AND ITS HARDS TO GET FROM ON 
INPUT OF THE ADDRESS WHEN NOT USING VOICE ACTIVATION SHOULD BE EASIER THAN THE DIAL SYSTEM FOR NAVIGATING FROM LETTER TO LETTER
INPUTING THE DESTINATION CITY AND ADDRESS PREDICTION IS NEEDED 
INPUTTING A DESTINATION WHILE DRIVING NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED GARMIN DOES IT FAR BETTER UPDATES TO NAVIGATION MAPS AND POI S SHOULD BE INCLUDED FOR THE FIRST TWO TO THREE YEARS OF OWNERSHIP 
INPUTTING ADDRESSES INTO THE NAV SHOULD BE EASIER TO DO 
INPUTTING DESTINATION INTO NAV DOES NOT FOLLOW NORMAL LOGIC IT SHOULD REMEMBER THE COUNTRY AND STATE I M LOCATED IN AND NOT MAKE ME INPUT THIS INFO EVERY TIME 
INPUTTING DESTINATIONS
INPUTTING INFORMATION IN NAV AND ENTERTAIN SYSTEM BY DIAL SELECTION
INPUTTING NAV VIA TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE FABULOUS
INPUTTING THE ADDRESS TAKES TOO LONG ALSO SEARCHING FOR MUSIC AND SWITCHING SONGS TAKES TOO LONG AS WELL IT S CUMBERSOME 
INPUTTING WHERE YOU ARE GOING ON THE NAVIGATION IS QUITE A SLOW PROCESS 
INSIDE DOOR POCKETS LOOK CHEAP
INSIDE IS TOO TIGHT NO LEG ROOM BACK SEST RIDING IS TOO UNCOMFORTABLE
INSIDE LIGHTING
INSIDE MIRROR LOCATION IS THE REASON THAT FORWARD VISIBILITY IS ONLY A 3 
INSIDE REAR MIRROR COULD HAVE MADE WIDER
INSIDE REAR MIRROR VISIBILITY
INSIDE REARVIEW MIRROR CONFIGURATION IS VERY INTRUSIVE 
INSIDE ROOF IS KIND OF NARROW AND LOW COULD USE MORE HEIGHT 
INSIDE SUN VISORS ON MY OLD OUTBACK HAD EXTENSIONS THAT PULLED OUT I MISS THEM
INSPIRING CONFIDENCE SAYS IT ALL
INSTABILITY IN WINDY CONDITIONS
INSTALL A BETTER QUALITY AUDIO AND SPEAKER SYSTEM
INSTALL A MOUSE SYSTEM LIKE THE LEXUS RX 350 HAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SMALL AND CAN T EASILY REACH THE SCREEN TO TOUCH IT PLUS WHEN YOU TRY TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT OR DO SOMETHING AND HIT A BUMP YOUR FINGER TOUCHES THE WRONG AREA 
INSTALL NAME BRAND EQUIPMENT
INSTALLING AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS WOULD BE A DEFINITE PLUS FOR THIS VEHICLE 
INSTANT AND RELIABLE BLUETOOTH SYNCING WITH PHONE
INSTANT BUTTON CONTROLS FOR AM/FM
INSTANT INFO ABOUT CAR S PERFORMANCE FUEL CONSUMPTION INSTANT CONSUMPTION ETC
INSTANT RESPONSE TO VOICE COMMAND
INSTANTANEOUS ELECTRIC POWER TO THE WHEELS WITH PERFECT TRACTION CONTROL GIVES SUPERB CONTROL IN DIFFICULT TRAFFIC COMBINED WITH THE FORWARD RADAR MAKES IT THE SAFEST FEELING CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN 
INSTEAD OF A LIST OF RESTAURANTS I WOULD LIKE TO TYPE IN THE NAME
INSTEAD OF CAMERA FOR BACKING UP I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE CAMERA ON FOR WHEN CHANGING LANES FOR ADDED SECURITY 
INSTEAD OF COPYING EVERYONE ELSE S MEDIA DISPLAYS AND THEIR LOOKS BE ORIGINAL MITSUBISHI I DON T OWN 5 MITSUBISHI S FOR A REASON OF COPY CATTING OTHER MANUFACTURERS
INSTEAD OF HAVING CHAIN COMMANDS COULD DO WITH JUST SINGLE WORD COMMANDS 
INSTEAD OF HAVING THE CHEVY EMBLEM TURNING AROUND WHEN THE SYSTEM IS TURNED ON SHOULD HAVE THE SS EMBLEM COME UP WITH ADDITIONAL GRAPHICS 
INSTEAD OF VW SPECIFIC INPUT CABLE USE STANDARD USB INPUT 
INSTITUTE HIWAY SAFETY RATING
INSTRUCTION BOOK HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO OPERATE SYSTEM
INSTRUCTION BOOKLET WITH PICTURES & INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW DO I DO THIS? 
INSTRUCTION IN THE BOOK COULD BE A LITTLE CLEARER
INSTRUCTION MANUAL SHOULD BE MORE DETAILED AND CLEARER AND IT SHOULD INCLUDE ILLUSTRATIONS 
INSTRUCTION TOO COMPLICATED FOR AVERAGE ELDERLY DRIVER 
INSTRUCTIONS ARE COMPLICATED AND REQUIRE JUMPING FORM PAGE TO PAGE 
INSTRUCTIONS ARE VERY CONFUSING 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR NAVIGATION RADIO AND HANDS FREE PHONES ARE REAL DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHICH IT MAKES UNSAFE TO USE THE VOICE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU SAY 
INSTRUCTIONS FROM DEALER AS TO HOW TO USE 
INSTRUCTIONS FROM DEALER ON HOW TO USE VOICE COMMANDS ON THE VARIOUS PRODUCTS IN THE CAR S SYSTEM 
INSTRUCTIONS I MOSTLY BOUGHT THIS NEW CAR INSTEAD OF A USED ONE B/C I THOUGHT I COULD USE IT TO SEND AND READ TEXTS EVEN AFTER STUDYING THE AVAILABLE MANUALS I DON T KNOW IF I CAN OR IF I HAVE TO BUY A CERTAIN CABLE TO DO SO THE DEALER COUL 
INSTRUCTIONS LEAVE A LITTLE TO BE DESIRED MAYBE HAVE AN ON LINE VIDEO OLDER PEOPLE AREN T AS QUICK TO PICK UP THESE NEW CONCEPTS REMEMBER THEY ARE THE ONES THAT CAN AFFORD AND OWN THESE CORVETTES 
INSTRUCTIONS NEED IMPROVEMENT AND USEFUL OF NAV SYSTEM
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE
INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE ALL THIS 
INSTRUCTIONS ON USE OF VOICE ACTIVATED SERVICES 
INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING USE OF VOICE RECOGNITION ARE UNCLEAR RESULTING IN NON USE AT LEAST UNTIL I HAVE MORE TIME TO STUDY THEM 
INSTRUCTIONS TOO LONG
INSTRUCTIONS TUTORIAL? ON HOW TO USE SYSTEMS THE SALES PERSON REALLY DID A POOR JOB EXPLAINING THE FEATURES I ASKED THE SERVICE DEPT BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE ANYONE WHO KNEW HOW TO USE THEM EITHER!!!!
INSTRUCTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THE OWNER S MANUAL IS USELESS! I THINK THE VEHICLE SHOULD BE RANKED MUCH HIGHER THAN THE MARKS I HAVE GIVEN IT BUT IT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS MY ABILITY TO USE IT I AM NOT STUPID BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND ANYTH 
INSTRUMENT PANEL AND GAUGES A BIT SMALL HIDDEN BEHIND STEERING WHEEL 
INSTRUMENT PANEL ILLUMINATION
INSTRUMENT PANEL REQUIRES MOVING THE HEAD TO SEE SOME GADGETS CAN IMPROVE BUTTONS CAN BE PLACED DIFFERENTLY ON THE MID CONSUL PANEL FOR A BETTER/EASIER REACH
INSTRUMENT PANEL VISABILITY IS VERY GOOD WITH DIGITAL SPEEDOMETER DISPLAY BUT RADIO DISPLAY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO READ WHILE DRIVING SUNVISORS WHEN POSITIONED OVER SIDE WINDOW DO NOT EXTEND REARWARD ENOUGH
INSTRUMENT PANEL/SCREEN
INSTRUMENTATION PANEL A BIT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE
INSULATION AND SOUND DEADENING
INTEGRATE GARMAN SERVICES FOR NAVIGATION
INTEGRATE TRAFFIC FROM OTA RADIO AND NOT USE XM XM WARNINGS ARE ANNOYING AND WORTHLESS BY NOT PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION 
INTEGRATE TRAFFIC INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IS VASTLY INFERIOR TO GOOGLE MAPS ON A SMART PHONE IN ESTIMATING TRAFFIC AND PREDICTING DESTINATION TIME 
INTEGRATE WITH GOOGLE ANDROID AUTO THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT 
INTEGRATED HANDS FREE PHONE 
INTEGRATED SATELLITE RADIO
INTEGRATED SPOTTER MIRRORS ON EXTERIOR MIRRORS TO REDUCE BLINDSPOTS WOULD BE GREAT 
INTEGRATED SYSTEMS
INTEGRATES VERY WELL WITH MY PHONE VIA THE USB 
INTEGRATION
INTEGRATION OF ALL THE FEATURES THROUGH ONE CONSOLE 
INTEGRATION OF SYSTEMS KEEPS THE INTERIOR LOOKING NICE SMOOTH AND CLEAN VERY EASY TO LEARN TO USE 
INTEGRATION WITH APPLE CARPLAY DO AWAY WITH BUILT IN NAVIGATION AND USE CARPLAY INSTEAD SO WE CAN JUST DRIVE EVERYTHING FROM THE PHONE CHARGING FOR MAP UPDATES IS A COMPLETE RIP OFF
INTEGRATION WITH CAR AND EXTERNAL DEVICES
INTEGRATION WITH GOOGLE MAPS FROM SMARTPHONE AND ABILITY TO SEND A DESTINATION FROM MY PHONE TO THE THE VEHICLE NAV SYSTEM BY BLUETOOTH OR SOME OTHER SIMPLE METHOD

INTERACTIVE AND ALL INCLUSIVE
INTERACTS VERY QUICKLY
INTERCONNECTION AND USABILITY VERY POOR WITH IPHONE ON USB FOR MUSIC PLAYBACK NAVIGATION/BROWSE FOR SPOTIFY IS NONEXISTENT!!!! ONLY ITUNES RECOGNIZED VOICE RECOGNITION POOR APPEARS TECHNOLOGY SEVERAL GENERATIONS OLD THE EMBEDDED UI NAVIGATION 
INTERFACE BETWEEN SMARTPHONE NAVIGATION AND BLUETOOTH AUDIO IS LESS THAN IDEAL SOMETIMES IT WORKS AND SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT 
INTERFACE COULD BE A PRETTIER MORE UP TO DATE UI IT LOOKS OLD 
INTERFACE COULD BE MORE CONVENIENT 
INTERFACE DO NOT MAKE IT LIKE APPLE DO NOT MERGE SAVED POINTS OF INTERESTS SAVED LOCATIONS AND PHONE NUMBERS TOO HARD TO LOCATE A CONTACT 
INTERFACE IS AWKWARD NO WAY TO UPDATE OR MODIFY DISPLAY/INTERFACE TO CUSTOMIZE AND ENHANCE INTER OPERABILITY 
INTERFACE IS HARD TO NAVIGATE BY TOUCH ALONE THE BUTTONS TO THE SIDES OF THE CONTROL KNOB ARE ALL FLAT AND NOT EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE BY TOUCH ALONE 
INTERFACE IS NOT USER FRIENDLY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND GO FROM SCREEN TO SCREEN 
INTERFACE IS WELL DESIGNED SO THAT I DON T NEED AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL TO OPERATE IT 
INTERFACE NEEDS TO BE CLEANED UP HANDS FREE MICROPHONE IS INTERMITTENT 
INTERFACE NOT AS USER FRIENDLY AS I WOULD LIKE
INTERFACE PERFORMANCE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED 
INTERFACE SEEMS RATHER ANTIQUATED ALSO IF YOU HAVE TWO BLUETOOTH ENABLED PHONES IN THE CAR THE SYSTEM GETS CONFUSED 
INTERFACE TO MORE APPS THAN PANDORA
INTERFACE WITH BUTTONS ON THE SIDE IS A LITTLE CLUNKY 
INTERFACE WITH IPHONE
INTERFACE WITH THIRD PARTY SMARTPHONE PROVIDERS EASE OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO SYSTEM

INTERNAL HARD DRIVE
INTERNAL HARD DRIVE IS GREAT AND ALLOWS ME TO ALWAYS HAVE MY MUSIC AT HAND
INTERNAL LIGHTING
INTERNET
INTERNET ACCESS IN THE CAR IS GREAT ALLOWS KIDS TO USE THE IPAD IN THE BACK SEAT 
INTERNET AND APPLICATION CONNECTIVITY VERY SLOW 
INTERNET APPLICATION FEATURE IS VERY SLOW TO START UP AND WILL LOSE CONNECTION PERIODICALLY ALSO IT ONLY HAS 3G 
INTERNET APPS ARE TOO HARD TO USE 
INTERNET CONNECTION
INTERNET CONNECTION AND TEXTING
INTERNET CONNECTION AS IT ALLOWS PASSENGERS TO USE DEVICES WITHOUT NEEDING TO CONNECT TO A CELL CARRIER 
INTERNET CONNECTION MAKES EVERY THING SO EASY
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY MEANS I ONLY HAVE TO SAY ONLINE <DESTINATION> AND GOOGLE MAPS WILL FIND LOCATION AND ROUTE 
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY OFTEN DOES NOT WORK
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY RUNNING DVD PLAYER THROUGH SYSTEM
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY TAKES A LONG TIME IT ALSO DROPS THE CONNECTION 
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY VIA BLUETOOTH
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY WAS ANNOUNCED A MONTH AFTER GETTING THIS VEHICLE WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE
INTERNET DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE PHONE IS ON I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT SOME FEATURES YET 
INTERNET GPS ETC SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN BASE MODEL 
INTERNET IS SPOTTY I LISTENT TO PANDORA THE MOST AND IT JUST CUTS OUT AND PAUSES DAILY
INTERNET NEVER WORKS
INTERNET OPTIONS ARE QUITE COMPLICATED NO TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE 
INTERNET RADIO NEEDS HAVES BUGS WORKED OUT!
INTERNET RADIO ROCKS!
INTERNET RADIOS APPS TEXT MESSAGING AVAILABILITY
INTERNET WEB ACCESS IS TOO ANTIQUATED TO USE LABORIOUS SINGLE LETTER INPUT 
INTERRUPTED VISIBILTY WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN BECAUSE OF VERTICAL WINDOW SUPPORT PLACEMENT 
INTOUCH NEEDS A COMPLETE OVERHAUL AND SHOULD BE RETHOUGHT REDESIGNED REINTEGRATED AND REEXECUTED AS IS IT S A DISASTER AND AN EMBARRASSMENT 
INTRODUCE THE TESLA TOUCH SYSTEM!!!
INTUITIVE AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND
INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE 
INTUITIVE AND ONLY REQUIRES MILLISECONDS OF DISTRACTION FROM DRIVING
INTUITIVE CONTROLS !!!! SEE GARMIN IPHONE ETC 
INTUITIVE CONTROLS EASE OF LEARNING HOW TO USE ALL FEATURES BY JUST PLAYING WITH THE CONTROLS AND WITHOUT NEED TO REFERENCE MANUAL I LOOKED AT OTHER MODELS FOR OVER A YEAR BEFORE MAKING DECISION ON MURANO AND DRIVEN RENTAL CARS AND NOTHING COMP

INTUITIVE NAVIGATION OF CONTROLS 
INTUITIVE USE 
INTUITIVENESS OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM
INTUITIVR CONTROLS
IPAD CONNECTOR WOULD BE NICE
IPHONE 5S DOESN T WORK BY USB

IPHONE INTEGRATION AND MESSAGE READING/COMPOSITION I HAVE A HOUR COMMUTE EACH WAY TO WORK AND I RECEIVE SEVERAL MESSAGES IT S GREAT THAT THE CAR WILL READ THEM TO ME AND I DON T HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD I CAN THEN RESPOND VIA VOICE 
IPHONE INTEGRATION BLUETOOTH HANDSFREE WORKS REALLY WELL
IPHONE INTEGRATION IS REALLY SAD FOR A LUXURY BRAND NOTE THIS IS MY WEEKEND CAR VERY LOW USEAGE SO I HAVE THE BASE SYSTEM BUT EVEN FOR BASE ON A BENZ IT SHOULD BE BETTER THAN A MID MARKET ASIAN CAR THAT I TYPICALLY RENT FROM HERTZ
IPHONE INTERGRATION
IPHONE PLAT THROUGH SPEAKER WHEN CONNECTED
IPHONE PODCAST CONTROL APP INTEGRATION COULD BE BETTER
IPHONE/IPOD BLUETOOTH INTERACTION IS LOUSY 
IPOD
IPOD / PANDORA INTERFACE
IPOD BLUETOOTH CONNECTION AND SOUND QUALITY HANDS FREE CELL PHONE CAPABILITY 
IPOD COMPATIBILITY
IPOD CONNECTION
IPOD CONNECTION DOES NOT ALLOW MUSIC TO BE PLAYED ONLY ALLOWS A CHARGE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO NOT BE ABLE TO USE A FEATURE ON A BRAND NEW VEHICLE 
IPOD CONNECTION IS SENSITIVE DURING COLD TEMPERATURES AND FAILS ROUTINELY 
IPOD CONNECTION IS SOMETIMES ERRATIC NOT SURE IF IT IS MY IPOD OR THE CAR
IPOD CONNECTION IS USELESS I HAVE IPHONE AND IT DOES NOT WORK EVER
IPOD CONNECTIVITY AND INTEGRATION TO CONTROLS ALONG WITH SOUND QUALITY
IPOD CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE 
IPOD CONTROLS COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE 
IPOD DOCK
IPOD DOES NOT DISPLAY ARTWORK AND THERE SHOULD BE BETTER WAY TO ACCESS LARGE BUBER OF SONGS ARTISTS PLAYLIST VIA A ALPHABETIC TAB INSTEAD OF HAVING TO TURN THE SCROLL KNOB FOREVER WHEN GOING FROM A A IN A LARGE COLLECTION OF MUSIC 
IPOD EASE OF USE AND CONTROL ON SCREEN DON T CARE ABOUT APPS 
IPOD GOES INTO LOCK MODE AND WE HAVE TO UNPLUG IT TO RESTART IT KIND OF ANNOYING 
IPOD HOOK UP IS IN AN IMPOSSIBLE PLACE THE AUDIO/RADIO SYSTEM IS IMPOSSIBLE TO QUICKLY ADJUST TOO MANY STEPS
IPOD INTEGRATION AND OVERALL FLEXIBILITY IS GOOD I PURCHASED A VEHICLE BECAUSE I WANTED RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION NOT A MOBILE INTERNET CAFE THERE ARE TOO MANY DISTRACTED OR IMPAIRED DRIVERS ON THE ROAD ALREADY!
IPOD INTEGRATION IS EXCELLENT
IPOD INTEGRATION IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE 
IPOD INTERFACE IN GLOVE COMPARMENT IPOD SLOW TO RESPOND
IPOD INTERFACE IS ANNOYING BECAUSE IT RESETS THE IPOD AT EVERY START UP IDEALLY IT SHOULD GO BACK TO THE SONGS THAT WERE PLAYING THE LAST TIME DRIVEN 
IPOD INTERFACE/CONTROL FOR BOTH ON SCREEN AND STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS AND VOICE COMMANDS!!!!!!!!!!!
IPOD IS SOMETIMES UNPLAYABLE 
IPOD MUSIC TENDS O FREEZE SOMETIMES VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR AND BLUETOOTH MUSIC CONNECTIVITY CAN BE POOR SOMETIMES
IPOD NAVIGATION IS SOMEWHAT CLUNKY IF POSSIBLE A TOUCH SCREEN WITH DRAG TO SCROLL FEATURE WOULD MAKE NAVIGATING MUSIC AND ARTISTS EASIER AS IT STANDS THE SCREEN CAN ONLY SUPPORT A FEW ARTISTS AT ONE TIME AND IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME AND CONCENTR 
IPOD PANDORA CONNECTIVITY
IPOD PLAYBACK THROUGH SENSUS IS SLOW AND APPEARS TO REBOOT WHEN YOU TURN ON THE CAR 
IPOD/SMART PHONE MUSIC CONNECTION
IRREGULAR WIPER COVERAGE
IS FUN AT THE FIRST MONTH TO HAVE A SUBARU IMPREZA AS MY FIRST AS TIME GOES BY I USE LESS THE TOUCH SCREEN WHEN I DRIVE ALONE OR ON LONG RIDE WHEN I AM WITH PEOPLE OR FRIENDS I WOULD USE IT TO SHOW IT UP BUT I USE IT WHEN I NEED TO ENTERTAIN MY 
IS FUN TO DRIVE
IS HARD TO SEE AROUND AND TO THE BACK
IS IT POSSIBLE TO COMBINE TWO SCREEN INTO ONE? I DON T IT IS NECESSARY TO PLACE TWO SCREENS THERE 
IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A VISOR THAT EXTENDS BEHIND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR? THERE ARE FREQUENT OCCASIONS WHEN THE SUN SHINES BETWEEN THE 2 FRONT VISORS 
IS NEED A SCREEN MORE BIG AND CONTROLS DIGITALS
IS NOT ALL WHEEL DRIVE
IS SOMETIMES MUFFLED
IS SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED TO OPERATE
IS THERE ANY SMART WAY TO BLOCK THE SUN FROM DRIVER SIDE WINDOW?
IS UP TO DATE
IS VERY NICE

ISSUE WITH IPHONE CONNECTION THRU IN CAR SPEAKER SYSTEM PEOPLE CANNOT HEAR ME SPEAK VERY WELL/ VOICE BREAKS UP INTERMITTENTLY 
ISSUES GETTING PHONE TO CONNECT FOR CALLS IPHONE 6
ISSUES MENTIONED
ISSUES WITH MEMORY CARD
ISSUES WITH USB CONNECTION WITH IPHONE 6
ISTALL USB PORTS TO CONNECT TO USE AND CHARGE PHONE 
IT ACTS AS IF MY CELL PHONE BECOMES PART OF THE VEHICLE GREAT INTEGRATION WITH TECHNOLOGY 
IT ADDS TO THE OVERALL DRIVING EXPERIENCE AND ASSISTS IN BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE TO OTHERS WITHOUT SERIOUSLY ENCUMBERING THE DRIVER FROM BEING DISTRACTED WHILE DRIVING ALSO GIVES PASSENGERS THE ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE IN CAR COMMUNICATION EXPER 
IT ALL WORKS GOOD AND IS FAIRLY EASY TO USE 
IT ALL WORKS WITH EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY 
IT ALLOWS YOU TO PROGRAM YOUR FAVORITE PHONE NUMBERS AND KEEP THEM VISIBLE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN AT ALL TIMES IF YOU PREFER 
IT ALWAYS MISINTERPRET WHAT WE SAY 
IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO ME THAT IN VEHICLE AUDIO AND NAVIGATION FUNCTIONALITY LAGS SEVERAL YEARS BEHIND WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON SMART PHONES AND TABLETS AS SOMEONE WHO IS EXTREMELY WELL VERSED IN THE USE OF THESE OTHER DEVICES I FIND THE RELATIVELY OLD 
IT ALWAYS WORKS IS CONSISTENT WHEN USING IT INTUITIVE USER INTERFACE 
IT APPEARS AS IF THIS VEHICLE HAS A LARGER BLIND SPOT AREA THE BLIND SPOT DETECTORS DO HELP WITH THIS MOST OF THE TIME HOWEVER SOMETIMES EVEN THE SENSORS DO NOT CATCH OTHER VEHICLES WITHIN THE AREA WHICH COULD CREATE A PROBLEM WITH SOMEONE IF T 
IT APPEARS TO HAVE SOME BLIND SPOTS 
IT AS HAND FREE ACCIDENT PREVENTATIVE!
IT AT TIMES IT TAKES YOU OUT OF THE WAY OF YOUR DESTINATION SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO TAKE YOU THE QUICKEST WAY I HAVE NOT NOTICED IF IT TELLS YOU THERE IS TRAFFIC OR AN ACCIDENT AHEAD AND RE ROUTES YOU THAT WOULD BE A GREAT FEATURE TO HAVE 
IT AUTOMATICALLY LINKS TO MY CELL PHONE WHENEVER I ENTER VEHICLE AND I CAN EASILY USE HANDS FREE CALLING 
IT AUTOMATICALLY PICKS UP MY IPHONE MUSIC WHEN I SELECT MEDIA WOW!
IT BE MORE CONVENIENT TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST THE VOLUME OF THE VOICE GUIDANCE SYSTEM ALSO THE CARGO NET IN THE BACK INTERFERES WITH THE QUALITY OF SOUND THAT THE SUBWOOFER PRODUCES MAKES RATTLING NOISE 
IT BUMPS 
IT CAN ALL BE DONE WITHOUT TAKING MY EYES OFF THE ROAD I HAVE HAD OTHER VEHICLES WITH NAV SYSTEMS AND THEY ARE ALL CONFUSING AND WERE RARELY USED BUT WITH MY SUBARU IT IS SIMPLE AND INTUITIVE 
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES IN BLIND SPOT EVEN WHEN TURNING TO LOOK 
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE SIDE BACK WINDOWS WHEN CHANGING LANES 
IT CAN BE DISTRACTING CHOOSING RADIO STATIONS WHILE DRIVING
IT CAN BE DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING
IT CAN BE HARD TO JUDGE WHERE THE NOST OF THE VEHICLE IS WHEN PULLING INTO A PARKING SPOT 
IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE IN THE BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDES OF THE CAR
IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN DRIVING 
IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE THE LEFT REAR SIDE WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE 
IT CAN CONNECT TO INTERNET THROUGH MY IPHONE WHICH IS GOOD I DO NOT NEED ANY OTHER AUDIO SOURCE ANY MORE 
IT CAN DO ALMOST EVERYTHING
IT CAN HANDLE LARGE 2TB DISKS WITH MEDIA WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR US SINCE WE HAVE TONS OF MUSIC AND LIKE THE WIDE SELECTION GOING TO A DISK INTERFACE BETTER THAN FAT32 WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT 
IT CAN RECOGNIZE MY VOICE COMMANDS BETTER THAN ANYTHING I PREVIOUSLY HAVE OWNED
IT CAN SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE HARD TO SEE BEHIND ME WHEN REVERSING BUT I WAS USED TO DRIVING A TRUCK BEFORE THIS VEHICLE AND I ALSO HAVE A HIGH PROFILE SPOILER ON THIS VEHICLE SO THAT AFFECTS THE REAR VISIBILITY 
IT CAN T SEEM TO SEND TEXT OR READ TEXT MESSAGES FROM CONTACTS IN MY PHONE USING VOICE RECOGNITION 
IT CANNOT RECOGNIZE MY VOICE COMMAND 
IT CONECT ME VERY FAST AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE SO EASY TO FOLLOW JUST MY CAR DOESENT HAVE A FULL SCREEN TO SE THE INSTRUCCTIONS
IT CONNECT TO MY IPHONE REALLY WELL NO FUSS
IT CONSTANTLY GIVES WRONG NAMES AND NUMBERS ENTERED FOR CALLING AND WHEN ENTERING AN ADDRESS
IT COSTS $1 100 TO GET NAVIGATION IN THIS CAR 
IT COULD BE A LITTLE SIMPLER 
IT COULD BE A LOT EASIER TO USE
IT COULD BE BETTER AT RECOGNIZING CONTACTS IF I ASK TO CALL HOME I DON T LIKE TO HAVE TO SELECT FROM MULTIPLE OPTIONS OF THINGS LIKE OWEN THAT MIGHT SOUND LIKE THE WORD HOME 
IT COULD BE CLEARER
IT COULD BE EASIER TO CONTROL A PHONE ON THE BASIC SYNC MODEL THE MY FORD TOUCH MODEL IS MUCH EASIER BUT WAS NOT OFFERED ON THE MODEL TRUCK I WANTED BASED ON OTHER MUST HAVE ITEMS 
IT COULD BE EASIER TO USE 
IT COULD BE EASIER TO USE THE NAMES OF THE ARTIST AND THE TITLE OF THE SONG SHOULD BOTH BE DISPLAYED E G SATELLITE CD OR WHATEVER 
IT COULD BE EASIER TO USE VOICE COMMAND TO FIND A LOCATION
IT COULD BE MADE LESS COMPLICATED I HAVE NOT MANAGED TO USE THE ENTUNE SERVICE THE BLUETOOTH PHONE IS OK THOUGH INCONSISTENT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY MUCH INFERIOR TO THE ONE ON MY PHONE AND ALTHOUGH ITS VISIBILITY IS IN THEORY BETTER 
IT COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE
IT COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE AND UNDERSTAND MY COMMANDS IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER THE EXACT DICTATION FOR EACH COMMAND WHEN YOU NEED IT 
IT COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE SOME OF THE CONTROLS REQUIRE MULTIPLE STEPS TO GET TO WHAT YOU RE LOOKING FOR EX NAVIGATION HAVING BASIC COMMANDS FOR DIFFERENT USES ALL ON ONE DASHBOARD WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND VOICE CONTROLS AREN T GR 
IT COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY 
IT COULD BE SIMPLER TO SET UP AND USE 
IT COULD BE THE POINTED SHAPE OF SIDE MIRRORS THAT IS CAUSING THE VISABILITY PROBLEM I ALSO HAVE A JUDGMENT ISSUE WHEN PULLING OVER TO A CURB I THINK I AM RIGHT NEAR THE CURB AND I CAN BE 2 FEET AWAY I AM ONLY 4 11 BUT I DID HAVE A VW RABBIT 
IT COULD COME STANDARD WITH BLUETOOTH BUT MINE DOES NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH 
IT COULD EITHER HAVE A CD PLAYER OR HARD DRIVE FOR RECORDING
IT COULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED IF CADILLAC NEVER BUILT THIS ESCALADE JUST TO MAKE ANOTHER MODEL 2015 S WHICH IS BETTER IN EVERYWAY OFFERS WIFI ETC
IT COULD HAVE BETTER USE OF IPHONE FEATURES LIKE MAPS ETC AND BETTER VOICE CONTROLS OF AUDIO CONTENT SMART PHONES ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN THE ON BOARD STUFF IN THE XTERRA I WISH I COULD PORT THEM TO THE TOUCH SCREEN ALSO I WISH DESIGNERS 
IT COULD HAVE COME WITH THE YEAR FREE SATELGHT SERVICE THAT WAS LISTED IN MY OWNERS MANUEL OR BEATS BY DRE SOUND SYSTEM
IT COULD HAVE MORE APPS
IT COULD JUST BE BECAUSE MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE I HAD OWNED DIDN T HAVE ANY SPECIAL FEATURES BUT I LOVE THAT I CAN TALK ON THE PHONE WHILE LISTENING THROUGH THE CAR S SPEAKER SYSTEM AND THE PERSON AT THE OTHER END IS ABLE TO HEAR ME CLEARLY I ALSO 
IT COULD PRACTICALLY DRIVE ITSELF I AM STILL DISCOVERING SAFETY FEATURES IN MY CAR 
IT COULD QUIT ASKING ALL THE QUESTIONS WHEN YOU TRY TO MAKE A CALL YOU SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO HIT THE CALL BUTTON AND SAY A NAME OR NUMBER AND CALL BUT WHO KNOWS MAYBE I HAVE THAT AVAILABLE AND DONT EVEN KNOW IT 
IT COULD RECOGNIZE WHAT I SAY BETTER SO THAT EVERY TIME I TRY TO MAKE A CALL IT ISN T A TWO STEP PROCESS 
IT COULD USE A BACK UP CAMERA BECAUSE BACKING UP IS A CHALLENGE IN A CAMARO 
IT COULD USE BLINDSIDE MIRRORS IN THE MIRROR
IT COULD USE MORE BASS I VE ADJUSTED THE BASS & TREBLE BUT FEEL THE SOUND STILL ISN T RICH ENOUGH
IT COULD USE STRONGER WARNING THAN JUST THE MIRROR LIGHTS WHEN YOU START TO CHANGE LANES WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE IN THE BLIND SPOT MAYBE IF YOU START TO GET CLOSER TO SOMEONE IN THE BLIND SPOT YOU GET AN AUDIBLE WARNING BEFORE THE SOUND OF THE CRASH 
IT COULD USE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM THE REARVIEW CAMERA AND BACKUP WARNING IS NICE
IT COULDN T UNDERSTAND THE ADDRESS I WAS GIVING YET IT DOESN T HAVE TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING ME WHEN I GIVE A PHONE NAME OR NUMBER 
IT CUTS OUT SOMETIMES WHEN I GO INTO PARKING GARAGES WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SOUND CONSISTENT 
IT D BE A 10 EXCEPT FOR THE CUE SYSTEM 
IT D BE GREAT IF IT HAD THE ABILITY TO SEND A DICTATED TEXT MESSAGE RATHER THAN HAVING TO SELECT FROM 20 PRESET MESSAGES WHICH ARE MOST OFTEN USELESS 
IT D BE MUCH MORE CONVENIENT IF THE CAR CAME WITH A USB PORT INSTEAD OF AN MDI ONE 
IT D BE NICE IF THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY COULD BE CUSTOMIZED BY THE USER IT S ALSO RATHER FRUSTRATING THAT EVEN THOUGH THE APPLE IPHONE IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR CELLPHONES MY FORD ESCAPE DOESN T SUPPORT THE VIEWING/READING OF TEXT MESSAGES FR 
IT D BE NICE TO HAVE A QUALITY FABRIC FOR THE SUNVISORS SEEMS SOMEWHAT CHINTZY FABRIC RATHER THAN TO HAVE THE FRONT HEADLIGHTS CONSTANTLY ON WHILE VEHICLE IS IN OPERATION IT D BE NICE TO HAVE AN OPTION OF HAVING PARKING LIGHTS ON SEEMS AS TH

IT IS A SMALL CAR AND I CANNOT EXPECT IT TO BE AS SAFE AS A LARGER VEHICLE 
IT IS A SMALL CAR THAT WOULD BE CRUSHED IN A HEARTBEAT BY AN SUV SO FEELING OF SAFETY IS ALL RELATIVE I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS 
IT IS A VERY BASIC SYSTEM THERE IS ON STAR IN THE CAR BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE A SIMPLE BLUE TOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR MY CELL PHONE RATHER THAN ONSTARS EXPENSIVE PHONE SERVICE TAKE OUT ON STAR AND INSTALL A BETTER AUDO SYSTEM WITH BLUE TOOTH

IT IS A VERY GOOD SYSTEM
IT IS A VERY NICE AUDIO SYSTEM

IT IS ALL HANDS FREE
IT IS ALL ON THE NAV SCREEN WHICH CAN BE HARD TO SEE UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE EVERYTHING IS

IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO USE THE SUN VISORS IN CARS WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE THAT IS 5FT 7IN AND SOMEONE THAT IS 6FT 3IN DRIVING THERE ARE TIMES THAT THE VISOR IS GOOD FOR ONE AND BAD FOR ANOTHER THEY NEED TO MAKE THE VISORS MORE ADJUSTABLE

IT TAKES A MINUTE FOR MY DEVICES TO CONNECT TO MY CAR THROUGH BLUETOOTH 
IT TAKES A WHILE FOR THE DVD TO LOAD AND FOR IT TO START PLAYING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SOMEWHAT SLOW TO FIND THE ADDRESS THAT YOU ENTERED IT IS DIFFICULT TO CHANGE THE ROUTE FROM THE ONE THAT THE SYSTEM PICKED

IT TELLS ME I AM IN OKLAHOMA DON T KNOW HOW TO CHANGE MY HOME ADDRESS OR LOCATION I AM IN 
IT TELLS WHEN NOT TO WASTE YOUR TIME WITH A DETOUR IF IT WON T SAVE YOU MUCH TIME 
IT TOOK A BIT TO GET USED TO BUT LIKING THE DUAL VISION SIDE MIRRORS AND LOVING THE BACK UP CAMERA

IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAIR MY PHONE TO THE BLUETOOTH 
IT TOOK SO LONG TO CONNECT THE FIRST TIME I GAVE UP USING THE BUILT IN INTERNET FOR INTERNET RADIO ETC
IT TOOK SOME GETTING USED TO WHEN VIEWING OUT OF MY SIDE WINDOWS AND I AM 6 FEET TALL THEY ARE EXTREMELY TOO SMALL I WISH THAT I WOULD HAVE ADDED THE LANE CHANGE LIGHT OPTION TO HELP ME WHEN CHANGING LANES 
IT TRIES TO BE A BIT TOO FUTURISTIC SIMPLER WOULD BE BETTER EASIER TO NAVIGATE MORE INTERACTIVE MORE INTUITIVE
IT USER FRIENDLY AND MORE DETAILED
IT USUALLY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE MY VOICE WHEN GIVING IT COMMANDS 
IT VERY NICE VECHICLE IT A JOY TO DRIVE
IT WAS A POOR DECISION NOT TO INCLUDE FRONT PROXIMITY DETECTORS BEEPERS ON A $50K CAR REAR IS ALSO MISSING BUT HAS THE REAR VIDEO REAR VIDEO CAMERA IS CHEAP SAVING A COUPLE BUCKS WAS A POOR DECISION 
IT WAS A SOLID AND FUN CAR TO DRIVE WAS VERY ECONOMICAL I JUST SHOULD HAVE SPENT MORE TIME CHOOSING IT WAS TOO SMALL FOR MY NEEDS

IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SET UP AN ANDROID PHONE TO THE BLUETOOTH 
IT WAS DISAPPOINTING THAT THERE WAS NOT AN OPTION FOR A CD PLAYER IN THIS MODEL 
IT WAS MY CHOICE TO GO WITH A LESS DYNAMIC SPEAKER SYSTEM 
IT WAS NOT HARD TO LEARN LIKE OTHER SYSTEMS CAN BE 
IT WAS ONLY A TEASE WITH 3 MONTHS OF SIRIUS RADIO SERVICE BEING A SENIOR I CAN T AFFORD THIS SERVICE FOR LONGER PERIODS 
IT WAS TOO SOON TO DO AWAY WITH THE CD PLAYER VERY DISAPPOINTED 
IT WAS VERY EASY TO LEARN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION ETC SETTING UP THE PHONE SYSTEM WAS SO EASY!
IT WILL BE BENEFICIAL IF THE DEALER CAN HELP SET UP THE BMWS CONNECTED I HAVE OWNED MY VEHICLE FOR 4 MONTHS AND IT HAS NOT BEEN INSTALLED 
IT WILL BE BETTER TO HAVE THE SOUND SEPARATELY SUCH AS FROM THE MOVIE SOUND TO THE REAR SIDE AND THE RADIO OR CD TO THE FRONT SIDE
IT WILL BE NICE TO USE REAR CAMERA ALL THE TIME NOT JUST IN REVERSE MODE
IT WILL BE PERFECT IF SPEAKER SOUND BETTER THAN WHAT IT IS NOW
IT WILL DO EVERYTHING WHEN I LEARN HOW TO USE IT!
IT WILL HELP YOU WITH GAS STATIONS RESTAURANTS NAVIGATION ALL THINGS A PERSON NEEDS IN TOWN OR AWAY FROM HOME LOVE SIRUS RADIO ALTHOUGH NOT AS IMPORTANT AS OTHER FEATURES NICE TO BE OFFERED IT & WE DO USE IT ONE THING I DON T LIKE IS HAVIN 
IT WILL NOT RECOGNIZE MY I PHONE 3 
IT WON T PAIR WITH MY DEVICE EVEN THOUGH IT IS SHOWN AS PAIRED 
IT WON T RECOGNIZE MY ANDROID PHONE YET PLAYS ZUNE???? WHO THE HELL STILL HAS ONE OF THOSE???
IT WORKD

IT WORKS FINE VOICE NAVIGATION IS DIFFUCULT
IT WORKS FOR ME BUT I NEVER USE ANYTHING BUT THE RADIO
IT WORKS GREAT THE INTERACTION WITH THE BLUETOOTH COULD BE A LITTLE EASIER HOWEVER THIS VERSION OF THE 2015 IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE 2012 
IT WORKS NOTHING EXCEPTIONAL 
IT WORKS REAL FAST TO GET YOU THE INFORMATION YOU ASK IT FOR THE SOUND SYSTEM ID SUPERB THE ADJUSTABLE LADY S VOICE GIVING DIRECTIONS IS EASY TO LISTEN TO 
IT WORKS REALLY WELL WITH MY PHONE BUT I DONT LIKE THAT I HAVE 2 2015 TOYOTA VEHICLES THAT ARE BASE MODELS ONE HAS A VOICE CONTROL BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE PRIUS HAS MORE FEATURES BUT DOES NOT HAVE THIS ONE 
IT WORKS VERY EASILY AS OPPOSED TO OTHER SYSTEMS I HAVE USED IN THE PAST THIS ONE IS THE BEST I HAVE USED THEREFORE THE 10 
IT WORKS WELL AND IS AN IMPROVEMENT OVER EARLIER MODELS OF FORDS I HAVE OR OWN TODAY 
IT WOTKS
IT WOULD ALL BE OUTSTANDING IF THEY USED A CONVEX MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
IT WOULD BE AWESOME TO HAVE MUSIC PLAY FOR AWHILE AFTER TURNING CAR OFF
IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO HAVE EXTENSIONS ON THE VISOR THAT PULL OUT TO ALLOW MORE SIDE WINDOW PROTECTION FROM THE SUN 
IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I KNOW HOW TO USE THESE SYSTEMS WHEN I TRIED TO USE THEM MY CAR SAID IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE I NEED TO TAKE A CLASS 
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE BOTH TOUCH SCREEN AND BUTTONS LIKE ON THE G37 TOUCH SCREEN ALONE IS HARD TO OPERATE ON BUMPY ROADS 
IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE CONVENTIONAL DASHBOARD AUDIO CONTROLS 
IT WOULD BE BETTER WITH TWO PIECE SUN VISORS 
IT WOULD BE CONVENIENT TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A TEXT MESSAGE USING VOICE COMMAND 
IT WOULD BE EASIER TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY TYPE IN THE NAME OF EACH CITY AND STREET CURRENTLY YOU TYPE IN THE FIRST FEW LETTERS AND THE COMPUTER FINDS WHAT IT THINKS YOU WANT AND GIVES YOU A FEW CHOICES I WANT TO BE 
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC IF I COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE TOYS IN MY NEW CAR HOWEVER THE VOICE RECOGNITION JUST DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ME! THE NAVIGATION IS USELESS I HAVE TO KNOW THE ADDRESS TO GET TO AN UNKNOWN PLACE IF I AM LOOKING FOR SAY A 
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE A USB PORT IN BACK SEATOTH PASSENGERS 
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I COULD CONNECT DIRECTLY WITH SIRI
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT WERE TOUCH SCREEN 
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT WOLD READ TEXT MESSAGES OR EVEN ALLOW ME TO COMPOSE THEN VIA VOICE RECOGNITION 
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE 2015 AZERA HAD THE FORWARD CRASH AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IN ADDITION TO THE FORWARD CRASH WARNING 
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE BACK WIPER COULD BE BIGGER 
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE CLUB EDITION HAD AN OPTION OF ADDING THE BOSE SOUND SYSTEM THE FACTORY SPEAKERS STILL SOUND GREAT AND ARE WAY BETTER THAN MY OLD CARS BUT HAVING THE OPTION OF UPGRADING WOULD BE NICE ALSO ITS 2015 I THINK IT NEEDS TO HA 
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE HAND S FREE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM WOULD RELAY COMMANDS TO MY IPOD I E SIRI WHILE IN BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO PUSH THE BUTTON ON THE IPHONE ITSELF TO ACTIVATE SIRI 
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE NAMES IN THE PHONE AUTOMATICALLY MERGED WITH THE CAR S SYSTEM AND YOU COULD EASILY SAY THE PERSON S NAME AND THE CAR WOULD RECOGNIZE IT ESPECIALLY WITHOUT SO MANY STEPS 
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE SUN VISORS HAD A SLIDING CAPABILITY OR A PIECE THAT SLID OUT TO BLOCK EXTRA SUN

LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS HAVE A DEFINITE HORIZONTAL LIGHT BEAM AHEAD AND THEN VERY DARK AREA JUST ABOVE ALMOST LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING COVERING THE TOP VIEW AHEAD DIFFERENT!

LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS SHINE TOO LOW ON THE ROAD TO BE EFFECTIVE 
LOW BEAM HID HEADLIGHTS NOT AIMED HIGH ENOUGH TOLD NOT ADJUSTABLE 
LOW BEAM IS CUT STRAIGHT ACROSS AT TOP OF BEAM
LOW BEAMS ARE MEDIOCRE
LOW BEAMS ARE NOT AS BRIGHT AS THEY SHOULD BE IN MY OPINION

LOW BEAMS OF HEADLIGHTS SEEM TO BE LIMITED IN DISTANCE SHARP CUT OFF AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE 
LOW BEAMS SEEM TO HAVE A AREA THAT IS CUT OFF OF THE TOP OF THE BEAM THEY SHINE GOOD ON THE ROAD BUT MAY LACK VISIBILITY DOWN THE ROAD DUE TO THE TOP BEING SHADED?

LOWER QUALITY INTERIOR MATERIALS THEN PAST MODELS
LOWER RATING FOR VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES BECAUSE OF LARGER BLIND SPOT BLIND SPOT DUE TO VEHICLE STYLING COMPENSATION FOR THIS IS PROVIDED BY MORE MORE FREQUENTLY CHECKING OF MIRRORS AND HIGHER AWARENESS OF TRAFFIC CONDIT 
LOWER THE COST TOO MUCH MONEY FOR A SYSTEM THAT GENERALLY DOES NOT SOUND BETTER THAN A BOSE GM SYSTEM AND ADD A DIFFERENT AMBIENT BACKGROUND LIGHT VERY BORING RED RED AND MORE RED 
LOWER THE DEVICE OR TILT BETTER SO SUN DOES NOT REFLECT ON IT HARD TO SEE THE SCREEN WHEN BACKING UP INTO THE SUN
LOWER THE PRICES FOR THE BETTER SYSTEMS INCREASE THE QUALITY

MANY APPLICATIONS
MANY BLIND SPOTS
MANY BLIND SPOTS FROM SEATS AND DOOR POSTS
MANY BLIND SPOTS SO WE NEED TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES 
MANY BLIND SPOTS TO OVERCOME 
MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP AND PARKING WHEN I PARK IN A TIGHT SPACE IT LIKES I AM GOING TO HIT THE CAR ON MY RIGHT ALTHOUGH I MAY HAVE 2 OR 3 FEET OF SPACE THIS DIDN T HAPPEN WITH MY FIRST 2 COROLLAS AND MY 2 CAMRYS ALSO IT S HARD TO S 
MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
MANY BLIND SPOTS WITH CONER POSTS 
MANY BUTTONS SOME REDUNDANCY AND WHEN YOU HIT VOIUCE BUTTON IT TAKES FOREVER FOR IT TO STOP TELLING YOU MENU
MANY CAPABILITIES JUST HAVEN T MASTERED THE USE OF THEM YET
MANY CARS FLASH HEADLIGHTS THINKING OUR VEHICLE S HIGH BEAMS ARE ON THE HUGE WINDSHIELD REQUIRES A LARGER VISOR
MANY CHOICES OF WHAT I NEED TO DO
MANY CONTROLS DO THE SAME THING 
MANY DON T WORK WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING MERCEDES NEEDS TO ALLOW PASSENGER CONTROL DISABLING HALF THE CARS FEATURES WHILE MOVING DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF HAVING THEM UNDER THE GUISE OF SAFETY 
MANY EXTRA FEATURES WHICH I CHOOSE NOT TO USE CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF I BELIEVE IT IS A SAFETY HAZARD TO BE USING A LOT OF EXTRA ELECTRONIC CRAP WHILE DRIVING A VEHICLE THEY ARE FOR TRANSPORTATION NOT A ROLLING LOUNGE CHAIR 
MANY FEATURES
MANY FEATURES 
MANY FEATURES AND EASE OF USE
MANY FEATURES DEPENDENT UPON SERVICE PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTY SYSTEMS ACTUALLY IN FACT OWNED BY MERCEDES BUT DISGUISED TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY THAT ARE OVERPRICED WITH INCOMPETENT AND OFTEN HOSTILE AND DISHONEST EMPLOYEES WHO OBVIOUSLY FEEL NO RE 
MANY FEATURES OPTIONS CONTROLS ETC FOR THOSE WHO NEED COMPUTERIZED INFO/ENTERTAINMENT TO ENJOY DRIVING THE CAR I DON T 
MANY FEATURES THAT ARE EASY TO LOCATE AND EMPLOY 
MANY GOOD FEATURES STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TOUCH SCREEN BLUETOOTH 
MANY IPOD PLAYLIST FUNCTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS 
MANY MORE FEATURES ON GPS THAN 2012 ELANTRA BETTER COLOR SCHEMES WOULD LIKE A MORE RECENT UPDATE TO THE MAPS WITHOUT HAVING TO PAY $200 FOR IT THOUGH 
MANY OPTIONS FOR MEDIA PLAYBACK
MANY PRESELECTS FOR RADIO STATIONS
MANY THINGS TO LEARN ABOUT HOW TO USE IT
MANY TIMES DIFFICULT TO SWITCH THE SOURCE OF AUDIO AND DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE BLUETOOTH CONTROLLED PHONE FOR MUSIC
MANY TIMES WHEN I TRY TO DO A VOICE COMMAND A PHONE NUMBER IS DIALED IT MAY BE WHEN I M TRYING TO ENTER AND ADDRESS OR CONTROL AUDIO OF HVAC BECAUSE OF THIS I RARELY TRY TO USE THE VOICE COMMANDS SINCE IT ALWAYS TRIES TO CALL SOMEONE 
MANY TIMES WHEN TRYING TO USE VOICE COMMANDS FAILED TO WORK PROPERLY 
MANY VOICE COMMANDS ARE UNDERSTOOD BY THE SYSTEM
MAP
MAP AND ACCESS TO SIRIUSXM
MAP COLORS NAVIGATION CURSOR COLOR 
MAP COULD BE BETTER IN SHOWING CURRENT STREET
MAP DISPLAY ABOVE STEERING WHEEL IN DRIVER INFORMATION SCREEN 
MAP DISPLAY COULD BE EASIER TO READ 
MAP DISPLAY SHOULD INCLUDE CURRENT SPEED AND SPEED LIMIT MORE DETAIL AVAILABLE IN MAP CONTROL OF ENTIRE SYSTEM CAN BE CONFUSING 
MAP FEATURE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS ME TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I AM AT ALL TIMES 
MAP FUNCTIONS ARE NOT TREMENDOUSLY INTUITIVE 
MAP IS POOR FOR WEATHER
MAP IS THE MOST ACCURATE AND DETAILED I HAVE EVER SEEN 
MAP LOOKS GREAT HOWEVER WAZE IS A BETTER WAY TO NAVIGATE WISH IT WERE POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE A NAV APP TO THE AUTO 
MAP LOOKS OUTDATED CAN BE DIFFICULT TO READ/FOLLOW 
MAP MUST DARKEN AT NIGHT STREET AHEAD DIALOG BOX SEE GARMIN S GPS 
MAP ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT AS NICE AS OTHER VEHICLES I LOOKED AT OUT OF DATE IPHONE 5 INTEGRATION SYSTEM NOT VERY USEFUL
MAP POOR SEE ABOVE STREET NAMES SMALL ALSO VOICE USED IN GUIDANCE CAN T BE INCREASED RADIO DROWNS OUT
MAP QUEST
MAP SHOULD SHOW THE STREET YOUR ON MORE PROMINENTLY SEE LEXUS 
MAP SHOWS WHERE YOU ARE BUT YOU CAN T MOVE IT TO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO ANTICIPATE OR EXPLORE FURTHER DOWN IN THE ROUTING 
MAP UPDATES MANY POI NOT LISTED IN CAR BUT ARE AVAILABLE ON MY IPHONE MAP 
MAP UPDATES MORE FREQUENT 
MAP VERY SLOW TO SCROLL AND DETAIL SUFFERS UNLESS ZOOMED IN VERY CLOSE WOULD BE NICE IF IT OPERATED MORE LIKE GOOGLE MAPS 
MAP VIEWS
MAPPING IS NOWHERE NEAR AS EFFECTIVE OR ADVANCED AS GOOGLE MAPS VOICE RECOGNITION COMMANDS ARE NOT INTUITIVE ENOUGH AND THE PROMPTS ARE INFERIOR TO OTHER SIMILAR SYSTEMS 
MAPPING SYSTEM ISN T THE BEST PREFER WAZE HAVENT BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THE VOICE SYSTEM YET 
MAPS
MAPS AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM ARE UNACCEPTABLE I HAVE ALWAYS USED A GARMEN AND FIND IT MANY MANY TIMES BETTER THAN THE TOYOTA SYSTEM I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT TRUST THE SYSTEM TO TAKE ME ON THE CORRECT ROUTE AND TO THE DESIRED LOCATION IF THERE IS ON 
MAPS ARE 18 MONTHS OLD AND WAY TOO COSTLY TO UPDATE AND THERE ISN T EVEN AN UPDATE AVAILABLE YET 
MAPS ARE CLEAR AND ADJUST WELL TO THE DESTINATIONS 
MAPS ARE CLEAR NEXT TURN IS POSTED IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER THIS IS AWESOME!
MAPS ARE OUT OF DATE VOICE SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT AT TIMES MAY BE BECAUSE OF DATA BEING OUT OF DATE 
MAPS ARE OUTDATED
MAPS ARE TERRIBLE WRONG DESTINATIONS USELESS
MAPS INACCURATE MANY TIMES ONLY DISLIKE
MAPS JUST NEED TO BE UP TO DATE AND THE VOICE CONTROL WALKS YOU THROUGH WAY TO MANY STEPS YOUR DONE WITH YOUR TRIP BY THE TIME YOU GET EVERYTHING SAID EASIER TO STOP AND TYPE IT IN
MAPS NEED MORE UPDATING OR EASIER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO USE
MAPS NOT UPDATED
MAPS WITH AUDIO
MARK IT MORE SIMPLE OR LINK WITH IPHONE SO THAT THE TWO NAV SYSTEM COULD BE DELAYED ON THE CARS SYSTEM 
MARK LEVINGSTON SOUND SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HAVE NEVER HEARD A SOUND SYSTEM LIKE THIS IS A CAR 
MARK LEVINSON SOUND SYSTEM IS AMAZING
MARK LEVINSON SOUND SYSTEM QUALITY IS EXCELLENT
MARK LEVINSON SYSTEM
MARK LEVINSON SYSTEM WAS NOWHERE AS GOOD AS SYSTEM IN MY 2007 LEXUS VERY DISAPPOINTING 
MARK LEVISON SOUND SYSTEM
MARKEDLY IMPROVED SYSTEMS WHEN COMPARED TO OUR PRIOR 2013 M CLASS
MASS OF CORNER POST
MASSIVE BLIND SPOTS!
MATERIAL BODY IS MADE OF IS CHEAP I CAN COMPRESS IT AND IT FLEXES BACK WITH NOT MUCH PRESSURE
MATERIAL OF SEATS
MATERIAL QUALITY
MATERIALS
MAX SEAT HEIGHT
MAXIMUM SEAT HEIGHT ON 335I SEEMS A BIT LOW IT CAN BE INCREASED BY A COUPLE OF INCHES SUN VISOR AT LEAST FOR PASSENGER SHOULD BE MORE SUBSTANTIAL AND PERHAPS ADJUSTABLE IN LENGTH 
MAXIMUM VOLUME IS TOO LOW FOR MY TASTES THEN AGAIN I M QUITE THE AUDIOPHILE 
MAY AN EXTENDER FOR THE VISORS WOULD HELP COVER WHERE THE VISOR DOESN T COVER THE SUN 
MAY BE I JUST NEED TO GET USED TO THE VEHICLE 
MAY BE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT LOOKING TOWARD RIGHT FRONT 
MAY SOUND DUMB BUT THE WASHER FLUID COMES OUT REALLY WELL NO WAITING 10 MINUTES TO GET A CLEAN WINDSHIELD
MAYBE A BIGGER SCREEN IT WOULD BE EASIER TO READ OR LARGER BOLDER PRINT
MAYBE A COURSE ON HOW TO USE IT EITHER ONLINE OR IN THE DEALERSHIP
MAYBE A HIGHER GRADE OF WINDSHIELD WIPER SHOULD BE USED AS STANDARD
MAYBE A LITTLE BETTER SPEAKERS OR A LITTLE EASIER NAV SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS
MAYBE A LITTLE MORE POWER TO THE FRONT PART OF THE PASSENGER CABIN
MAYBE A MORE DETAILED MAP ON NAV 
MAYBE A WRITTEN OPERATORS MANUAL ON THE SYSTEM WOULD HELP 
MAYBE ADDING MORE SAFETY FEATURES LIKE CHANGING LANE WARNING
MAYBE BE ABLE TO GO BACKWARD IN CHOOSING BETWEEN AM/FM/SATELLITE PANELS 
MAYBE COULD SIT A LITTLE HIGHER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY SINCE ITS A CROSSOVER
MAYBE FREE UPDATES TO DISPLAY AND SYSTEM BUT OVERALL THE SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING
MAYBE I JUST DON T KNOW HOW TO USE IT BUT RUN MY IPOD THROUGH AN AUDIO JACK AND I PLUG INTO A USB FROM THE ACCESSORY OUTLET TO KEEP IT CHARGED I WISH I COULD JUST PLUG MY IPOD INTO A PORT ON THE DASHBOARD 
MAYBE I JUST HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THIS YET IF I PLUG IN MY PHONE SO I CAN HAVE SAY MAPQUEST COME THROUGH THE SPEAKERS I CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE THE RADIO ON AT THE SAME TIME 
MAYBE I M TOO OLD BUT IT ALL SEEMS TO BE MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT NEEDS TO BE MODERN ELECTRONICS ALLOWS A MYRIAD OF CHOICES TO BE OFFERED ON ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF EVERYTHING AND FRANKLY I DON T NEED ALL THAT CRAP GLAD I DIDN T GET THE RADIO W 
MAYBE I NEED SOME LESSON ON HOW TO USE SYSTEM 
MAYBE IT CAN ALREADY DO THIS BUT I DON T KNOW HOW TO ACCESS A PHONE NUMBER FOR SOMEONE UNLESS I HAVE CALLED THEM ON MY CAR PHONE RECENTLY THEY ARE LISTED CHRONOLOGICALLY IN THE ORDER THEY WERE CALLED 
MAYBE IT S JUST ME BUT I DO NOT LIKE THE DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS SIDE MIRRORS THE FACT THAT I FEEL LIKE I AM LOOKING THROUGH BIFOCALS WHEN TRYING TO SWITCH LANES IS BOTHERSOME AND HURTS MY EYES TO TRY TO ADJUST TO THE TYPE OF MIRROR I AM LOOKING AT 
MAYBE ITS MY SOUTHERN TX TWANGY ACCENT??
MAYBE ONCE A PERSON HAS ESTABLISHED THEIR PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH WITH THE VEHICLE THEY WOULDN T HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO MANY STEPS TO MAKE A CALL 
MAYBE PUT BROWSING ABILITY FOR MUSIC ON THE CONSOLE CLOSE TO THE SHIFTER TO EASILY REACH THE CONTROLS MY OLDER AFTER MARKET STEREOS COME WITH REMOTE CONTROLS AND THEY ARE VERY CONVENIENT FOR BROWSING THROUGH LARGE LIBRARIES OF MUSIC SUCH AS MY 12 
MAYBE THEY COULD ADD A TOUCH SCREEN
MAYBE THEY SHOULD ADD THE NEW SUN BLOCKERS TO THE VISOR 
MAYBE THIS WILL BE COVERED IN A LATER SECTION I THINK THE STEERING IS TOO RESPONSIVE ALMOST TO THE POINT OF DISTRACTION IN OTHER WORDS VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT OF THE WHEEL PRODUCES TOO MUCH MOVEMENT ON THE PAVEMENT I HAVE TO SAY THAT I CANNOT 
MAYBE WHEN I GET USE TO THE CONTROLS I WILL LIKE THEM BUT RIGHT NOW I THINK THEY AT TIMES ARE NOT USER FRIENDLY AND UNSAFE 
MAYBE WOULD USE MORE IF THE SALESMAN HAD BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEM AND SHOWED ME I WAS TOD TO WORK WITH IT AND COME BACK FOR HELP BUT AFTER THE DURATION OF THE LEASE EXPERIENCE I WAS NOT INTERESTED ON GOING BACK FOR ANY HELP I DETEST WHE 
MAZDA INFOTAINMENT DISPLAY IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO COLLAPSE IT TURN SLIGHTLY TOWARDS A DRIVER OR PASSENGER IT WOULD BE GREAT TO LET PASSENGER ENTER ADDRESS DESTINATIONS WHILE DRIVING 
MAZDA RADAR CRUISE CONTROL
MAZDA REMOVED WI FI AND INTERNET CONNECTED SERVICES FUNCTIONALITY SO THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM HAS LIMITED USEFULNESS 
MB S TOP END AUDIO SYSTEMS ARE WAY OVER PRICED AND I REFUSE TO BUY THEM THE NEXT LEVEL DOWN IS GOOD BUT INCONSISTENT WITH THE CLASS OF VEHICLE 
MBRACE IS THE BEST PART OF THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN THE ENTIRE CAR IT IS SO EASY TO PRESS THE BUTTON AND SPEAK TO A LIVE PERSON TO GET WHATEVER INFORMATION OR HELP THAT WE NEED 
MCLAREN SOUND SYSTEM
MDX S HAVE ALWAYS HAD A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING BACK WHAT I DO LOVE IS THE NEW SAFETY FEATURE THAT TELLS YOU WHEN SOMEONE IS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU WHETHER IN THE FRONT OR BACK OF THE CAR THIS HELPS WITH THE BLIND SPOT PROBLEM 
MEDIA
MEDIA BUTTON AND RADIO BUTTON ARE GREAT 
MEDIA CONNECTION AND USB PORTS INCLUDED
MEDIA HAS TOO MANY BUTTONS TO PUSH TO GET TO DESIRED SPOT SHOULD ALSO ALLOW BURN FROM CD INSTEAD OF FROM MEDIA STICK 
MEDIA NOT EXPLAINED CLEARLY
MEDIA PLAYER AND USB
MEDIA STREAMING FROM MY ANDROID PHONE
MEDIA SYSTEM IS SLOW TO SWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT OPTIONS E G RADIO TO BLUETOOTH 
MEDIA TO PLAY I TUNES WITH OUT A CORD
MEDIOCRE HANDLING IN SNOW
MEDIOCRE STANDARD HEADLIGHTS SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED OPTIONAL LED/XENONS WHICH SHOULD BE STANDARD ON A CAR THAT IS SOLD AT A VERY HIGH PRICE 
MEETS ALL MY NEEDS JUST FINE
MEMORY SEAT
MEMORY SEATS
MEMORY STATION DON T HAVE TO CHANGE FROM AM TO FM
MENTIONED BEFORE THE REAR HEADRESTS DO CAUSE A VISIBILITY ISSUE IT IS THE HEIGHT AND THE SHAPE OF THE HEADREST 
MENTIONED EARLIER THE VISORS ARE SUB STANDARD TO OTHER VEHICLES WE SHOPPED IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE
MENTIONED ELSEWHERE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS CAN BLOCK VISIBILITY OF VEHICLES PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS WHEN ENTERING TRAFFIC FROM SIDE STREET 
MENTIONED IT BEFORE BUT THERE IS A SERIOUS BLIND SPOT MAYBE FOR FUTURE DESIGNS INCLUDE THE SMALLER MIRROR INSIDE THE BIGGER SIDE MIRROR TO HELP AIDE IN CHANGING LANES WHEN SOMEONE IS RIDING IN YOUR BLIND SPOT OTHER THAN THAT I REALLY LOVE THIS 
MENU BOARD
MENU DESCRIPTION WHEN VOICE TEXTING IS CUMBERSOME VOICE READ BACK OF TEXTS IS VERY RUDIMENTARY COMPARED TO OTHER CURRENT ELECTRONIC DEVICES
MENU DOESN T COMPARE TO THE BMW IDRIVE SYS FOR BEING LEXUS THEY WENT OUT CHEAP IN DESIGNING THE WAY YOU MOVE AROUND THE MENU DOESN T EVEN MAKE SENSE HOPEFULLY AFTER BUYING THIS CAR NEW LEXUS WILL FIND A WAY TO PERFORM AND LOOK WILL 
MENU FOR NAVIGATION DEVICE SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE AND PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION 
MENU HAS TOO MANY CHOICES SOUND IS UNEQUAL ?SPEAKERS OR SOFTWARE NEEDS UPGRADING 
MENU IS NOT THAT INTUITIVE FEATURES ARE NUMEROUS AND THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR THE PCM AUDIO & COMMUNICATIONS + NAV SYSTEM IS THICKER THAN THE BIBLE IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT CERTAIN FEATURES DO TALK TO APPLE S UI DESIGNERS
MENU NAVIGATION AND INSTRUCTIONS COULD BE SIMPLIFIED
MENU NEEDS TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY 
MENU OF DISPLAY COULD BE EASIER TO NAVAGATE
MENU ON THE DISPLAY CAN BE A LITTLE MORE USER FRIENDLY
MENU PROMPTS SIMPLER & VOICE RECOGNITION BETTER
MENU S DRIVE YOU TO MENU S WITH ONLY ONE OPTION THEN YOU HAVE TO SELECT THAT OPTION AGAIN TO GET TO THE SCREEN TO SELECT WHAT OPTION OR FEATURE YOU WANT TWO SCREENS BACK MAKE IT SIMPLE I AM TRYING TO DRIVE REALLY MISS THE CD PLAYER I LIKE AUDIO 
MENU SCREEN ALLOWS FAST MOVEMENT BETWEEN APPLICATIONS AND INFORMATION
MENU SELECTION FOR SATELLITE RADIO COULD BE BETTER 
MENU STRUCTURE SHOULD BE SIMPLIFIED
MENU THAT CONTROLS AUDIO TEMP ETC
MENUES CAN BE CONFUSING 
MENUES DIFFICULT TO OPERATE WITH TOUCH PAD IT IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING TOO DISTRACTING VOICE CONTROLS LIMITED
MENUS AND CONTROLS ARE NOT INTUITIVE
MENUS AND SEQUENCES NEED COMPLETE REDESIGN
MENUS ARE NOT INTUITIVE OR WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE OWNER MANUAL RATHER DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOSE SOUND QUALITY COMPARED TO MY 2003 BOSE SYSTEM IN MY MERCEDES ML350 10 YEARS SHOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT BUT ACTUALLY NOT SO MUCH VERY DISAPPOINTED TH 
MENUS ARE SO DETAILED YOU CAN T OR SHOULD NOT USE THEM WHILE DRIVING 
MENUS COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
MENUS FOR FINDING DIFFERENT AUDIO SOURCES NOT ALWAYS INTUITIVE VOICE RECOGNITION CLUMSY AT TIMES
MERCEDES BENZ APPS HAVE NEVER WORKED INTERNET RADIO IS A BUST AND THE CAR NEVER GETS A SIGNAL EVEN WITH ASSISTANCE MULTIPLE TIMES FROM THE HELP LINE AND FORGET ABOUT GOING ON LINE THE CONNECTION IF IT OCCURS CAN TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES AND THE PA 
MERCEDES HAS DONE SO MUCH TO INSURE SAFETY AND VISIBILITY THIS IS MY 3RD MERCEDES BENZ E CLASS I CAN SEE THE PROGRESS MERCEDES HAS MADE WITH EACH NEW E I OWN 
MERGING INTO RIGHT HAND TRAFFIC IS HARD TO SEE THRU THE BACK WINDOWS FORWARD VISIBILITY IS HAMPERED BY THE WINDSHIELD SUPPORT POST WHILE MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN 
MERIDIAN AUDIO
METHOD OF ENTERING DESTINATION ADDRESS TO NAV SYSTEM ALSO NO CD CHANGER AVAILABLE!
METHOD OF ENTERING DESTINATION IS A BIT CUMBERSOME ALSO WOULD LIKE CAR TO REMEMBER DEVICES CELL PHONES BY BLUETOOTH 
MIC ABOVE PASSENGER FOR PHONE CALLS SPEAKER QUALITY WITH MORE BASS 
MIC FOR BLUETOOTH IS NOT VERY GOOD SOUND QUALITY DURING CALLS IS POOR AT BEST
MIC SHOULD BE BACK OVER BY DRIVERS HEAD SO PEOPLE CAN HEAR THEM BETTER LIKE BEFORE!
MIC TO PICKUP DRIVER S VOICE LOCATED ON PASSENGER SIDE OF CAR HARD FOR OTHER PARTY TO CLEARLY HEAR MY VOICE AT TIMES 
MICROPHONE
MICROPHONE AND/OR SOFTWARE BETTER AT UNDERSTANDING THE DIAL PERSON NAME COMMAND 
MICROPHONE DOES NOT WORK
MICROPHONE FOR HANDS FREE CALLS
MICROPHONE FOR THE CAR TO HEAR MY COMMANDS! IT CAN HEAR I AM TALKING BUT DOESNT UNDERSTAND FULLY ALSO NEED TO MAKE THE VOICE COMMAND RESPOND TO THE NORMAL LINGO OF WORDS YOU HAVE TO TALK PERFECT TO HER OR SHE WONT UNDERSTAND! NEED TO WIDEN THE 
MICROPHONE IS MUCH BETTER LOCATED THAN IN PRIOR VEHICLE MUCH EASIER TO CARRY ON A HAND S FREE PHONE CONVERSATION THAN IN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE 
MICROPHONE IS OFTEN TIMES NOT LEGIBLE 
MICROPHONE ON PHONE CALLS 
MICROPHONE PLACEMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE CLEAR INPUT FOR VOICE RECOGNITION FOR BUILT IN FEATURES OR FOR BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO A CELL PHONE 
MICROPHONE PLACEMENT FOR PHONE CALLS 
MICROPHONE QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING MY MOTHER PREFERS I CALL HER WHEN I M DRIVING DUE TO THE EXCELLENT QUALITY OF THE VEHICLE MICROPHONE 
MICROPHONE/BLUETOOTH TO ALLOW HANDSFREE CALLS WHEN DRIVING
MICROSOFT UVO CAN BE ELIMINATED I TRIED SETTING IT UP BUT SOON REALIZED IT WAS JUST A CLUNKY AND STRANGE APPLICATION MULTIPLE BLUETOOTH CONNECTED PHONES IN THE CAR CAN CAUSE SOME ISSUES AUDIO CONTROLS FOR STATION PRESETS ARE ONLY USEFUL WITH TH 
MID BAND EQ IS QUITE FLAT ESPECIALLY FOR ROCK TYPE MUSIC 
MID BASS IS LACKING MID RANGE IS FLAT AND THERE S NO SUB BASS AT ALL NAVIGATION IS AVAILABLE IN DIRECT RIVALS FROM TOYOTA ALSO A REAR VIEW CAMERA IS NOW STANDARD IN ALL HONDA 
MIDDLE CONSOLE MATERIAL
MIDDLE CONSOLE STORAGE NOT DEEP ENOUGH
MIDDLE HEADREST IN BACK BLOCKS VISIBILITY
MIDDLE ROW CENTER HEADREST MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT BACK WINDOW
MIDDLE SEAT HEAD RESTS ARE TOO HIGH 
MIDDLE STORAGE BOX
MIGHT LOOK COMPLICATED BUT IT IS VERY EASY TO NAVIGATE 
MIKE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED THE VOICE IS NOT CLEAR TO THE PERSON ON THE PHONE ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE SITTING ON THE PASSENGER SEAT THE OTHER PERSON CANT HEAR YOU AND SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF CAR VOICE THE VOICE NOT AUDIBLE MIKE NEEDS TO NOISE

MIND BLOWING STEREO SYSTEM 
MINE DIDN T COME WITH A LOT OF EXTRA S BUT WE DON T REALLY USE THESE SO WHAT WE HAVE IS JUST FINE FOR US AND OUR NEEDS 
MINE DIDN T COME WITH BUILT IN NAVIGATION 
MINE IS A CONVERTIBLE AND REAR VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR DOWN LOW WHERE A CAR FOLOWING YOU WOULD BE SEAT DOES NOT ADJUST UP IN HEIGHT ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE STRAIGHT BACK I AM 5 8 
MINE IS A CONVERTIBLE THE VISIBILITY WHEN TOP IS UP IS LIMITED ESPECIALLY WHEN BACKING UP 
MINE IS NOT AN ALL WHEEL DRIVE
MINI CONNECTED IS NOT AT ALL USER FRIENDLY I GAVE UP!
MINI CONNECTED SOFTWARE INCONSISTENT AND DOESN T WORK WELL AS ADVERTISED

MINIMAL POWER
MINIMAL STORAGE SPACE
MINOR BLIND SPOTS TO THE REAR QUARTERS BUT NO WORSE THAN OTHER CARS I VE OWNED
MINOR ISSUES TO DEAL WITH
MIRROR
MIRROR ALIGNMENT IS A LITTLE TRICKY WITH THE SHAPE OF THE GLASS BUT BLIND SPOT WARNING MAKES IT ALMOST A NON ISSUE 
MIRROR BLIND SPOT WARNING
MIRROR BLIND SPOTS LARGER TOWING MIRRORS
MIRROR BLOCKS VIEW WHEN MAKING LEFT TURN 
MIRROR BLOCKS VISION AT TIMES 
MIRROR HAS A BLIND SPOT WHEN YOU ARE CHANGING LANES THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT CORNER ON OUR 2012 JETTA WE COULD SLIDE THE VISOR TO BLOCK THE SUN AND ON OUR 2015 JETTA WE CAN T DO THIS AND IT CAUSES A HAZARD 
MIRROR LINK DOES NOT WORK WOULD LOVE A NAV SYSTEM THAT USES MY PHONE S APPS INSTEAD OF MANUFACTURER NAV
MIRROR LINK WITH PHONE
MIRROR SIGNAL WHEN SOMEONE IS NEXT TO YOU IS GREAT! ESPECIALLY ON CALIFORNIA CROWED FREEWAYS
MIRROR SLIGHTLY TOO BIG BLOCK PART OF THE VIEW WHEN MAKING LEFT TURN BUT NOT A BIG DEAL 
MIRRORING OF PHONE APPLE CARPHONE CONNECTIVITY 
MIRRORLINK VERSION IN THE CAR IS OUTDATED AND DOES NOT SUPPORT ANY NEWER PHONES HOPING THEY PROVIDE FREE UPGRADES AND DO NOT SKIP IT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO MY DAILY DRIVING 
MIRRORS
MIRRORS ARE A BIT SMALL
MIRRORS ARE A PAIN TO SEE VEHICLES IN BLIND SPOT
MIRRORS ARE ADEQUATE BUT I WOULD WANT THE LANE CHANGING DEVICE IN MY NEXT VEHICLE
MIRRORS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH TARGA ROOF ROLL HOOP REAR BLIND SPOTS 
MIRRORS ARE SOMEWHAT CONFUSING DUE TO TWO PARTS 
MIRRORS ARE TO SMALL
MIRRORS ARE TOO BIG
MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL
MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL AND THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR BLENDS INTO OVERALL SIZE OF MIRROR SO YOU HAVE A HARD TIME ADJUSTING FOCUS ON PROPER MIRROR DANGEROUS BLIND SPOTS EVERYWHERE 
MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL BLIND SPOTS DUE TO A PILLAR BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR SEATS
MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL NOW CAN T SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES TOWING OR BACKING POORER VISIBILITY AROUND THE MIRROR AREA ALONG UPPER WINDOW BAD BLIND SPOT VIEW OUT OF THE REAR OF VEHICLE IS DIMINISHED AND IS A MUCH SMALLER AREA TO LOOK OUT OF 
MIRRORS ARE TWO PART BUT THE LOWER ONLY PROVIDES VIEW OF WHEELS COULD BE MUCH BETTER IF IT SHOWED THE ADJACENT LANE TRAFFIC I HAD AN 03 SIERRA AND THE VISOR HAD A POCKET SLIDE FOR USE ON THE SIDE WINDOW THAT COMPLETELY COVERED THE WINDOW WHEN IN 
MIRRORS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE
MIRRORS ARE VERY GOOD
MIRRORS BLOCK ONCOMING TRAFFIC
MIRRORS BLOCK SIGNIFICANT PIECES OF THE ROAD CLOSE IN AT LOW SPEED 
MIRRORS COULD BE LARGER
MIRRORS CREATE BLIND SPOTS TOUGH TO LOOK OVER DRIVER SHOULDER WHEN CHANGING INTO LEFT LANE ALSO THE LINES OF THE TRUCK ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT MAKE IT HARD TO GET CLOSE TO OBJECTS WHEN PARKING OR IN TIGHT SPACES 
MIRRORS DO NOT RETRACT AUTOMATICLY
MIRRORS HARD TO SET AND ADJUST FOR DIFFERENT DRIVERS
MIRRORS HAVE DIFFICULTY COVERING BLIND SPOTS
MIRRORS NEED A CONVEX PORTION TO SEE IN THE BLIND SPOT ALMOST ALL CARS HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY ALL THE CAR MANUFACTURES IT WOULD BE NICE THAT VOLVO RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM AND INSTITUTE A DUAL MIRROR TO SEE THE FULL 
MIRRORS NEED TO BE MORE ADJUSTABLE I CAN T RAISE THEM HIGH ENOUGH TO SEE MY BLIND SPOT SINCE I AM 6 5 
MIRRORS ON DRIVER SIDE DOES NOT COVER ENTIRE FIELD LIKE THE PASSENGER SIDE
MIRRORS SHOULD BE LARGER
MIRRORS SUCKS LOWER END TRUCK HAS NO FOG/DRIVING LIGHTS AND THERE IS NO OPTION TO UP GRADE
MIRRORS TO SMALL
MIRRORS TOO LARGE BLOCK VIEW
MIRRORS TOO SMALL
MIRRORS TOO SMALL AND SUN VISORS TOO SHORT ON SIDE SHOULD HAVE TELESCOPING VISOR LIKE OTHE GM MODELS
MIRRORS TOO SMALL BACK SEAT SECLUDES BACK WINDOW
MIRRORS WHEN IT RAINS GET TOO MUCH WATER TOO DIFFICULT TO SEE 
MIRRORS WITH THE LANE ASSIST PORTION IS A GREAT SAFETY FEATURE
MISINTERPRETATION OF INSTRUCTIONS
MISS BUTTON CONTROL OF RADIO AND EASY TO SET PREFERRED CHANNELS LIKE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS HAVE NOT TRIED IPOD DO NOT HAVE CELL PHONE STILL LEARNING SYSTEMS <900 MILES DRIVEN 
MISS HAVING A CD PLAYER IN THE CAR DONT UNDERSTAND WHY SOME DO NOT HAVE THEM??
MISS MY ADJUSTABLE FOOT PEDALS 
MISS MY OLD MINI COOPER
MISS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL WITHIN FM OR SIRUS WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
MISS THE CADILLAC FRONT HOOD EMBLEM
MISS THE EXTENDER THAT WAS ON THE VISOR OF MY G 37
MISS THE TOUCH SCREEN!
MISSED THE REAR WIPERS
MISSING A LOT OF STANDARD AUDIO/ENTERTAINMENT FEATURES FOUND IN LESS EXPENSIVE CARS LIKE BLUE TOOTH AUDIO TOUCH SCREEN ASSISTED PARKING CAMERA ETC TOO MANY TO LIST A $50K CAR SHOULD HAVE ALL OR MOST OF THESE BY DEFAULT 
MISSING CD PLAYER
MISSING WINDOWS PHONE APP FOR MINICOOPER
MITSUBISHI LACKS IN THIS AREA COMPARED TO OTHER MAKERS AS EXAMPLE DODGE HAS A VERY ADVANCED SYSTEM TO ALL FULL CONTROL IE CHANGE CHANNEL CHANGE VOLUME ALL FROM THE STERLING WHEEL NOTE MITSUBISHI DOES HAVE CONTROL BUTTONS ON THE WHEEL HOWEVE 
MMI CONTROL KNOB AS OPPOSED TO TOUCHING THE SCREEN
MMI INTEGRATION WITH APPLE IOS!!! AND EASE OF USE WITH VEHICLES JUKEBOX AND MUSIC APPS PANDORA IHEART ETC THEY ARE NOT AS EASY TO USE AND DON T OPERATE AS EASILY AS SATELLITE RADIO AND IPOD 
MMI INTERFACE IS VERY INTUITIVE AND EASY TO LEARN 
MMI IS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY OVER 2013 SYSTEM
MMI IS VERY SIMPLE AND PLACED AT A GREAT LOCATION ON THE CONSOLE
MMI MENU STRUCTURE IS NOT INTUITIVE AND BURIES FUNCTIONALITY UNDER NUMEROUS LAYERS OF MENUS HARD TO USE ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING 
MMM
MO COMMENT
MOBILE PHONE AUDIO MENUS ARE CUMBERSOME
MODELS WITHOUT BLIND SPOT MONITORING SHOULD HAVE A MIRROR WITHIN A MIRROR FOR THE SIDE MIRRORS TO IMPROVE BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY OFFERING THIS AS AN ACCESSORY WOULD BE A GOOD SECOND OPTION 
MODERATE BLIND SPOTS BUT BUILT IN BLIND SPOT MIRROR DOES HELP SLIGHTLY BUT REAR VIEW MIRROR VISIBILITY IS A CHALLENGE 
MODERN
MODERN 
MODERN CARS HAVE SO MUCH TECHNOLOGY IT JUST SEEMS SO COMPLICATED THERE HAS BEEN A LEARNING CURVE AND I HAVE NOT EVEN TRIED TO CONNECT IPOD YET AT FIRST I JUST WANTED TO GET USED TO IT AS A CAR AND WORRY ABOUT ALL THE TECHNOLOGY FEATURES LATE 
MODERN FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS WITH BETTER USABILITY IS EXPECTED

MY 1997 BOSE SYSTEM IN MY ACURA CL 3 0 WAS BETTER THAN THE KRELL SYSTEM IN MY RLX 
MY 2007 SILVERADO HAD RAIN SENSING WIPERS I LIKED THAT FEATURE AND WISH I THEY WERE OFFERED ON THIS TRUCK 
MY 2010 LACROSSE AND MY 2015 LACROSSE HAD BLIND AREAS WHICH IS WHY WE ORDERED ALL THE NEW SAFETY FEATURES ON THE NEW VEHICLE !
MY 2011 HAD A SMALL FISH EYE MIRROR LOCATED ON THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR I FOUND IT USEFUL AND MAY BE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ON ALL VEHICLES 
MY 2012 JUKE COULD ACCESS MY IPOD REALLY FAST AND WAS SIMPLE TO USE THIS 2015 IS REALLY SLOW TO RECOGNIZE MY IPOD THEN IT HAS TO BUILD AN INDEX OF THE CONTENTS THEN IT S SLOW TO SCROLL THE CONTENTS THEN IT STARTS PLAYING THE AUDIO 5 10 SECOND 
MY 2015 CAMARO IS A WELL CONSTRUCTED VERY SAFE VEHICLE AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT 
MY 2015 TOYOTA COROLLA MAKES ME FEEL VERY SAFE WHEN I RIDE IN IT

MY A5 DOES NOT HAVE A USB PORT WHICH IS RIDICULOUS THEY HAVE A CABLE IN THE GLOVE BOX WHICH IS SPECIFIC TO AUDI THERE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE A USB AND IPOD DOC STANDARD!

MY ANDROID PHONE ON BLUETOOTH SOUNDS BETTER THROUGH CAR THAN THROUGH PHONE ITSELF SO EASY TO USE

MY BIGGEST GRIPE ABOUT FACTORY INSTALLED NAVIGATION IS THAT THE MAPS ARE ALREADY OUT OF DATE AT TIME OF VEHICLE PURCHASE AND IT COSTS $300 TO UPDATE THE MAPS! THE MOBILE APP WAZE DOES A BETTER JOB AS DOES A GARMIN DEVICE YOU CAN BUY FOR $100 AN 
MY BIGGEST ISSUE IS NAVIGATION THROUGH THE SYSTEM THE THING ITSELF WORKS GREAT BUT THERE ARE A FEW TWEEKS I D LIKE TO MAKE TO THE SETTINGS AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO TRACK THEM DOWN NOW I KNOW HOW TO FIND THEM MOSTLY SUCH AS REDUCING THE VOICE OF 
MY BIGGEST ISSUE IS WITH THE DELAY BETWEEN INITIAL ACCESS REQUEST FOR THE SYSTEMS AND THE TIME THEY ACTUALLY ACT ON THE COMMAND THE DELAY IS FRUSTRATING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU USE THESE FEATURES YOU USUALLY NEED THEM FAIRLY QUICKLY
MY BIGGEST ISSUE WITH VISIBILITY IS THERE THERE ARE SOME MAJOR BLIND SPOTS IN THE CAR THAT WILL HIDE AN ENTIRE VEHICLE WHEN IT ISN T QUITE WITHIN THE SIDE SENSORS ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WHEN I SIT DOWN IN THE DRIVER S SEAT EVEN WITH IT RAISED UP 
MY BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BIG COMPARED TO WHAT I AM USED TO ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS DRIVEN SMALLER CARS SO THAT MAY JUST COME WITH THE TERRITORY OF GOING BIGGER 
MY BLUETOOTH COULD BE IMPROVED 
MY BLUETOOTH CUTS IN AND OUT THROUGH OUT THE CALL I HAVE HAD TO PURCHASE A BLUETOOTH HEADSET 
MY BLUETOOTH DROPS CALLS FROM MY CELL PHONE OFTEN 
MY BLUETOOTH IS BETTER IN MY XC70 THAN IN MY PREVIOUS XC60 
MY BLUETOOTH WHEN ON CALLS IS EXCEPTIONALLY CLEAR IT SOUNDS BETTER THEN WHEN I M ACTUALLY TALKING THROUGH THE ACTUAL PHONE I FIND MYSELF HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS VIA THE BLUETOOTH IN MY CAR 
MY BUICK LUCERNE HAD WIPERS THAT CAME ON AUTOMATICALLY I LIKED THAT BETTER THAN HAVING TO TURN THEM ON THE WIPERS ALSO DON T SEEM TO HAVE INTERMITTENT ON THEM
MY C MAX HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST PLEASURABLE VEHICLES THAT MY WIFE AND I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED 
MY CALLS GET DROPPED SOMETIMES WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE

MY CAR DID NOT COME WITH NAVIGATION BUILT IN SO I PURCHASED THE CABLE KIT TO USE THE VEHICLE DISPLAY AND MY PHONE BUT THE I HAVE NOT YET BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING IT TO WORK CURRENTLY A WASTE OF MONEY THE TOUCH SCREEN COULE BE MORE ACCURATE 
MY CAR DIDN T COME WITH A USB?! I DON T HAVE A CD PLAYER WHICH IS FINE BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO HOOK UP AN MP3 PLAYER IPHONE ETC VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING 
MY CAR DIDNT COME WITH COOL AUDIO OR NAV SO I DONT CARE FOR IT MUCH
MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE A REARVIEW CAMERA THUS IT IS A CHALLENGE WHEN BACKING 
MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE A USB DRIVE HENCE CANNOT USE PEN DRIVES TO LISTEN TO MUSIC 
MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED IF WE THE CAR S OWNER WOULD RECEIVE SOME KIND OF TRAINING ABOUT THAT 
MY CAR DOESN T HAVE NAVIGATION OTHERWISE THE AUDIO IS THE PRIMARY ISSUE WITH THE OVERALL COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IF I PLAY FROM MY IPHONE PLAYLISTS THE AUDIO LEVEL MUST BE TURNED TWICE AS LOUD TO JUST HEAR IT THIS IS AGGRAVATING 
MY CAR DOESN T PLAY ANY MUSIC ON MY IPHONE THAT IS EMAILED TO ME AS A FILE ATTACHMENT MY OLD LEAF WOULD PLAY THOSE FILES WITHOUT ISSUE 
MY CAR HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS INSPIRE CONFIDENCE IN MY SAFETY WHEN DRIVING
MY CAR HAS MANY FEATURES THAT I HAVE NOT ACTIVATED OR DO NOT USE I DO NOT PHONE OR TEXT IN THE CAR WHILE I AM DRIVING TOO DISTRACTING! I HAVE TRIED THE INTERNET SERVICE AND IT DOES WORK BUT THAT WOULD BE TOO DISTRACTING WHILE I AM DRIVING 
MY CAR HAS THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM IF THIS IS NOT STANDARD EQUIPMENT IT SHOULD BE AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT IS NEXT TO YOU IN EITHER LANE BEHIND THE FRONT DOOR GLASS I WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE THE STYLING CHANGED TO MAKE THIS BETTER 
MY CAR HAS THE STOCK MIRROR FOR ANY NORMAL CAR BUT I WOULD PREFER A LARGER REAR VIEW MIRROR 
MY CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE AND VIEW THROUGH THE INSIDE REARVIEW MIRROR IS VERY RESTRICTED AND I MUST RELY ON THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS TO MONITOR TRAFFIC MORE THAN WITH PAST CARS I HAVE OWNED

MY CAR IS STILL NEW TO ME I HAVE LESS THAN 300 MILES OF MY DRIVING IT I STILL DID NOT LEARN ALL THE FEATURES SO IT IS HARD TO ANSWER MANY OF THE QUESTIONS NOT APPLICABLE SHOULD APPEAR MORE OFTEN 
MY CAR IS SUPPOSE TO READ MY TEXT MESSAGES BUT WITH READING THE MANUAL WE WERE UNABLE TO MAKE IT WORK WE WERE ALSO UNABLE TO SAVE PHONE NUMBERS ON CONSOLE 
MY CAR IS VERY BASIC SO I THINK IT S GREAT FOR WHAT I COULD AFFORD 
MY CAR RIDES VERY SMOOTH NO COMPLAINTS
MY CAR S AUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WORKS GREAT UNFORTUNATELY I NEED TO MASTER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I SUSPECT MASTERY WILL TAKE MORE TIME I MAKE INCORRECT VERBAL COMMANDS OR UNRECOGNIZABLE COMMANDS AND USING THE MASTER C

MY CORVETTE IS A 2015 MY FAMILY HAS 2012 AND 2013 FORD VEHICLES WITH MUCH FRIENDLIER TO USE SYSTEMS VOICE RECOGNITION REACTS MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY IN THE FORDS MAYBE CHEVROLET COULD REVIEW THE FORD SYSTEMS TO SEE WHAT I MEAN TH

MY HUSBAND IS ANNOYED BY THE BEEPING SOUND MADE WHEN HE CROSSES A LINE IN THE ROAD WITHOUT SIGNALING I DON T MIND IT MYSELF 
MY HUSBAND IS VERY IMPRESSED BY THE SIDE RANGE OF THE HEADLIGHTS SO YOU SEE NOT ONLY THE ROAD BUT THE SIDES OF THE ROADS TO BE AWARE OF POTENTIAL HAZARDS DEER ETC MUCH BETTER THAN EITHER OF HIS CARS FORD F150 TRUCK AND A VW TIGUAN

MY HUSBAND S FORD F150 LIMITED S SYSTEM IS ALL OVER MY LEXUS
MY HUSBAND SAYS THE LIGHTS ARE THE BRIGHTEST WE VE EVER HAD!
MY HUSBAND THINKS THE VIEW FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS NARROW AND POOR I DON T SEEM TO AGREE PERHAPS IT S BECAUSE HE IS TALLER??

MY ILX DOES NOT HAVE NAVIGATION!!!!!
MY INFINITI COUPE HANDLES BETTER
MY IPHONE 6 PLUS CONSTANTLY DISCONNECTS AND READS IPOD ERROR AFTER A COUPLE MINUTES I CAN ONLY USE BLUETOOTH AUDIO WITH MY PHONE 
MY IPOD DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE VERY LONG SO IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE USB PORT WAS HOT AT ALL TIMES CHARGING THE IPOD IF I DON T DRIVE THE CAR EVERY DAY THE IPOD HAS TO CHARGE UP ENOUGH TO OPERATE BEFORE PLAYING AND THEN MY SHUFFLE STARTS ALL 
MY JEEP IS AMAZING I LOVE IT ALL
MY JEEP S SOUND SYSTEM IS AMAZING!!
MY JOURNEY DOES NOT HAVE THE NAVIGATION FEATURE AND I WOULD HAVE LIKED ONE 
MY JUKE HANDLES VERY WELL ESPECIALLY IN WET CONDITIONS LATELY HERE IN DALLAS

MY KIA IS NOT A 4 WHEEL DRIVE AND I DID NOT MAKE IT OUT OF THE SNOW COVERED DRIVEWAY ONLY SLIGHTLY UPHILL 
MY KIDS CAN EACH WATCH THEIR OWN MOVIE DON T HAVE TO SHARE OR PLAY THE SAME GAMES
MY LANCER SHOULD CAME WITH A NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
MY LAST BMW 2010 528I CAME WITH SIRIUS XM THIS ONE DOES NOT AND I WISH THAT IT DID I USED THAT ALL THE TIME
MY LAST BUICK VERANO HAD BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND LANE DEPARTURE THESE SHOULD BE STANDARD NOT OPTIONAL ON ALL BUICKS THAT ALONE WOULD CREATE ADDED VALUE TO ME UNFORTUNATELY UNTIL I HAD SIGNED ALL PAPERS I DID NOT REALIZE THIS REGAL DID NO 
MY LAST CAR HAD A TOUCH SCREEN THAT WAS MORE INTUITIVE TO USE I M GETTING USED TO THE MMI SYSTEM BUT IT S NOT EASY TO USE 
MY LAST CAR HAD SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS IT IS FANTASTIC TO BE ABLE TO SEE EVERYTHING AND THE AIDS THE CAR HAS TO ALSO LET YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS THERE ARE GREAT 
MY LAST CAR S SYSTEM IN THE G37 SOUNDED MORE POWERFUL 
MY LAST CAR WAS 14 YEARS OLD THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS EVERYTHING I UNDERSTAND AND USE IS OUTSTANDING HOWEVER I HAVE A LEARNING CURVE WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SINCE THIS IS THE FI

MY LAST VEHICLE HAD SATELITE RADIO SATELITE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUILD IN THE DASH PHONE SYSTEM AND I PAID LESS FOR IT 
MY LAST VEHICLE WAS A BUICK AND THEIR SYSTEM WAS SO MUCH BETTER! IT WAS SO MUCH LESS CUMBERSOME AND VERY USER FRIENDLY FORD NEEDS TO LOOK TO BUICK AND THEN TRY AND REVAMP THEIR SYSTEM ALSO I LOVE LISTENING TO PANDORA AND SOMETHING SO SIMPLE 
MY LAST VEHICLE WAS A LEXUS AND WHEN I WAS USING HANDS FREE CALLING THE PERSON THAT I WAS TALKING TO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TELL THAT I WAS IN THE CAR IT IS VERY OBVIOUS TO ANYONE THAT I AM TALKING TO IN MY INFINITY THAT I AM IN THE CAR 
MY LINK
MY LS MODEL DOES NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR MY IPHONE MUSIC I HAVE TO USE A CORD TO PLAY MUSIC FROM MY PHONE OK BUT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME IT WOULD PLAY WITH BLUETOOTH LIKE MY PHONE CALLS THE PHONE CALL BLUETOOTH IS GREAT 
MY MAGELLAN UNIT IS FAR SUPERIOR TO BUILT IN NAVIGATION
MY MAIN CHALLENGE WITH THE TWO LEXUS CT HYBRIDS THAT I HAVE HAD IS THE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE IT IS DANGEROUS AND I AM SURPRISED THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN CORRECTED BETWEEN THE 2011 MODEL AND THE 2015 MODEL THIS FEATURE IS DANGEROUS AND 
MY MAIN ISSUE IS THE RADIO PRE SET OPTIONS IT S HARD TO GET TO ALL YOUR PRESETS!
MY MAJOR COMPLAINT AROUND VISIBILITY IS THE NARROW VIEW IN REAR VIEW MIRROR OUT BACK WINDOW HEADRESTS IMPEDED A BIT AND JUST THE SHEER SMALLNESS OF THE REAR WINDOW CONTRIBUTE TO THE SMALLNESS OF VIEW NOT THRILLED WITH THE VIEW THE DRIVER HAS LOO 
MY MARKING A 4 FOR REAR VISIBILITY REFERS ONLY TO THE USE OF MIRRORS THE BACK UP CAMERA IN THIS CAR IS A MUST 
MY MODEL DD NOT COME WITH VOICE CONTROL FOR HEATING/COOLING 
MY MODEL DOES NOT HAVE BLIND SPOT SIDE MIRRORS THAT SHOULD BE A FEATURE ON ALL VEHICLES ALSO HEADLIGHTS SHOULD SHUT OFF AUTOMATICALLY WHEN VEHICLE IS TURNED OFF MY LIGHTS I DID NOT REALIZE THIS UNTIL MY NEIGHBOR TOLD ME MY LIGHTS WERE ON 
MY MUSIC IS EASILY INTEGRATED INTO MY CAR
MY MUSIC SOUNDS GREAT AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO CHOOSE ABOUT 5 DIFFERENT LEVELS OF BACKGROUNDS OF SURROUND SOUND WHICH I HAVE NEVER HAD IN ANY OTHER VEHICLE THE SPEAKERS ARE PRETTY DARN GOOD AS WELL CONSIDERING THIS IS A SMALL CAR AND FOR IT S PRICE 
MY NAVIGATION APP FROM PHONE WILL NOT SPEAK THROUGH CAR SPEAKERS IF I AM USING ANOTHER SOURCE FOR MUSIC SIRIUS CD RADIO HAVE TO TURN OFF BLUE TOOTH IN ORDER TO HEAR PHONE DIRECTIONS DIRECTLY FROM PHONE THUS NOT ALLOWING HANDS FREE IF NECES 
MY NAVIGATION DOES NOT HAVE TRAFFIC INFORMATION EVEN WITH A SATELLITE SUBSCRIPTION FOR A 2015 THAT IS UNHEARD OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY POOR 
MY NAVIGATION IS ONLY THRU ONSTAR/ SHOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT SYSTEM
MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT GIVE VOICE INSTRUCTIONS I NEED TO USE MY GARMIN GPS FOR THIS 
MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS NOT WORKED THAT IS WHY I GAVE THE LOW MARKS 
MY NEW IPHONE DOESN T FIT INTO THE EXPENSIVE PHONE JACKET I BOUGHT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO I M NOT SURE HOW TO CONNECT MY PHONE TO THE CAR S ANTENNA NOW OR IF I CAN THAT COULD BE BETTER EXPLAINED AS COULD WHETHER BMW WITH BE OFFERING A PHONE JACK 
MY NEW VAN DOES NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH I THINK ALL VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY THIS IS THE ONLY ASPECT OF MY NEW VAN I DO NOT LIKE WE TRADED IN A 2014 MALIBU LS THAT HAD BLUETOOTH AND IT WAS A BASE MODEL CAR 
MY NEXT SOUL I WILL GET UP GRADED SYSTEM !I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT ON THIS ONE BUT DEALER WOULDNT SWITCH THOSE FRICKIN ULGY GARBAGECAN LID WHEELS 
MY NOB BROKE OF MY STEREO IN LESS THEN 330 DAYS
MY ODYSSEY HAS A REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM AND I HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO LEARN HOW TO SWITCH FROM FRONT SYSTEM USE TO REAR SYSTEM USE AND THE USE OF THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY MY CHILDREN HOWEVER HAVE MASTERED THIS TASK 
MY ONLY COMMENT IS THAT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO GIVE YOU ENOUGH ADVANCE WARNING ABOUT AN UPCOMING TURN OR EXIT 
MY ONLY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE VEHICLE IS THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE THE REVERSE CAMERA IS A MUST HAVE 
MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS AROUND THE VOICE RECOGNITION I CAN T SEEM TO GET THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO UNDERSTAND MY VOICE OR THE VOICE OF ANYONE SITTING IN MY CAR IT S COMPLETELY USELESS TO ME 
MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE NAVIGATION WHILE DRIVING AND THE SCREEN IS TO SMALL 
MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT WITH THE REAR HEADRESTS UP IT IS HARD TO SEE ONCOMING TRAFFIC OUT THE SIDE WINDOW
MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE NAVIGATION IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR SOMEONE WHO IS NOT PARTICULARY COMPUTER SAVY I M HAVIG A VERY DIFFICULT TIME LEARNING IT VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN SO I M ONLY USIG TH VOICE PORTION 
MY ONLY COMPLAINT WITH THIS CAR AND REALLY WITH ANY CAR IS THAT AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR THERE IS NO WAY TO GET RID OF THE STRAIGHT ON SUN GLARE THAT HAMPERS SAFE DRIVING 
MY ONLY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SYSTEMS ARE THAT THE MANUAL VOLUME CONTROL IS TOO SMALL AND A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO USE THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS MAKE UP FOR IT THOUGH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE CALIBRATED BUT I CAN T FIND A WAY TO DO SO 
MY ONLY CRITICISM IS THE VOICE COMMAND FOR THE GPS CAN BE FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES IT MISSES WHAT I AM SAYING YET I WILL SAY THE SAME THING INTO SIRI ON THE IPHONE AND SHE GETS IT 
MY ONLY DIFFICULTY SEEING OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS WHEN I USE THE POWER SCREEN TO BLOCK THE SUNLIGHT FROM COMING IN THROUGH THE REAR WIDOW IT MAKES VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW 
MY ONLY ISSUE IS VISIBILITY ON PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES 
MY ONLY MAJOR CRITICISM OF THE X1 IS THE SMALL REAR VIEW WINDOW ON THE LIFT BACK IT REALLY SHOULD BE LARGER GIVE THE SMALL SIZE OF THE REAR QUARTER WINDOWS WITH THE HOFMEISTER KINK 
MY ONLY NEGATIVE IS THAT I AM TOLD THAT MY BLUETOOTH SOUND IS NOT AS GOOD AS ON MY PREVIOUS BUICK IT APPARENTLY IS NOT A CLEAR VOICE THEY ARE HEARING SAY IT SOUNDS LIKE I AM UNDER WATER!
MY ONLY OBSERVATION IS THAT THERE IS A SEVERE DEMARCATION ON THE TOP BEAMS WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT IT GOES FROM LIGHT TO DARK IT S STARK HAD NOT NOTICED UNTIL A FRIEND POINTED IT OUT 
MY ONLY PROBLEMS ARE 1 THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK EVERY TIME AND NEEDS TO BE TURNED OFF AND ON AGAIN 2 NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT ALWAYS TAKE THE FASTEST ROUTE
MY ONLY QUESTION FOR LEXUS IS WHY DID THEY MAKE THE GLOVEBOX DESIGN SO UNFUNCTIONAL 
MY ONLY SAFETY FACTOR IS THAT AFTER APPLYIJG BRAKE AND STOPPING AND TTAKING FOOT OFF BRAKES AND TURNING OFF ENGINE IT WILL EITHER GO FORWARD OR BACKWARDS AN INCH OR TWO 
MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS BETTER MAPPING FOR THE NAVI SYSTEM TO ENGAGE WITH OCCASIONALLY WE HAVE BEEN STEERED WRONG AT COMPLEX INTERSECTIONS DISCONCERTING BUT THANKFULLY RARE 
MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS WHEN I AM DRIVING ON A CURVY ROAD THAT IT IS SOMETIMES HARD TO SEE ANOTHER CAR COMING AROUND THE CORNER THE BAR ON THE SIDES OF THE WINDSHIELD IS THICKER AND WONDER IF IT WOULD BE EASIER TO SEE IF IT WAS SLIMMER I ALSO U 
MY ONLY WORRY IS THE DANGER OF THE BATTERY IN AN ACCIDENT 
MY OTHER VEHICLE IS A 2004 DODGE RAM 1500 WITH TOWING MIRRORS I WISH EVERY OTHER CAR I HAVE OWNED INCLUDING THIS NEW VAN HAD LARGE MIRRORS LIKE MY TRUCK DOES 
MY OVERALL CONFIDENCE IN DRIVING MY LEGACY IS AMAZING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DRIVING THE CAR EVERY DAY THE ONLY THING IN WHICH I FEEL SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED IS THE LOCATION OF THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR INDICATOR IN THE AUTO DIMMING MIRROR EQUIPPED C 
MY PARTICULAR MODEL HAS AN UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM THAT I PAID MORE FOR AND SUPPOSEDLY FEATURES INFINITY SPEAKERS PAST VEHICLES THAT I HAVE HAD WITH THIS AUDIO SYSTEM HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IN THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE THE BASE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FAR S 
MY PASSAT DID NOT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT THE PHONE INTEGRATION AND ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM ARE EXCELLENT 
MY PASSENGER USED THE SEARCH FEATURE ON A RECENT ROAD TRIP TO FIND HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS GOT THE TELEPHONE NUMBER AND WE USED THE DIAL PAD ON THE PHONE APP TO CALL I COULD NOT USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO ACCEPT THE PHONE NUMBER WE WERE ABLE TO 
MY PATHFINDER DOES NOT HAVE NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION FEATURES 
MY PHONE AND RADIO
MY PHONE CONNECTS WITH THE HIGHLANDER UPON ENTRY TO THE VEHICLE VIA BLUETOOTH INCOMING CALLS ARE CONNECTED THROUGH THE HANDS FREE SYSTEM BUT THE OPTION EXISTS TO USE THE HANDSET IN THE SITUATION OF PASSENGERS OR SENSITIVE CALLS THE CONTROLS ON T 
MY PHONE DOESN T RE CONNECT TO THE CAR BLUE TOOTH AUTOMATICALLY EVEN AFTER WE VE PAIRED IT MANY TIMES BEFORE THE CONNECTION PROCEDURE TAKES SO MANY STEPS THAT MY WHOLE FAMILY DECIDED NOT TO USE IT AT ALL VERY CUMBERSOME AND ANNOYING 
MY PHONE IS EASIER TO USE TO NAVIGATE THAN GETTING HELP FROM THE CAR NAV
MY PHONE IS SUPERIOR AND EASIER TO USE FOR ALL FUNCTIONS AUDIO AND NAVIGATION 
MY PHONE S AUDIO DOES NOT CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH FROM TIME TO TIME IT S ANNOYING WHEN IT DOESN T AS THERE S NO REAL REASON WHY IT DOESN T CONNECT ABOUT 75% OF THE TIME 
MY PHONE WON T SYNC PROPERLY WITH THE SYSTEM IT S BECAUSE IT S AN IPHONE AND HONDA/ACURA WON T PAY APPLE FOR LICENSING IT HAS RUINED THE CAR FOR ME 
MY PILOT DOES NOT HAVE A WARNING SYSTEM OR ALERT DEALING WITH THE BLINDSPOT IF IT HAD THAT I WOULD HAVE RATED THIS A 10 
MY PORSCHE HAS TOUCH SCREEN ON ITS NAV/ENTERTAINMENT SYSTMEAND IS THEREFORE MUCH EASIER TO USE 
MY PREFERENCE WOULD HAVE HAD A CD PLAYER BUT THE OVERALL OF IT ALL THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS GREAT
MY PREVIOUS CAR WAS LEXUS GS AND THE SOUND SYSTEM WAS FAR SUPERIOR 
MY PREVIOUS EX MODEL HAD INFINITY SOUND SYSTEM STANDARD IN THE PACKAGE I BOUGHT THE NEW EX DOES NOT YOU HAVE TO BUY THE NEXT MODEL UP 
MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE HAD A DUAL SUN VISOR SYSTEM THE MAIN VISOR COULD BE ADJUSTED TO THE SIDE WINDOW AND A SMALLER VISOR COULD BE TURNED DOWN FOR SUN PROTECTION AT THE WINDSHIELD THIS VEHICLE HAS ONLY A SINGLE VISOR SYSTEM THE DUAL VISOR SYSTEM 
MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE HAD A MOUSE THAT I COULD USE TO TURN TO FAVORITE PHONE NUMBERS I DON T REALLY USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE HOW IT WORKS I FIND MYSELF TAKING MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO USE THE NAVIGATION SCREEN TO MAK 
MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE HAD AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT MY FIESTA I FOUND MYSELF DRIVING IN THE DARK MY FAULT BECAUSE I WASN T USE TO HAVING TO MANUALLY TURN THEM ON AGAIN I KNOW THE FIESTA IS AN INEXPENSIVE COMPACT BUT INCLUDING 
MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE NOT A JETTA WAS MORE FRIENDLY AND UNDERSTOOD COMMANDS BETTER 
MY PRIOR AUDI HAD MANY OF THE SAME SAFETY AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURES I WAS IN A BAD ACCIDENT AND FEEL CERTAIN OF THOSE FEATURES PROTECTED ME FROM SEVERE INJURY THE CAR S ADVANCED COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS HAVE HELPED ME AVOID ACCIDENTS 
MY PRIOR CAR CHEVY CRUZ HAD A MUCH BETTER FEEL AND COLOR SCHEME THE BLUETOOTH AND CONNECTING WAS MUCH BETTER I PREFER THE TIGUAN ALL AROUND BUT THE AUDIO SYSTEM AND TOUCH SCREEN SEEMS A LITTLE BEHIND THE TIMES 
MY PRIOR VEHICLE HAD THE COMPASS ON THE MIRROR I FIND THE MICKY MOUSE ARROW ON THE SCREEN WHICH SUPPOSEDLY IS A COMPASS OF NO USE WHATSOEVER 
MY PROBLEM IS WITH THE PANEL THAT SEPARATES THE THE FRONT WINDSHIELD & SIDE WINDOWS
MY PROBLEM WITH THE VISIBILITY IS PARTICULARLY WITH BEING ABLE TO SEE OUR OF THE PASS REAR WINDOW BECAUSE OF THE HIGH HEAD REST ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE SEAT I AM ONLY 5 FEET TALL AND MY HUSBAND IS 6 4 SO WHEN HE SITS IN THE PASS SIDE SEAT H 
MY PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN WITH CONNECTIVITY VIA BLUETOOTH SPECIFICALLY WHEN TWO PEOPLE ARE IN THE CAR MY WIFE AND I BOTH HAVE OUR PHONES CONNECTED TO THE CAR YET WHEN I ATTEMPT TO STREAM YOUTUBE OR PANDORA TO THE BLUETOOTH SOURCE THE CAR AUTOMATIC 
MY RATING TELLS THE STORY
MY RATING WAS INFLUENCED BY THE ONE TIME FAILURE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
MY RC IS THE THIRD LEXUS THAT CAME WITH MOUSE AND IT S NOT EASY TO USE TOUCH SCREEN WAS A LOT BETTER I WAS HOPING LEXUS HAVE IMPROVED THE MOUSE BUT HASN T QUITE YET MOUSE PAD IS A LITTLE BETTER TO USE THAN STICK IN MY 2014 RX BUT STILL NEE 
MY RDX DOES NOT HAVE FOR THIS ITEMS
MY RELATIVELY LOWER SCORES FOR SIDE AND FORWARD VISIBILITY STEM FROM TWO FACTORS 1 I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO THE GREENHOUSE VISIBILITY OF A SUV FOR MANY YEARS BEFORE THIS CAR SO I AM WARY OF THE LARGER SIDE BLINDSPOTS NOW AND 2 BEING VERY TALL I 
MY ROGUE HAS THE BOSE SYSTEM WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN UPGRADE FROM THE STANDARD SOUND SYSTEM HOWEVER I DON T REALLY NOTICE ANY DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE FROM MY ALTIMA S STANDARD SYSTEM THIS HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT 
MY RR HSE IS A PERFECT 10 !!!!!
MY SATELLITE RADIO IS AFTERMARKET BECAUSE IT IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM FACTORY OR DEALER
MY SCORES MAY BE LOWER BECAUSE I DO NOT USE ALL OF THE FEATURES AVAILABLE 
MY SCREEN DID NOT SHOW ME A 10 SO SOME OF MY ANSWER WOULD HAVE RATED A 10 
MY SCREEN FREEZES WHEN TEMPERATURE EXCEEDS 80 DEGREES THIS IS A SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE THE APPS SCREEN OFTEN DOES NOT FUNCTION EVEN WHEN I HAVE NOT ALTERED THE ENTUNE ON MY PHONE MY OLD BUICK ENCORE WAS NOT DEPENDENT ON AN APP LINE ENTUNE OR 
MY SIGHT IS SOMETIME BLOCKED BY THE SIDE MIRRORS DESPITE ADJUSTING THE SEATS TO A HIGHER LEVEL

MY SON IS SPECIAL NEEDS AND LOVES LISTENING TO ONE SONG AT A TIME OVER AND OVER AGAIN I CAN EASILY REPLAY THIS SONG FOR HIM AFTER IT HAS FINISHED USING ONE CLICK OF A BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL HIS HAPPINESS MAKE MY DRIVE MORE RELAXING 
MY SON ROLLED HIS PREVIOUS 2006 HYUNDAI ACCENT 3 TIMES WHILE DRIVING A YEAR AGO ALTHOUGH THE AIRBAGS WERE NOT DEPLOYED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DIRECT IMPACT MY SON SUFFERED ONLY A COUPLE OF SCRATCHES ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS TOTALED THE SEATBEL 
MY SON S NEW CIVIC HAD A CAMERA VIEW FOR TURNING RIGHT OUR CAR COST $20 000 MORE AND DOES NOT DISAPPOINTED THAT MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE THAT FEATURE 
MY SPARK IS BASIC AND LACKS THE NICE RADIO UPGRADES I WISH WIFI WAS MADE STANDARD THE LIGHTS THAT COME ON WHEN YOU UNLOCK THE CAR DOOR ARE GREAT I FEEL LIKE MY CAR GREATS ME AFTER A LONG NIGHT OUT 
MY SPEAKER IS THIS BIG BOX IN MY TRUNK AND TAKES UP TOO MUCH SPACE THEY NEED TO BE SMALLER MAKE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MORE USER FRIENDLY 
MY SYSTEM IS AS BASIC AS IT GETS AND DISAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF UP TO DATE OPTIONS THAT MY 2011 HAD 
MY TECNICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE BMW650I IS LIMITED I PERSONALLY NEED TO LEARN TO USE IT OR GO GET LESSIONS THE CAR HAS MORE TO OFFER THAN I KNOW HOW TO USE IT S UP TO ME TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT THE CAR IS AMAZING ON WHAT IT OFFERS

MY UCONNECT WILL NOT WORK AT ALL
MY UNDERSTANDING OF NAV SYSTEM GETTING AN ADDRESS FROM POI OR INTO ADDRESS BOOK ALSO THE NAV SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM FLEXIBLE ON DIFFERENT ROUTES THIS MAY BE MORE OF A USER PROBLEM I NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THE OWNERS MANUAL IT S HARD TO U 
MY UPGRADED STEREO
MY VAN DOES NOT HAVE POWER MIRRORS THESE SHOULD BE MADE MANDATORY THE SIDE MIRRORS REQUIRE YOU TO BE EXTREMELY ALERT ON FOUR LANES BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE BLID SPOT WHEN A CAR IS COMING UP ON THE LEFT SIDE

MY VEHICLE HAS THE WINDOW RAIN GUARDS THEY ARE HORRIBLE AS THEY ARE BLIND SPOTS YOU REALLY NEED TO MOVE AROUND A LOT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE CLEAR TO PROCEED I MAY HAVE THEM REMOVED THEY WERE AN EXTRA FEATURE ON THE VEHICLE THAT IT CAME WITH 
MY VEHICLE IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND I ENJOY THE MUSIC QUALITY 
MY VISIBILITY ISSUES ARE BECAUSE I M SHORT 4 11 
MY VISIBILITY ISSUES ARE SKEWED BECAUSE I AM UNDER 5 FT TALL
MY VISIBILITY ISSUES MAY BE BECAUSE I AM TALL AND THE CONVERTIBLE TOP PLACEMENT AND MY HEIGHT DO NOT COINCIDE HOWEVER I DON T MIND AT ALL SINCE IT FORCES ME TO BE EVEN MORE CAUTIOUS WHEN CLEARING BLIND SPOTS AND CHANGING LANES AS FAR AS THE VIS 
MY VISIBILITY ISSUES RELATE TO MY SMALL STATURE AT 4 8 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OVER THE HOOD I HAD TO ADD PEDAL EXTENDERS TO GET FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE AIRBAG I WOULD LIKE TO SIT HIGHER IN THE SEAT BUT HAVE NO WAY TO DO SO

NAV SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW BUT FUNCTIONAL I MIGHT USE IT FOR LONGER TRIPS BUT I GENERALLY RELY ON MY PHONE FOR MY NAVIGATION NEEDS 
NAV SYSTEM IS VERY USER FRIENDLY 
NAV SYSTEM IS WORST I HAVE HAD LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED ZOOM FEATURE IS VERY POORLY DESIGNED TOO MUCH OF THE SCREEN IS TAKEN UP BY FEATURES THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO THE MAP HARD TO READ STREET NAMES UNLESS YOUR ARE ZOOMED TO THE PERFECT SE 
NAV SYSTEM KIND OF A PAIN TO ENTER LOCATIONS NEW SYSTEM FOR ME THOUGH I WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH OLD TRUCK SO THIS MIGHT BE A ME FAULT 
NAV SYSTEM LACKS A SENSE OF LOCATION IN REFERENCE TO ALL ROADS
NAV SYSTEM LOCKED OUT WHILE MOVING
NAV SYSTEM LOCKS SO PASSENGER CAN NOT CONTROL WHEN MOVING WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE PASSENGER FEATURE TO ALLOW CONTROL IF PASSENGER IS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT GRAPHICS OF THE MAP SYSTEM ARE PRETTY DATED WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE CLEAN DISPLAY GRAPHICS H 
NAV SYSTEM MAKES SOME STANGE ROUTES SOMETIMES THIS MAY HAVE BEEN CORRECTED BY A NAV UPDATE THAT CAME OUT JUST WEEKS AFTER I GOT MY CAR I M NOT PAYING FOR THE UPDATE ALSO THE AUDIO DOES NOT SOUND NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE BASE STEREO IN MY 07 BMW 
NAV SYSTEM MOST SIMILAR VEHICLES EG ACURA LEXUS ETC ALLOW NAVIGATION TO RESTAURANTS BUSINESSES ETC BY PHONE NUMBER BMW ALONE DOES NOT HAVE THIS OPTION A GRAVE DEFICIENCY I HAVE COMMUNICATED THIS TO BMW FREQUENTLY TO NO AVAIL OR EVEN RESPONSE!
NAV SYSTEM NEEDS TO ASK WHAT STATE WHAT CITY STREET AND HOUSE NUMBER 
NAV SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE EASIER TO USE

NAV SYSTEM SCREEN NOT EASILY VISIBLE FROM DRIVER S SEAT TILTABLE DISABLE WOULD BE BETTER NO TRAFFIC SYSTEM INCLUDED WITH NAV SYSTEM UNACCEPTABLE ROUTE DISPLAY COULD BE LARGER LARGER STREET NAMES WOULD BE BETTER WHEN LANE DISPLAY APPEARS 
NAV SYSTEM SHOULD GIVE STREET BY STREET TURNS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE STREET OR ROAD I AM ON 
NAV SYSTEM SHOULD GIVE US AN EARLIER DIRECTION WHEN MULTIPLE FREEWAYS ARE AHEAD INPUT ONE ADDRESS AND LOOKS LIKE THE SYSTEM ACCEPTED IT ONLY TO CHANGE THE ADDRESS NUMBER AND TOOK US TO A LATTER DESTINATION BROUGHT IT TO A BMW SERVICE REP AND SH 
NAV SYSTEM SLOW WE RE STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE
NAV SYSTEM SOMETIMES DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO PUT IN ADDRESS OR CAN T FIND A VALID ADDRESS NEED TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE WHEN DRIVING PASSENGER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO USE IT

NAV SYSTEM SOMETIMES NOT VERY RESPONSIVE TO VOICE COMMANDS 
NAV SYSTEM TOO COMPLEX
NAV SYSTEM VERY AVERAGE MAP AVERAGE TURNING BELL VERY GOOD
NAV SYSTEM VOICE COMMAND INTERPRETATION OF MY VOICE IS VERY POOR ALMOST NEVER CORRECT EVEN THOUGH I USED THE INSTALLED VOICE TRAINING APP 
NAV SYSTEM VOICE RECOGNITION HAS DIFFICULTY IN ACCEPTING ADDRESSES STREET NAMES AND CITIES IT GENERALLY REQUIRES SEVERAL ATTEMPTS BEFORE IT GETS IT RIGHT ALSO IT CONTINUES TO REQUIRE STREET NUMBERS AND NAMES WHEN ALL I WANT IS A ROUTE TO A CITY 
NAV SYSTEM WHEN USING THE MAP I LIKE TO ZOOM OUT SO I CAN SEE THE TRAFFIC WHERE I AM GOING THE ZOOM OUT ONLY LASTS A FEW SECONDS THEN IT IS BACK TO WHERE IT STARTED FROM I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HAVE A WEATHER MAP WITH WARNINGS AND OR RADAR AS

NAV TOUCH SCREEN
NAV VERY EASY TO USE CENTER DISPLAY BETWEEN TACH AND SPEEDO VERY CLEAR AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND
NAV VOICE COMMAND
NAV VOICE CONTROL CAN BE CONFUSING NOT TOO INTUITIVE
NAV/COMM/PHONE SYSTEM
NAVAGATION DOES NOT GIVE U OPITIONS AS TO ADDRESS CITY AND STATE WHAT EVER IT THINKS U SAID IT DOESNOT GIVE U OPITIONS AND AT THAT PT U HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN OR SOMETIMES MULTIPLY TIMES TO GET DIRECTIONS IT TAKES TO MUCH OF A PERSONS TIME
NAVAGATION POI OUTDATED
NAVAGATION SCREEN HARD TO READ WHEN SUN IS SHINNING ON IT 
NAVAGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO SCROLL AROUND IF YOU TOUCH THE SCREEN IT TAKES IT TO AN ADDRESS ALMOST ALL THE TIME YOU THEN HAVE TO CLEAR OUT THAT POINT 
NAVAGATION TO GIVE STREET NAMES RATHER THAN SAYING TURNING IN SO MANY FEET ALSO DOESN T GIVE ENOUGH TIME WHEN NEEDING TO TURN MISS THE TURN SOMETIMES
NAVAGATION VOICE RECOGNITION
NAVAGATION VOICE RECOGNITION OF ADDRESS DOES NOT WORK WELL NEED TO INPUT NAVAGATION DATA MANUALLY BEFORE DRIVING
NAVAGATION VOLUME IN CONJUNCTION WITH RADIO PLAYING

NAVI IS ACCURATE AND INFORMATIVE
NAVI IS DIFFICULT TO LOAD TAGGED DESTINATIONS
NAVI IS NOT CONNECTING TO MY IPHONE ADDRESS BOOK AND WHEN I MANUALLY KEY IN ADDRESS IT TENDS TO BE OFF ON LOCATION 
NAVI MUCH IMPROVED OVER OUR 2011 MODEL!
NAVI NEEDS ALOT OF WORK
NAVI NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO TYPE FULL DESTINATION WITHOUT COMPOSING A LIST OF POSSIBLE NAVI NEEDS TO LET YOU PLUG IN THE DESIRED ROUTE VS SHORTEST DISTANCE AND LESD TIME
NAVI SYSTEM SHOULD BE PROGRAMED WITH WAZE FOR ACCURATE TRAFFIC UPDATES AND ROUTING JOYSTICK CONTROLS ARE NOT GREAT DIFFICULT TO GET RADIO TO APPEAR ON SCREEN
NAVI SYSTEM WORKS WELL BUT WE DROVE THE CAR FROM CHICAGO TO MIAMI AND BACK AND FOUND THE TRAFFIC REPORTING WAS USELESS AND WE DIDN T EVEN TRY TO USE IT AFTER THE FIRST 3 DAYS ON THE ROAD THE WEATHER REPORTING WASN T THAT GREAT EITHER A FEW TIMES 
NAVIAGATION NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

NAVIGATING PHONEBOOK COULD BE EASIER 
NAVIGATING RADIO STATIONS IS TRULY ARCHAIC SO MUCH ROOM ON THE 8 DISPLAY SO LITTLE INFO/NAVIGABILITY [SEE FORD/LINCOLN MYTOUCH SYSTEM FOR GUIDE TO IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT ] M B OPERATION SEEMS TO OPERATING DOS WHEREAS AN IPHONE LIKE IOS WOULD BE 
NAVIGATING THE MENUS VOICE COMMANDS NEED TO IMPROVE
NAVIGATING THE NAVIGATION SCREEN COULD BE MORE RESPONSIVE AND USER FRIENDLY 
NAVIGATING THE SOUND CHANNELS AND GPS NAV FEATURES IS TOO COMPLEX

NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO OPERATE

NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOMETIMES DOES NOT ALLOW FOR INPUT OF ACTUAL STREET ADDRESS IT WILL FORCE YOU TO SELECT A RANGE OF # S E G 3000 3700 NW ABBOTT STREET AND TOTALLY GETS LOST MORE THAN ONCE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOMETIMES PROVIDES ROUTES THAT IGNORE LOGIC SUCH AS ROUTING THRU RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD THAN MAIN STREETS EVEN WHEN SET AT FASTEST MODE 
NAVIGATION SYSTEM STINKS SEE PREVIOUS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM TAKE A LONG TIME TO START UP ONCE THE CAR IS STARTED WHILE IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ANY OTHER SYSTEM CHANGE CHANGING VOLUME ON MUSIC UPLOADING CONTACTS VIA BLUETOOTH ETC COVERS UP THE SPACE WHERE THE NEXT DIRECTION INSTRUC 
NAVIGATION SYSTEM TAKES TOO LONG TO START UP AFTER YOU START THE CAR OTHER THAN THAT I LIKE IT 
NAVIGATION SYSTEM TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE AT THE DESIGNATION FAR BEFORE YOU GET THERE AND THEN JUST QUITS IF YOU PASS THE DESTINATION THE ADDRESS HAS TO BE REENTERED VERY IRRITATING READY TO JUST USE MY GARMIN VOICE RECOGNITION SELDOM WORKS TO 
NAVIGATION SYSTEM TENDS TO BE ON POINT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE AUDIO IS GREAT BUT THE GPS IS SECOND RATE

NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE EASIER TO USE WITH AN INTERFACE MORE LIKE GARMAN S INCLUDING TOUCHSCREEN 
NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE MUCH MORE USABLE IF IT WORKED WHEN VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION ITS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE PASSENGER CAN PROGRAM IT I FIND IT MORE DANGEROUS TO PULL OVER 
NAVIGATION SYSTEM/SCREEN IS PLACED TOO LOW IT CAUSES A DISTRACTION TO HAVE TO LOOK DOWN ALSO ANGLE OF THE SCREEN IS SUCH THAT WITH THE MOONROOF OPEN THE SUN CAN MAKE THE SCREEN HARD TO SEE

NAVIGATION THROUGH MUSIC LIBRARY COULD BE IMPROVED IF I NAVIGATE TO A FOLDER SELECT A SONG TO LISTEN TO THERE IS NOT AN EASY WAY TO GO BACK FROM THE SONG TO THE FOLDER IT WAS PLAYED IN BE IT AN ACTUAL FOLDER OR A SUB CATEGORY LIKE ALBUM OR AR 
NAVIGATION THROUGH VOICE COMMAND SHOULD BE EASIER ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING VOICE COMMANDS ARE INCONSISTENT WHEN DRIVING MISSED TURN ONCE

OCCASIONAL LAG IN THE NAVIGATION WHEN MOVING FROM ITEM TO ITEM AND LOADING DIFFERENT SCREENS

OCCASIONALLY DURING COLD AND ICY WEATHER THE FRONT WIPERS GET FROZEN AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO CLEAR THE FRONT MIRROR

OF ALL THE CARS I HAVE OWNED OR TEST DRIVEN I FEEL THAT THE VISIBILITY REAR AND SIDE OF THE IMPREZA IS FAR SUPERIOR THOUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS RIGHT IN MY LINE OF SIGHT I DID GET USED TO IT QUICKLY AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM 
OF COURSE IT IS A TRUCK SO VISIBILITY TO THE REAR WILL BE LIMITED

ON / OFF BUTTON FOR RADIO ON THE STEERING WHEEL 
ON 90 DEGREE TURNS TURNING CORNERS MIRRORS AND FORWARD WINDOW POST TEND TO OBSTRUCT VISION
ON BALANCE VERY GOOD
ON BOARD CAMERA
ON DEMAND 4 WHEEL DRIVE
ON HIGH BEAMS THE HEADLIGHTS ARE WONDERFUL ON LOW BEAMS IT IS HARDER TO SEE FAR AWAY ABOVE THE LINE
ON ICY ROADS IT IS NOT AS STABLE AS I WOULD LIKE 
ON JAN 26 2015 I TRADED IN A 2012 DODGE JOURNEY FOR A 2015 JOURNEY GREAT CAR FOR THE PRICE JUST A TRADE UP 21 DAYS LATER I WAS IN A HORRIFIC CAR ACCIDENT T BONED I WALKED AWAY FROM THAT ACCIDENT AFTER THEY USED THE JAWS TO GET ME OUT JUS 
ON LEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR I ATTACHED ADDITIONAL LITTLE MIRROR TO WATCH NON VISIBLE SPOTS 
ON LOW BEAM THE LIGHT CUTS OFF VERY SHARPLY I WISH IT WERE A LITTLE MORE GRADUAL 
ON MY 2012 EQUINOX THERE WAS A BLIND SPOT SMALL MIRROR ON REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT YOU HAVE NOT PUT ON THIS 2015 MODEL I MISS THAT VERY MUCH!
ON MY PREVIOUS KIA 2011 SPORTAGE I HAD TO REPLACE THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER THREE TIMES I HAD THE VEHICLE FOR A LITTE MORE THAN 3 YEARS
ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON THE CAR IS HARD TO TYPE THE LETTER ON ADDRESS OR NUMBER ON SCREEN COMPARE TO G P S THAT LET ME DO SO EASY AND MORE QUICKLY 
ON ONE HAND I LIKE THE REAR MIRRORS DIMMING AT NIGHT BUT ALSO REDUCES VISIBILITY I WISH THEY INCLUDED PASSING WARNING LIGHT TO ASSIST WITH THIS FEATURE 
ON OUR PREVIOUS 2005 PRIUS WE USED A SEPARATE NAVIGRATION SYSTEM SINCE IT WAS NOT BUILT INTO THE CAR I DO NOT THINK THAT BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEMS WERE AVAILABLE 10 YEARS AGO WE DO NOT LIKE THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON OUR NEW PRIUS V A 
ON PLAYING OFF MUSIC THRU USB FLASHDRIVE ONLY FEATURE I WISH HAD WAS ABLE TO SEE THE FOLDERS SO I COULD PLAY THE MUSIC FROM FOLDER I SAVED IN 
ON REAR MIRROR ON THE DRIVER SITE IT BLOCKS VIEW IF THE DRIVER IS TOO SHORT LIKE 5 2 
ON RIGHT HAND TURNS NO SIDE LIGHTS/SIGNALS WHEN TURNING TIGHT TURNS MAKES IT HARD TO KNOW IF I AM CUTTING TOO SHORT
ON SAFETY I FEEL VERY MUCH IN CONTROL TO AVOID ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF EXCELLENT VISIBILITY 
ON SAFETY ISSUE WISH CAR DOORS WOULD LOCK UPON STARTING IGNITION OR PUTTING THE CAR IN GEAR WISH I COULD LOCK DOORS FROM THE INTERIOR WHEN EXITING INSTEAD OF USING THE REMOTE CLICKER 
ON SAT IS A RIPOFF BRAKES ARE SO BAD IN WINTER I WAS LIED TO BY DEALER RE BRAKES WANTED ROOF RACKS WAS TOLD NOT AVAILABLE
ON SCREEN PLACEMENT
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE ON STAR SEEMS CONFUSED AND DOESN T RESPOND TO COMMANDS
ON STAR
ON STAR DIDN T WORK FROM DAY ONE EVEN THOUGH THE DEALERSHIP SET IT UP AND SAID IT WORKED FOUND THIS OUT WHEN I TRIED TO USE THE REMOTE DOOR UNLOCK FEATURE AND THEY COULDN T DO IT PART NEEDED TO BE REPLACED BY THE DEALER DIDN T REALLY GET TO 
ON STAR DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT VERY COMPLICATED 
ON STAR DOESN T APPEAR TO HAVE A MAP FEATURE JUST TURN BY TURN MESSAGES
ON STAR DOESN T SHOW YOU THE ROUTE OVER VIEW AND DOESN T OFFER MULTIPLE ROUTE TO CHOOSE FROM
ON STAR FEATURE AND THE EASE OF INPUTTING DIRECTIONS FROM PHONE AUTO BLUETOOTH CONNECT WITH BUILT IN SAFETY STANDARDS
ON STAR IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR BUYING A GM CAR 
ON STAR IS THE BEST NAVAGATION SYSTEM GOING THE OTHER THING IS EVERYTHING IS EASY TO USE AND WELL THOUGHT OUT FOR DRIVER USE 
ON STAR MODUAL
ON STAR S TURN BY TURN NAVIGATION 
ON STAR SHOULD NOT BE SUBCONTRACTED
ON STAR SYSTEM PRICING IS TOO EXPENSIVE
ON STAR TOO EXPENSIVE SHOULD BE LESS THEN 5 BUCKS A MONTH
ON STAR WI FI DID NOT WORK AND THEY CANNOT FIX POOR SERVICE FROM ON STAR REPS THEY BIORDER ON INCOMPETENT 
ON STEERING WHEEL PHONE CONNECTION
ON SUNNY DAYS THERE IS A GLARE ON THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD FROM THE DASH MATERIAL IT COULD BE DUE TO BAD WINDSHIELD ANGLE BUT IT IS ANNOYING THE FACTORY HEADLIGHTS ARE WORTHLESS ABOUT AS MUCH HELP AS A FLASHLIGHT WITH DEAD BATTERIES 
ON THE 3RD SEATING ON THE SIDE NEEDS AT A ANOTHER CUP HOLDER THERE SHOULD A LESS BE A LIGHT IN THE GLOVER COMPARTMENT ALSO IN THE CENTER CONSOLE THERE SHOLUD BE A LESS SPACE BETWEEN THE CENTER INTERIOR UNDER THE PANEL LIKE YOU HAD IN THE 2012 KIA
ON THE 500C THE EXTRA WIDE ANGLE SIDE MIRROR IS AN ADDED SAFETY FEATURE THAT HAS HELPED BUT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO THE SUN VISORS ARE TOO SMALL 
ON THE CONVERTIBLE I FIND THE CENTER SCREEN TO BE AN OBSTRUCTION FROM SEEING OUT OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IT WOULD BE NICE FOR THE SCREEN TO GO DOWN COMPLETELY 
ON THE DRIVERS SIDE THE FRAME BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOOR PARTIALLY BLOCKS VIEW OF CAR THAT IS IN LANE TO LEFT AND PARALLEL TO REAR OR JUST BEFORE REAR 
ON THE DRIVERS SIDE THERE IS A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT
ON THE MAIN SCREEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LEAVE IT ON THE RADIO PAGE INSTEAD OF IT DEFAULTING TO MAIN PAGE 
ON THE NAV SIDE BE ABLE TO INPUT ONLY TOWN NAMES INSTEAD OF HAVING TO HAVE AN EXACT ADDRESS 
ON THE NAV SYSTEM WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO DESTINATION IT JUST SHOWS STREET NAME VERSUS THE HOUSE OR BUILDING NUMBER SO INSTEAD OF 617 N 63RD THE ROUTING SHOW N 63RD AND OFTEN AT THAT POINT I M TRYING TO FIND THE EXACT LOCATION SO HAVING STREE 
ON THE NAVIGATION I HATE THAT THE ADDRESS DISAPPEARS ONCE YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRIP SO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE SCREEN TO FIND IT ONCE YOU ARRIVE 
ON THE NAVIGATION MAP SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO TELL THE TRAFFIC AHEAD COLORS BLEND IN WITH THE FREEWAY OR MAP BACKGROUND 
ON THE RADIO I LOVE THAT YOU CAN REWIND TO HEAR SOMETHING YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED! WHEN YOU REWIND IT SHOWS YOU HOW MANY SECONDS YOU HAVE DONE SO IF YOU KNOW YOU WANTED TO HEAR SOMETHING THAT WAS SAID 15 SECONDS AGO YOU BACK IT UP THAT FAR 
ON THE REGULAR TOUCH SCREEN WITHOUT NAVIGATION THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN COULD BE LARGER
ON THE SIDE MIRRORS I DO NOT LIKE THE EXTRA SECTION IN THE UPPER OUTSIDE CORNERS OF THE MIRRORS I DO NOT FIND THEM HELPFUL AND WOULD RATHER HAVE A FULL MIRROR WITHOUT THE EXTRA MAGNIFICATION 
ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THE LITTLE CORNER MIRRORS TEND TO REFLECT SUN IN MY EYES WHEN THE SUN IS BEHIND YOU I AM A 6 4 DRIVER BUT MY WIFE IS 5 6 AND DOES NOT EXPERIENCE THIS ALSO WITH THE 3RD ROW HEAD RESTS WHEN THEY ARE UP IT BLOCKS A LOT 
ON THE SMALL DISPLAY ABOVE THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN YOU HAVE THE LIST OF CALLS YOU HAVE MADE IT SHOWS THE NAME AND HOME/WORK/CELL MY OLD AUDI JUST SHOWED THE NAME SO I WASN T ALWAYS SURE WHICH OF THE PERSON A NUMBERS I HAD CALLED MOST RECENTLY
ON THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
ON THE VOICE IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND SOME COMMANDS 
ON THE WAY HOME FROM THE DEALERSHIP THE DAY WE BOUGHT IT I WAS DRIVING THE VAN AND MY HUSBAND WAS DRIVING OUR OTHER KIA RIGHT BEHIND ME LA S FREEWAYS ARE ALWAYS CHALLENGING BUT ON THIS EVENING A WILD DRIVER WAS WEAVING ACROSS LANES AT ABOUT 100 
ON THIS MODEL THE SMALL WIDE ANGLE MIRROR WAS REMOVED FROM THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR THIS WAS A USEFUL ITEM ON THE 2013 F150 WE OWNED 
ON TRIPS SOMETIMES OUR CELL PHONE HAS SPOTTY RECEPTION THE EQUINOX HANDS FREE PHONE NEVER LOOSES RECEPTION 
ON/OFF BUTTON IS IN A HANDY SPOT 
ON/OFF BUTTON IS TOO SMALL
ON/OFF BUTTON NEEDS A PHYSICAL BUTTON WITH SOME TRAVEL ALSO WOULD PREFER DIAL TO CONTROL VOLUME/MUTE
ONCE AGAIN I CANNOT SEE THE DISPLAY SCREEN NAVIGATION SYSTEM BLUETOOTH WHEN IS FACED BY THE SUN
ONCE AGAIN IT GOES TO THE ANTIQUATED LOOK THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM HAS IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM THE EARLY 90 S WITH THAT SAID IT S VERY EASY TO USE EASY TO LEARN BUT I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE AUDIO SYSTEM A BIT MORE I GOT RID OF A NIS 
ONCE AGAIN IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO HAVE THE TOUCH SCREEN INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE BUTTONS!
ONCE AGAIN THE NAVIGATION IN INSTUMENT CLUSTER IS VERY SAFE TO DRIVE WITH
ONCE AGAIN TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS 
ONCE AGAIN VISIBILITY ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED
ONCE BLUE TOOTH IS CONNECTED IT STAYS CONNECTED EASE OF SWITCHING FROM ONE MEDIUM TO ANOTHER 
ONCE FAMILIAR EASY TO USE WITHOUT TAKING EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME!
ONCE I LEARN HOW TO EFFECTIVELY USE THE SYSTEM I THINK IT WILL BE OUTSTANDING I AM PLEASED WITH THE PERFORMANCE SO FAR 
ONCE I LEARNED HOW TO USE IT I WAS FINE THERE ARE SEVERAL STEPS TO CHANGING STATIONS OR GOING FROM FM TO SATELITE FOR EXAMPLE 
ONCE I READ THE MANUAL IT WAS VERY SIMPLE
ONCE I SET THE RADIO I DON T CHANGEE THE STATION AND I DO NOT USE MY CELL PHONE WHILE DRIVING 
ONCE IN A WHILE THE HEIGHT OF THE PASSENGER HEAD REST OBSTRUCTS MY SIDE VEIW WHEN I M BACKING UP 
ONCE IN A WHILE THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T WORK AND THEN I REALIZE PHONE DIDN T AUTOMATICALLY PAIR WITH CAR 
ONCE IN A WHILE WHEN CHANGING LANES IT TAKES A LITTLE EXTRA EFFORT TO LOOK AROUND AND ESPECIALLY BEHIND TO ENSURE THAT IT IS SAFE TO CHANGE LANES 
ONCE IN AHA OR PANDORA HARD TO CHSNGE THE SOURCE HAVE TO SWITCH OFF DISCONNECT USB CORD NOT SIMPLE
ONCE IN AWHILE I GET A COLLISION WARNING BEEP AND I DON T KNOW WHY 
ONCE INSIDE THE CAR IT FEELS MUCH BIGGER THAN IT LOOKS VERY GOOD 360 VISIBILITY AND HEAD ROOM ENOUGH FOR A TALL PERSON WEARING A HAT 
ONCE LEARNED IT SEEMS EASY TO USE 
ONCE LEARNED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS EASY AND CONVENIENT 
ONCE ONE LEARNS HOW IT WORKS IT S EXCEPTIONAL NOT AN EASY LEARNING CURVE MOSTLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY FEATURES AND OPTIONS TO LEARN ABOUT 
ONCE PHONE APPS ARE LOADED THE PHONE IS NOT REQUIRED TO OPERATE THEM WHEN THE IPHONE RINGS OR GETS A TEXT MESSAGE THE PHONE APP RUNNING IN THE CAR SHUTS OFF AND HAS TO BE HAND RESTARTED TO GET BACK ON INTERNET RADIO FOR EXAMPLE 
ONCE REPLACED WITH AFTERMARKET OUTSTANDING 8 
ONCE THE DESTINATION IS INPUT THE GUIDANCE IS VERY GOOD 
ONCE THE SALES ASSOCIATE HELPED ME IT IS REALLY EASY TO PRE PROGRAM MY FAVORITE STATIONS SO I CAN CHANGE THEM ON THE STEERING WHEEL 
ONCE THE SEAT IS RAISED YOU HAVE TO STOP FURTHER BACK FROM A STOP LIGHT TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE LIGHT WINDSHIELD NEEDED TO BE EXTENDED FURTHER 
ONCE YOU ARE FINISHED UTILIZING NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF IT AND GO TO ANOTHER ENTERTAINMENT FEATURE
ONCE YOU GET THE HANG OF IT EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO IS RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF YOU 2 THINGS 1 WISH THE SCREEN DIDN T RETAIN FINGERPRINTS AND 2 COULD THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BE EASIER FOR VOICE COMMANDS AND IN FINDING LOCAL POINTS OF INTEREST?
ONCE YOU HAVE A LOCATION IN THE GPS IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND THE TURN LIST ALTERNATE ROUTE ETC ALSO NOT EASY TO CANCEL A LOCATION ONCE IT IS IN WHILE DRIVING 
ONCE YOU LEARN THE COMMANDS IT S VERY EASY TO USE
ONCE YOU LEARN TO USE ALL OF THE SENSORS AND THE AUTOMATIC BREAKING THEY ARE GREAT ADDITIONS TO DRIVING SAFELY
ONE
ONE COMPLAINT IS THE WIPERS AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID DELIVERY IN BAD WEATHER WHEN IT IS ICY THEY FREEZE UP VERY EASILY AND DON T WORK MUCH WORSE THAN MY SEDAN NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
ONE FEATURE I AM TRULY HAPPY WITH IS THE WIDE WINDOWS AND THE ABILITY TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD 
ONE FEATURE THAT WOULD BE USEFUL IS THE ABILITY TO MOVE BETWEEN MODES IN ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM EG SATELLITE RADIO CD FM BLUETOOTH AM ETC ON THE STEERING WHEEL YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD TO PUSH THE SOURCE BUTTON THEN PU 
ONE FEATURE WE DON T HAVE IS THE SEAT MEMORY IF THAT FEATURE HAD SIDE MIRROR MEMORY AS WELL IT WOULD BE EVEN BETTER 
ONE IMPORTANT PROBLEM THE PLACEMENT OF THE FRAME/SUPPORTS AROUND THE WINDSHIELD SIGNIFICANTLY BLOCKS THE DRIVER S VIEW OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHEN MAKING TIGHT LEFT HAND TURNS 
ONE MAIN REASON I CHOOSE THIS VAN WAS THE ADDED SAFETY FEATURS
ONE OF BETTER SOUND AND MOBILE SYSTEMS I VE HAD THUS FAR 
ONE OF THE BEST CARS I VE OWNED FOR HANDLING ON THE ROAD ALSO THE MOST QUIET VARIABLE POWER STEERING LIGHT WHEN PARKING HEAVIER WHEN AT SPEED GIVES THE FEELING OF GREAT CONTROL I HAVE OWNED MANY CARS SINCE MY TEENAGE YEARS BEGINNING IN 1948 W 
ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF DRIVING IS SEEING THE WING IN THE REAR VIEW 
ONE OF THE BEST STEREO AND HD CAR SYSTEMS I HAVE EVER HAD INCLUDING A BLIND MUSICIAN WHO THINKS ITS THE BEST CAR STEREO
ONE OF THE BEST UX WITH SOME HICKUPS IN NAVIGATION SEARCH 
ONE OF THE BETTER VEHICLES FOR VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE THAT OWN A CAMARO IS THE POOR VISIBILITY IT ISN T THE EASIEST CAR TO SEE OUT OF I KNEW THIS GOING INTO IT BUT I ALSO TRYING TO BE HONEST 
ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS WE HAVE ABOUT THE CAR IS HOW THE RADIO SYNCS WITH A BLUETOOTH PHONE 1 YOU CAN ONLY PAIR ONE DEVICE AT A TIME MY WIFE AND I BOTH USE THE CAR SO ONLY ONE OF US CAN HAVE THE CAR SETUP FOR HANDSFREE PHONE USE 2 YO 
ONE OF THE FEW DISAPPOINTMENTS WITH THIS VEHICLE IS THE CONCIERGE 
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR BUYING WAS WINDSHIELD
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I BOUGHT THE OUTLANDER WAS BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY FEATURES THE CAR IS BUILT WELL AND IS VERY RELIABLE 
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE WAS BECAUSE OF THE BLIND SPOT SIGNAL IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AND THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALARM THAT I GOT USED TO HAVING ON MY PREVIOUS CAR THE REGAL 
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I PURCHASED THE CAR WAS THE LEXICON SOUND SYSTEM
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE PURCHASED THE CAR WAS FOR THE SAFETY FEATURES AND SAFETY RATING I ALWAYS FEEL SAFE IN IT WE HAD A 2012 XC60 AND WERE IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WITH LITTLE PHYSICAL HARM TO OURSELVES WHICH IS WHY WE PURCHASED ANOTHER XC 
ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS I VE BEEN A LONG TIME SUBARU DRIVER IS BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY OF THE CAR 
ONE OF THE REASONS I BOUGHT THIS CAR WAS BECAUSE THE VISIBILITY IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD V70 WAS 
ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE THE GLK WAS THE VISIBILITY I FEEL IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE SO MANY SUV S BOTH SMALL AND LARGE HAVE MADE THE WINDOWS FAR TOO SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE GLK STILL HAS 
ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE THIS CAR OVER OTHER CONVERTIBLES IS THE REAR VISIBILITY WAS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD 
ONE OF THE REASONS WE CHOSE THIS CAR WAS THE SUPREME VISIBILITY FROM THE COCKPIT 
ONE OF THE SAFEST CARS I HAVE DRIVEN 
ONE OF THE THINGS I HATE THE MOST IN THE ENTIRE CAR IS THAT WHEN I PLUG IN MY PHONE TO CHARGE IT AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON THE ITUNES I VE HEARD THE SAME SONG START 1000 TIMES 
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE BEST ABOUT MY CAR IS THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS THEY WORK SO WELL! IT REALLY IS A SIMPLE THING BUT I VE HAD ISSUES WITH WIPERS IN THE PAST AND MY INFINITI S WIPERS ARE THE BEST EVER!
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CONVINCED ME TO BUY THIS CAR IS BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY FEATURES 
ONE OR THE REASONS THAT I PURCHASED BOTH MY LR2 AND LR4 IS THE ABILITY TO SEE OUT OF ALL THE WINDOWS NO BLIND SPOTS 
ONE PUSH OF A BUTTON
ONE REASON WE BOUGHT THE MURANO WAS BECAUSE OF ITS SAFETY FEATURES 
ONE SEATBELT RATTLES
ONE SMALL THING IS A SIDE EFFECT OF A GOOD THING THE WINDSHIELD IS HUGE WITH GREAT VISIBILITY BUT THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS THEN NEED TO GO ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE END OF THE GLASS WE LIVE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE UNITED STATES AND WHEN THE SNOW/ 
ONE SMALL THING IS THAT WHEN I USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT IS GREAT THAT IT SWITCHES TO A NIGHT COLOR SCHEME BUT IT DOES IT EVERY TIME I GO UNDER AN OVERPASS WHICH MEANS THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE SCREEN GOES BLANK AS IT GOES BACK AND FORTH BETWE 
ONE SOURCE FOR ALL/MOST FUNCTIONS IS DIFFICULT TO OPERATE ESPECIALLY WHILE OPERATING THE VEHICLE 
ONE SWEET SAFE RIDE
ONE THE NAVIGATION ON MY IPHONE 6 PLUS OS8 3 DOESN T WORK CAN NOT HEAR VOICE ONLY TIME IT WORKS IS IF I AM ON ITUNES RADIO TWO GETTING ME TO THE NUMBER I LIKE TO CALL TAKES A FEW TRY S FOR IT TO UNDERSTAND MY DIRECTIONS
ONE THING IS THAT WHEN YOU TURN ON THE HEADLIGHTS THE AUDIO/ENTERTAINMENT TOUCHPANEL IS DIMMED SO IF YOU DRIVE WITH YOUR HEADLIGHTS ON DURING THE DAYTIME IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE TOUCHSCREEN IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE IF THE CLOCK WAS A LARG 
ONE THING THA ANNOYS ME IS WHEN YOU TRY TO TOUCH THE SCREEN AND BUMP THE FAN OR AC BUTTONS BELOW IT IT HAPPENS WAY TO EASILY
ONE THING THAT WOULD BE NICE IF I COULD HAVE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION FOR MY GPS ON MY PHONE BUT STILL LISTEN TO THE RADIO IF YOU HAVE RADIO ON BUT WANT THE GPS TO COME THROUGH THE CAR IT WON T WORK I HAVE TO HAVE THE BLUETOOTH ON FOR MY GPS A 
ONE THING WE MISSED ON OUR OLD FIESTA WAS THE CONCAVE MIRROR ON THE OUTER CORNER OF OUR SIDE MIRRORS WHICH WOULD CATCH OUR BLIND SPOTS 
ONE TOUCH AND HANDS FREE CALLING
ONE TOUCH TO AUDIO SCREEN INSTEAD OF PUSH HOME/AUDIO
ONE WORD BOSE!
ONE WOULD THINK HONDA COULD COME UP W/BETTER WINDSHIELD WIPERS 
ONLINE TUTORIALS ON HOW TO USE MANY OF THE FEATURES IS NEEDED IT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH EASIER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPERATE SOME FEATURES PRINTED MANUALS ARE JUST NOT ENOUGH 
ONLY 1 CD PLAYER
ONLY 1 SUN VISOR LIKE TWO TO BLOCK SUN SIDE AND FRONT 
ONLY 2 OUT OF LIST
ONLY 550 MILES DRIVEN SINCE PURCHASE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO ANSWER SURVERY QUESTIONS
ONLY 6 PRESETS FOR RADIO TOO MANY SCREENS FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
ONLY ABOUT BLIND SPOT FORWARD WHEN TURNING LEFT CAUSED BY L/SIDE MIRROR POSSIBLY TOO CLOSE TO DOOR?
ONLY ANNOYING THING IS WHEN I USE VOICE ACTIVATED PHONE CALLS THE PROGRAM OFTEN MAKES MISTAKES OR ASKS ME IF I REALLY WANT TO CALL THE PERSON I ASKED FOR BUT THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT AND THE BLUE TOOTH CONNECTION ALWAYS WORKS 
ONLY APPLE PRODUCTS WORK WITH THE USB PORT I DON T USE APPLE PRODUCTS SO MOST FEATURE S I CANT USE
ONLY BECAUSE I DON T HAVE IT
ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE HERE IN THE INABILITY TO COMPOSE AND READ TEXT MESSAGES IN THE CAR 
ONLY COMPLAINT IS ROOF IS TO LOW MAKING SIDE FRONT REAR VISION NOT AS GOOD AS IT WOULD BE WITH COUPLE INCHES TALLER GLASS
ONLY COMPLAINT IS SPEAKERS THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD 
ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT I HAVE TO SWIPE TO GET TO THE ADDITIONAL CHANNELS IT CAN INTERRUPT DRIVING THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO PUT ALL IN ONE SCREEN TO MINIMIZE SWIPING WHILE DRIVING 
ONLY DOOR SPEAKERS ADD 2 SPEAKERS IN TRUNK MOUNT
ONLY DOWN FLAW OF THE CAR IS WHEN CHANGING LANES YOU CAN T DOUBLE CHECK BLIND SPOTS BY LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER ESPECIALLY ON THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRRORS NEED TO BE ADJUSTED CORRECTLY IMMEDIATELY 
ONLY DRIVEN 500 MILES HAVE NOT NOTICED ANYTHING OUT OF ORDINARY OR WHAT I EXPECTED
ONLY FRONT WHEEL DRIVE
ONLY FUNCTION NOT FULLY SATISFIED CANNOT SEE LIST OF SONGS FROM IPHONE ON THE SYSTEM ONLY SEE THE CURRENT SONG PLAYING 
ONLY GOT NAVIGATION BECAUSE IT WAS REQUIRED AS PART OF A PACKAGE WITH THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
ONLY HAVE RADIO AND CD PLAYER
ONLY HAVE USED THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM SO FAR 
ONLY HAVING THE VEHICLE A SHORT TIME I FIND THE MYSELF GETTING USED TO PRESET BUTTONS AND RADIO CONTROLS IN GENERAL TO BE A BIT UNMANAGEABLE UNTIL I GET USED TO IT I WILL HAVE TO TRY USING THE BUILT IN VOICE CONTROLS BUT I DID NOT BUY T 
ONLY IF I COULD KEEP IT CONNECTED
ONLY ISSUE ALTHOUGH MINOR IS REAR VIEW VISIBILITY DUE TO HIGH REAR SEATS
ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS WHEN CONNECTED TO STREAMING MEDIA PANDORA SONGZA SPOTIFY THE SYSTEM WILL DISPLAY THE ARTWORK AND INFO OF THE FIRST SONG PLAYED BUT WILL NOT UPDATE WHEN NEW SONGS COME ON IT S REALLY ANNOYING SHOULD BE A SOFTWARE UPDA 
ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS WITH BLIND SPOTS LOOKING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT AT INTERSECTIONS/WHEN TURNING ESPECIALLY TURNING TO THE LEFT 
ONLY ISSUE IN USING VOICE CONTROL IS THE DEFAQULT SETTING OF HAVING TO PRESS THE TALK BUTTON TWICE TO TELL WHAT YOU WANT 
ONLY ISSUE IS THAT THERE IS NO VISUAL REFERENCE ON THE HOOD DISTANCE TO THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WHEN PARKING CAN ONLY BE ESTIMATED MY WIFE HAS A PROBLEM WITH IT I DO NOT 
ONLY ISSUE IS THE CAR IS SO LIGHT WHEN ITS WINDY IM SCRED TO DRIVE IT BEVAUSE IT BLOWS ME ALL OVER THE ROAD I WISH IT WOULD CHANGE
ONLY ISSUE IS THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS WHEN TURNING THEM UP AT ALL
ONLY ISSUE IS VOICE COMMANDS HAVE TO FACE MICROPHONE AND SHOUT 
ONLY ISSUE IS WITH NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT GETS TO BE A CHORE TO INPUT A DESTINATION AND TOOK A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOESN T REALLY MAKE IT MUCH FASTER AND SOMETIMES TAKES LONGER 
ONLY LISTEN TO RADIO / CD OR JUMP DRIVE WHEN DRIVING I DON T USE THE BLUETOOTH 
ONLY MAJOR FLAW I HAD DRIVING 6 000 MILES ON VACATION WAS THE HOOD SEEMED HIGHER THAN OUR 2004 2500 HD RIDE WAS SUPER AND FELT VERY SAFE PULLING OUR 14 000# 5TH WHEEL WE HAD TOTALED OUR 2004 IN WATERLOO IA AND BOUGHT THIS AND STARTED PULLING 5TH 
ONLY ONE CUP HOLDER FOR BACK SEAT
ONLY ONE FRONT WIPER CAN BE PLACED IN AN UP POSITION MINOR INCONVENIENCE
ONLY ONE THING SLIGHTLY BOTHERS ME THE DASHBOARD VOLUME KNOB LOOKS A BIT CHEAP AND CHEERFUL NOT QUITE THE QUALITY LOOK AS THE OTHER CONTROLS PERHAPS NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE LARGER MORE SOLID LOOKING 
ONLY ONE VENT FOR REAR
ONLY PLUG IN PHONE OR CD PLAYER FREQUENTLY SO DON T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER QUESTION
ONLY PROBLEM I VE HAD WAS I TOOK CAR TO DEALER A WEEK AGO FOR SERVICE WHEN THEY CALLED ME TO INFORM ME CAR WAS READY I ARRIVED AT DEALER AND PAID BILL I PICKED UP CAR AND WENT HOME ALL WEEK COMPUTER HAD PROBLEMS THE MILEAGE SYSTEM NUMBERS MEASU 
ONLY PROBLEM IS BLUETOOTH RECOGNITION OF VOICE RECOGNITION NUMBERS
ONLY PROBLEM IS MAKING A LEFT TURN THE FRONT PILLAR BLOCKS THE VIEW OF THE ROAD 
ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT AFTER THE CAR SITS FOR A FEW DAYS AT THE AIRPORT I HAVE HAVE TO PAIR MY IPHONE AGAIN THIS IS A MINOR PROBLEM
ONLY QUESTION WHICH I HAVE NOT BEEN TO THE DEALER TO ASK ABOUT IS THE SIDE MIRROR WARNING LIGHT WHEN AN OBJECT IS CLOSE BY THE DRIVERS SIDE SEEMS TO BE GOING ON WHEN THERE IS NOTHING THERE AND STAYING ON LONGER IN THIS SITUATION OR WHEN IT IS 
ONLY REASON I DON T FEEL ALL THAT SAFE IS BECAUSE I DRIVE A TRUCK WITH FULL ARMOR AROUND IT
ONLY SEEM TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT PANDORA VIS USB PLUG IN FROM IPAD 
ONLY SPOT THAT PRESENTS CHALLENGE IS THE FRONT CORNERS WHERE THE DOORFRAMES AND EDGES OF WINDSHIELDS BLOCK VISION THE CAR IS SOLID RESPONSIVE AND VERY EASY TO DRIVE FOR LONG DISTANCES WITHOUT FATIGUE 
ONLY THE FRONT SPEAKERS ARE GOOD THE REST LACK THE PUNCH TO SUPPORT THIS BIG VEHICLE 
ONLY USE RADIO
ONLY USE RADIO AND BLUETOOH FOR MY PHONE
ONLY USE/NEED SIMPLE AUDIO SYSTEM MINI PERFORMS VERY WELL
ONLY VISABLY ISSUES I HAVE IS WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT AND THE REAR VEHICLES BEHIND ME TEND TO BLIND ME WITH THE SIDE MIRRORS I M LOWER TO THE GROUND AND THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE I HAVE TO MOVE THE SIDE MIRRORS DOWN TO REMOVE THE LIGHT WISH AUTODIM 
ONLY WHAT I HAD MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE NAVIGATION NOT HAVING A CANCEL OPTION WHEN GIVING DIRECTIONS
ONLY WISH I HAD ORDERED THE LARGER ENGINE
ONLY WISH IT HAD SPEAKERS IN BACK SEAT AREA
ONSTAR
ONSTAR HANDS FREE CALLING I MUST REPEAT THE NAME OVER AND OVER DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM IN MY PREVIOUS CADILLAC?
ONSTAR I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ONSTAR I TELL EVERYONE THEY NEED IT 
ONSTAR IS EXCEPTIONAL
ONSTAR IS MOSTLY SHIIT AND THE BUILT IN APPS WORK EXCEPT THEY RE EITHER OVERPRICED REDUNDANT OR BOTH MOST PEOPLE HAVE CELL PHONES SO HOW ABOUT A USEFUL APP LIKE GOOGLE MAPS OR WAZE? NOT SOME GARBAGE WHERE I HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE TO A MAP SERVICE 
ONSTAR IS USING A CELL CARRIER THAT DOES NOT WORK WHERE I LIVE AND WORK THIS IS VERY UNACCEPTABLE I HAVE A 2014 GMC TERRAIN THAT WORKS PERFECTLY 
ONSTAR NAVIGATION SYSTEMS REALLY STICKS I PREFER TO INPUT MY DESTINATION INSTEAD OF HAVING TO CALL THEM OR GO TO MAP QUEST THIS IS ALSO REALLY HARD TO MAKE CHANGES WHEN IN ROUTE AND DOESN T SHOW ANY POINT OF INTEREST 
ONSTAR SHOULD NOT BE LOCATED ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TOO EASY TO HIT BY ACCIDENT WHEN ADJUSTING MIRROR 
ONSTAR STILL DOES NOT HAVE MY HOME ADDRESS IN ITS SYSTEM CORRECTLY TAKES PEOPLE 1 5 MILES PAST MY HOUSE 4015 SW HIGHWAY J PLATTSBURG MO I THINK THE SYSTEM OTHERWISE WORKS BEAUTIFULLY 
OPEN VIEW OF FORWARD VISIBILITY 
OPENING AND CLOSING SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
OPENING IN BACK COULD BE WIDER
OPENING OF FRONT DOORS GETTING OUT BOTH SIDES SHOULD HAVE STOP ANGLES GOOD FEATURE THAT DOORS GO WIDE
OPENOMEDER IS LAME
OPERATING THE TOUCH SCREEN PANEL WHILE DRIVING
OPERATING THESE SYSTEMS IS NOT TRIVIAL I HAVE HAD OTHER SYSTEMS IN TOYOTAS AND THEY ARE EASIER 
OPERATION EASE
OPERATION OF NAV SYSTEM
OPERATOR ERROR EASE OF LEARNING HOW TO USE ALL THE APPS 
OPTED FOR BASE SYSTEM COULD BE BETTER BUT DOES WELL CONSIDERING 
OPTICS OF SIDE MIRRORS IS EXCEPTIONAL
OPTION FOR A SCREEN WITHOUT NAVIGATION THAT DIALYSIS INCOMING CALLS AND SONG TITLES ALSO FOUR STANDARD SPEAKER SYSTEM WOULD BE FAR BETTER THAN THE HEADPHONE STYLE DUAL SPEAKER SYSTEM 
OPTION FOR STEERING TRACKING HEADLIGHTS SHOULD HAVE TRICKLED DOWN TO THE PREMIUM PLUS TRIM BY NOW THEY ARE VERY GOOD HEADLIGHTS NONE THE LESS
OPTION FOR WINK FULL SIZE MIRROR
OPTION OF UPGRADING TO A NAME BRAND AUDIO SYSTEM
OPTION TO CHANGE BAND WITH OR TO SWITCH TO BLUETOOTH ON STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
OPTION TO CHANGE MAP VIEW
OPTION TO HAVE LANE DEPARTURE NOT AVAILABLE ON MY MODEL
OPTION TO OPT OUT OF 3 MONTH TRIAL OF SIRIUS DON T USE SATELLITE RADIO AT ALL
OPTIONAL 4 WHEEL DRIVE
OPTIONAL REAR VIEW CAMERA EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET ACTIVATED STAFF HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF STARSCAN ONE QUOTE WAS 700 00 TO ACTIVATE!
OPTIONS
OPTIONS AVAILABLE WHILE IN MOTION ARE TOO LIMITED 
OPTIONS FOR ENTERTAINMENT
OPTIONS FOR LISTENING TO MUSIC AND THE PLACEMENT OF THE MUSIC SAY BALANCING OF THE AUDIO INSIDE THE VEHICLE 
OPTIONS GALORE 
OPTIONS TO FIND A LOCATION FOR EXAMPLE IF I WANT TO FIND ALL THE STARBUCKS IN THE AREA I DON T WANT TO HAVE TO KNOW A SPECIFIC ADDRESS BEFOREHAND 
OPTIONS TOO EXPENSIVE
ORAGE PEEL
ORANGE DISPLAY BACKLIGHT DOESN T MATCH THE CAR S INTERIOR LIGHTING SCHEME 
ORANGE IS NOT MY FAVORITE COLOR SCHEME FOR ANYTHING I DISLIKE THE ORANGE DASH DISPLAY AND RADIO DISPLAY 
ORDERED UPGRADED SYSTEM IT SHOULD HAVE BETTER SOUND ALSO SOUND QUALITY OF INCOMING CALLS IS BELOW AVERAGE
ORDERING MUSIC BY GENRE
ORIGINAL HEADLIGHT BULBS PUT OUT VERY POOR LIGHT 
OTHE THAN PROBLEMS ALREADY STATED REST IS GOOD
OTHER THAN LEARNING HOW TO USE IT EASY BUT THE FIRST FEW WEEKS WAS DIFFERENT 
OTHER THAN MY PROBLEM OF GETTING IN AND OUT OF VEHICLE WHICH COULD BE APPROVED BY HAVING THE RUNNING BOARDS BE A PART OF THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE THIS VEHICLE IS ALL THAT I HAVE BEEN WANTING FOR YEARS I VE DRIVEN A MINI VAN FOR OVER 20 YRS AND THI 
OTHER THAN NAVIGATION SYSTEM EVERYTHING IS OUTSTANDING 
OTHER THAN SIRIUS RADIO I VE RARELY USED ANY EVENTUALLY I WILL 
OTHER THAN THE NAVIGATION SCREEN ALL OTHER SCREENS ONLY DISPLAY AS FULL SCREEN BRIEFLY THEN DEFAULT BACK TO SPLIT SCREEN MODE BE NICE TO HAVE THE RADIO OR MEDIA SCREEN REMAIN ON FULL TO CHANGE RADIO STATIONS WITHOUT USING THE STEERING WHEEL 
OTHER THAN THE POOR REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT I REALLY LOVE MY CAR I LIKE STE STYLING VERY MUCH I FEEL THAT I GOT A VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MY MONEY 
OTHER THAN THE SPEAKERS THIS SYSTEM IS THE BEST THAT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED 
OTHER THAN THE SUSPENSION ISSUE I MENTIONED EARLIER I LIKE THE CAR I JUST WISH IT WOULD RIDE A LITTLE SMOOTHER HAD I DRIVEN THE CAR A FEW MORE TIMES BEFORE MY DECISION I WOULD PROBABLY NOT BOUGHT IT 
OTHER THAN THE THE SIDE MIRRORS WHICH ARE MUCH EASIER TO SEE AROUND I STILL HAVE BLIND SOPTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SET BELT LOCKS AND HOLDS ME IN PLACE WHEN I MOVE TOO FAST LIKE TRYING TO TURN TO LOOK OUT THE BACK WINDOW 
OTHER THAN THE VISIBILITY BEING OBSCURED WHEN LOOKING RIGHT AT TIMES DURING CERTAIN SITUATIONS THE VISIBILITY IS REALLY GOOD!
OTHER THAN VOICE RECOGNITION WHICH IS POOR EVERYTHING ELSE IS A 10 
OTHER THAN WISHING I HAD THE SAFETY FEATURE THAT LETS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RE GETTING TO CLOSE TO AN OBJECT WHEN BACKING UP THE ONE COMMENT I HAVE ON THE VISIBILITY IS THAT WHEN LOOKING OUT OF THE CENTRAL REAR VIEW MIRROR I FEEL AS THOUGH I CAN ONL 
OTHER THEN THE CUTTING OUT OF CHANNELS DURING DRIVING CONDITIONS IT IS GREAT 
OTHERS CANNOT HEAR ME WELL ON BLUETOOTH CALLS THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS TOO CONFUSION AND I RARELY USE IT AS A RESULT 
OUR 2000 SUBURBAN HAD EXTENSIONS ON THE SUN VISORS WHICH OUR 2007 SUBURBAN AND 2015 SILVERADO DO NOT WE FOUND THAT THEY HELP PREVENT SUN GLARE
OUR 2012 TRAVERSE HAD FACTORY INSTALLED BLIND SPOT MIRRORS AND THIS 2015 DOES NOT WHICH CAUSES THIS VEHICLE TO HAVE VERY BAD BLIND SPOTS 
OUR EARLIER MODEL CAMRY HAD A SUN VISOR THAT FOLDED DOWN AND PULLED OUT TO EXTEND THE EFFECTIVENESS WHEN THE SUN WAS LOWER IN THE HORIZON WHICH WAS MUCH BETTER 
OUR FAVORITE FEATURE OF THE VEHICLE IS THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA 
OUR GARMIN GPS DISPLAY SHOWS THE CURRENT SPEED LIMIT ON EVERY STRETCH OF HIGHWAY THE BENZ NAV DOES NOT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE THIS IN THE BENZ 
OUR GREATEST DISLIKE IS THE POOR VISIBILITY FRONT AND REAR DUE TO THE STYLING I AM 6 FEET TALL AND CANNOT SEE THE HOOD PARKING IS A PROBLEM NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE HOW CLOSE TO THE CURB THE FRONT BUMPER IF IT HAD ONE IS BACKING IS A PROBLE 
OUR KIDS LOVE THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS 
OUR OLD EXPEDITION HAD A REAR MIRROR SO I COULD LOOK BACK AT THE KIDS WHILE DRIVING SO I DIDN T HAVE TO TURN AROUND & COULD KEEP MY EYES ON THE ROAD THIS NEW ONE DOESN T HAVE THAT I MISS IT 
OUR ONLY EXPERIENCE IS WITH THE BLUE TOOTH FOR THE PHONE LISTENING TO A BOOK ON THE PHONE AND THE RADIO WE ARE STILL LEARNING THESE SYSTEMS AND WE ARE SURE RATINGS WILL GO UP WHEN WE HAVE MORE TIME USING THE SYSTEM S 
OUR PLUG IN NAVIGATION DEVICE SHOWS US THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT AND THE SPEED AT WHICH I AM DRIVING THE CURRENT BUILT IN ONE ON THE VEHICLE DOES NOT IT S NICE TO KNOW HOW FAST YOU SHOULD BE GOING WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING IN NEW AREAS WHERE THE SPEED 
OUR RIGHT WIPER NEED ADJUSTMENT
OUR THIRD AUDI IN SIX YEARS AND THIS ONE FEELS MOST SECURE AND STABLE
OUR VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE NAVIGATION AS WE USE OUR CELL PHONES FOR THAT BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IS EXCELLENT THE LOOK OF THE TOUCH SCREEN IS GREAT 
OUR VEHICLE INCLUDES A CHARGING PAD BUT IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOST PHONES THEREFORE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE IT ALSO I HAVE NOT SPENT ENOUGH TIME TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE VOICE CONTROL FEATURES PLEASE ALSO SEE MY PRIOR COMMENTS REGARDING 
OUR VOICE DOESN T WORK WELL WITH COMMANDS

OUTSIDE MIRRORS OBJECTS ARE BIGGER ON ONE SIDE AND NO HEATING ON MIRRORS
OUTSIDE MIRRORS PLUS SIDE ASSIST
OUTSIDE MIRRORS SHOULD BE LARGER
OUTSIDE MIRRORS SHOULD COME WITH EXTRA WIDE MIRROR INSERT FOR BETTER VISIBILITY WHILE CHANGING LINES
OUTSIDE MIRRORS SHOULD HAVE THE BLIND SPOT VIEW SHOULD HAVE THE AUTO LIGHTS AND NOT HAVE THEM ON ALL TIME TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ON IN THE EVENING
OUTSIDE MIRRORS TO SMALL SHOULD BE MADE LARGER AND HAVE A MIRROR SYSTEM LIKE FORD HAS ON THEIR TRUCKS THE INSIDE DOOR SPEAKERS ON ALL DOORS ARE TO LOW THEY ARE IN THE WAY WHEN GETTING IN AND OUT OF THE CAR THE SPEAKER GETS HIT BY THE SHOE WHEN G

PART OF THE REASON FOR PURCHASING THE SUBARU WAS THE VISIBILITY EXCELLENT!!!
PART OF VISIBILITY PROBLEM IS THE FACT IT IS A CONVERTIBLE
PARTICULARLY LIKE THE HIGHLIGHT MODE OF THE MEMORY BUTTONS WHEN YOU LIGHTLY TOUCH THEM THEY REVEAL IN THE LCD DISPLAY WHAT S STORED IN MEMORY FOR THAT BUTTON 
PARTICULARLY PLEASED WITH ABILITY TO USE PHONE THROUGH CAR SYSTEM CONTINUE TO ENJOY VARIOUS MUSIC AND NEWS CHANNELS ON SATELLITE RADIO

PREVIOUS COMMENT ABOUT OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS 
PREVIOUS COMMENT REGARDING BLOCKAGE OF PEDESTRIAN LANE/CYCLIST FROM A PILLAR LOOK AT A TOYOTA VENZA FOR A SOLUTION 
PREVIOUS DESTINATION LIST IN THE NAVIGATION LISTS DESTINATIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE NAVIGATION IT ISN T USER FRIENDLY TO PROGRAM DESTINATIONS LIKE HOME 
PREVIOUS TO THIS CAR I HAD ANOTHER MAKE THAT ALLOWED FOR THE DROP DOWN OF THE HEADRES IN THE BACK SEAT WHEN NOT BEING USED THIS FEATURE GAVE A LOT MORE VISIBITY TO THE BACK / REAR WINDOW WHILE DRIVING
PREVIOUS VAN HAD WARNING SIGNALS FOR LANE CHANGING AND BACKUPS DID NOT GET ON NEW VAN AND AM TRULY DISAPPOINTED WE DID NOT GET ON NEW ONE THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL VANS 
PREVIOUS VEHICLE BMW 535 HAD SUPERIOR ELECTRONICS
PREVIOUS VEHICLE WAS A FORD ESCAPE WITH 4WD I LIVE THE EAST COAST WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF SNOW AND ICE AWD DID NOT GIVE THE SAME FEELING OF SECURITY S 4WD VEHICLE SEEMED EASY TO SLIP WHEN STARTING A TURN FROM A STOP UNDER ICY CONDITIONS ADDIN 
PREVIOUSLY COMMENTED ON SIZE OF HEAD RESTS AND CREATING BLIND SPOTS 
PREVIOUSLY I HAD A 2011 NISSAN MURANO WITH A BOSE SOUND SYSTEM AND THE QUALITY OF THAT SOUND SYSTEM BASS VOLUME ETC WAS BETTER QUALITY THAN THE 2015 NISSAN MURANO 
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED RADIO STATION PRE SELECT TOUCH SCREEN FEATURE MAKE IT EASIER TO USE SEPARATE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FROM AUDIO/ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM 
PREVIOUSLY OWNED 2010 TAURUS SHO WAS VERY HAPPY WITH PERFORMANCE AND FIND AFTER 4 000 MILES THIS 2015 HANDLES THE SAME BUT WITH MORE REFINEMENTS COULDN T BE HAPPIER THUS FAR 
PREVIOUSLY OWNED A 2009 VENZA BLINDSPOT MIRRORS ARE MUCH IMPROVED 
PREVIOUSLY OWNED ACCORD WITH EXTENSIONS IN SUN VISORS CURRENT CIVIC DOES NOT HAVE THEM BUT THEY ARE VERY USEFUL WHEN SUN VISOR ROTATED TO SIDE WINDOW DURING DAILY NORTH/SOUTH DRIVE 
PRICE
PRINT IS VERY SMALL ON MAPS
PRINT ON LCD DISPLAY SHOULD BE LARGER FONT SO IT CAN BE READ AT A GLANCE
PRINT UP EASY TO FOLLOW STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW TO USE THE NAVIGATION DIRECTION SYSTEM 
PRINTED OWNER S MANUAL NOT INCLUDED WITH VEHICLE BUT AVAILABLE ON LINE ONLY 
PRIOR TO PURCHASING THIS VEHICLE I DID EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND A COMMON THEME FROM THOSE WHO PURCHASED IT PREVIOUSLY WAS THE LESS THAN STELLAR SPEAKER SYSTEM THIS WAS NOT A HIGH PRIORITY SO IT DID NOT HINDER MY DECISION HOWEVER THE FEEDBACK WAS 
PRIOR TO THIS CR V I HAD AN 07 CR V DESIGN OF THE POSTS THE WINDSHIELD SETS INTO HAVE CHANGED A BIT AND CREATED A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AT STOP SIGNS BECAUSE YOU CAN LOSE SIGHT OF PEDESTRIANS 
PRIVACY TINT UNDULY INTERFERES WITH REAR VISION 
PROBABLY BY JUST BUYING THE UPGRADED MODEL LEAF WITH THE BETTER SOUND SYSTEM I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR 
PROBABLY DID NOT GET THE AUDIO SYSTEM I WANTED NOT SURE WHY THEY ARE MARKETED AS PREMIUM SOUND AND JBL PREMIUM SOUND DEFINITELY LACKING IN THE AUDIO DEPARTMENT I DO NOT LIKE THE OPERATION OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND GENERALLY USE MY SMARTPHONE 
PROBABLY IT IS USER UNFAMILIARITY BUT I DON T REALLY KNOW HOW TO USE THE AUDIO FUNCTION TO DO ANYTHING BUT ACCESS THE PHONE AND MAKE CALLS HANDS FREE THE INTERNET CONNECTION WITH THE CAR RARELY WORKS OR WE ARE DOING IT WRONG WE HAVE MULTIPLE DE 
PROBABLY MY FAULT FOR NOT TAKING THE TIME TO BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH IT BUT I M NOT REALLY THRILLED WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
PROBABLY MY LEAST FAVORITE PART OF THIS WHOLE CAR IS THE WONKY AND HARD TO USE TOUCHSCREEN SYSTEM 
PROBABLY NOTHING AT THIS TIME I HAVEN T FIGURED OUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET 
PROBLEM AIMING THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED FURTHER I DO NOT LIKE AT ALL THAT THE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR TILTS DOWNWARD WHEN THE VEHICLE IS PUT INTO REVERSE IT IS DISTRACTING AND I DO NOT CARE FOR THE LOWER REFLECTED IMAGE ONE 
PROBLEM WITH BLIND SPOTS LEFT AND RIGHT LARGER MIRRORS WOULD HELP 
PROBLEM WITH VOICE ONCE IN A WHILE

PROBLEMS WITH CD PLAYER EJECT BUTTON
PROBLEMS WITH THE BLUE LINK
PROBLEMS WITH THE VOICE COMMANDS
PROCESS OF MAKING VOICE RECOGNIZED CALLS TO LENGTHY SHOULD JUST GO TO DIRECTED NAME/NUMBER WITHOUT ALL THE QUALIFYING STEPS
PROGRAMING AND SEE WHEN CAR LIGHTS ARE ON AND WHEN SUN IS SHINING 
PROGRAMMED CHANNELS ON MULTIPLE SCREENS SEEMS A LITTLE HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND NAVIGATE THROUGH ESPECIALLY WHILE DRIVING BUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS THE MOST DIFFICULT THING TO USE AND UNDERSTAND PLUS THE ACCURACY NEEDS IMPROVING AS DESCRIBED 
PROGRAMMING A DESTINATION IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED DISPLAY OF LARGER AREA OF POINTS OF INTEREST ON THE SCREEN
PROGRAMMING ADDRESSES ETC SEEMS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN ON OUR TSX
PROGRAMMING FAVORITE STATIONS 
PROGRAMMING IS MORE INVOLVED THAN OTHER VEHICLES
PROGRAMMING MEMORY BUTTONS COULD BE EASIER THIS IS MULTI FUNCTION IN THIS VEHICLE AND IT S HARD TO REMEMBER WHAT BUTTO DOES WHAT AFTER THE BUTTON IS PROGRAMMED 
PROGRAMMING OF PRESET STATIONS IS NOT INTUITIVE 
PROGRAMMING OF RADIO STATIONS
PROGRAMMING STATIONS AND EASE OF VOICE COMMANDS IS GOOD I AM A BIG FAN OF ONSTAR AND APPRECIATE THE AVAILABILITY IN ALL GM VEHICLES I WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT IT 
PROGRAMMING STATIONS IS A BIT CLUNKY 
PROGRAMMING THE NAV IS DIFFICULT THE TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS FOR PROGRAMMED STATIONS ARE HORRIBLE! NOT EASY TO SELECT AND NAVIGATE THEM!
PROGRAMMING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY CUMBERSOME 
PROGRAMMING THE PRE SET RADIO STATIONS IS A BEAR NOT INTUITIVE AT ALL 
PROGRAMMING VOICE COMMANDS IS TIME CONSUMING SYSTEM SOMETIMES FAILS TO REGISTER SHORT WORDS 
PROJECTION HEADLIGHTS GIVE AN UNUSUAL PATTERN AT THE OUTER EDGES 
PROJECTION OF HIGH BEAMS AT NIGHT NOT GREAT
PROJECTOR BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH ON HIGH BEAM THEY USE A HIR BULB THAT IS THE SAME WATTAGE ON HIGH OR LOW BEAM
PROP UP THE HOOD
PROPER INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO HANDLE STILL DON T KNOW WHETHER I CAN CONNECT AND LISTEN TO MY PHONE S MEDIA NEVER WORKED 
PROPER POSITIONAL USE OF REAR VIEW AND SIDE MIRRORS REDUCE 3/4 REAR VIEW ISSUE BACKUP CAMERA ELIMINATES REAR VIEW CONSTRAINTS WHEN IN REVERSE GEAR DAY OR NIGHT 
PROVIDE A COMPASS

PROVIDES MORE THAN I VE EVER HAD & THE SPEAKERS ARE AWSOME
PROVIDING AIR BAGS AND HIGH SEAT BACKS HAS TAKEN AWAY FROM VISION OUT BECAUSE OF INCREASED COLUMN SIZES I DESPERATELY NEED THE BLIND SPOT ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED WINDOW AREA 
PROXIMITY SENSOR THAT BRINGS UP OPTIONS ON THE SCREEN WHEN YOUR HAND GETS NEAR IT 
PROXIMITY SENSORS IN BUMPERS COULD BE HELPFUL BUT BLIND SPOT MIRRORS WITHIN THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS WOULD REALLY HELP
PULL DOWN OF VISOR AS WELL AS RIGHT EXTENDER SHOULD BE ADDED ALSO WHEN IT IS EXTENDED AND YOU PUSH IT UP THE EXTENSION HITS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THE PRESSURE OF THE WIPERS WAS NOT GREAT FROM START THEY STREAKED
PULLING INTO TRAFFIC AND THE CAR HESITATES TO RESPOND TO THE GAS PEDAL DEMAND AND ON COMING TRAFFIC IS NOW CLOSER TO YOU PUTTING YOU IN DANGER OF A COLLISION 
PURE AND SIMPLE IT IS NOT VERY GOOD AUDIO IS POOR AND HANDS FREE PHONE CLARITY NOT THE BEST 
PURE SOUND QUALITY FOR MUSIC OR PHONE CONVERSATION IS OUTSTANDING 
PUSH BUTTON GEAR SHIFTER
PUSH BUTTON STATION SELECTION BUTTONS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE

RADIO ISN T THE BEST BUT SINCE IT IS A GT3 I WOULD RATHER HEAR THE CAR 
RADIO KNOBS TACTILE FEEL LACKING
RADIO LOUDSPEAKERS SOUND BAD I AM AN AUDIO ENGINEER BUT RECEPTION IS GOOD AND THE USE OF EXTERNAL MEMORY STICK IS EXCELLENT AND I REALLY LIKE THE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY TO SEE THE CAR S STATS WHEN I WISH 
RADIO MUST BE ON TO USE NAVIGATION DISLIKE
RADIO MUST BE POWERED ON TO OPERATE CELL PHONE ON BLUETOOTH
RADIO NEED A LITTLE MORE BASS
RADIO NEEDS A SCAN FEATURE TO SAMPLE STATIONS FOR A FEW SECONDS AND MOVE TO THE NEXT TO ASSIST SEARCHING FOR PROGRAMS 
RADIO NEEDS TO HAVE BETTER TUNING QUICK SETS UP AND DOWN NOT JUST UP 
RADIO NOT THE EASIEST
RADIO OFFERS HD CHANNELS SOUND QUALITY ISN T ANY GOOD SOUND FADES IN AND OUT HAD TO TURN OFF HD CAPABILITY 
RADIO ONLY JUST LIKE I WANTED
RADIO OPERATIONG SEPERATLY FROM NAVIGATION SYSTEM
RADIO OPTIONS DESCRIBING THE CHANNEL ARTIST SONG ETC
RADIO PICKS UP PHILADELPHIA STATIONS MUCH FARTHER FROM STATION THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR CHEVY PRIZM
RADIO PRE SETS!
RADIO PRESET PAGES ARE INCONSISTENT WHEN CAR IS STARTED RADIO DOES NOT RETURN TO THE SAME PRESET PAGE ALSO SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO MOVE FROM ONE PRESET PAGE TO ANOTHER BY SWIPING 
RADIO PRESETS CONVENIENT AND SIMPLE TO USE
RADIO PRESETS PHONE SOUND & USAGE IS CONFUSING & INCONSISTENT 
RADIO PRESETS VOLUME CONTROL AND TUNING ON TOUCH SCREEN
RADIO PROGRAMING IS EASY AND STEREO SOUNDS WONDERFUL
RADIO RECEPTION 
RADIO RECEPTION BETTER COMMUNICATION SOUND WHEN USING YOUR PHONE WITH THE BUILT IN BLUE TOOTH 
RADIO RECEPTION BOTH AM AND FM COULD BE BETTER 
RADIO RECEPTION IN REMOTE AREAS
RADIO RECEPTION IS INCONSISTENT 
RADIO RECEPTION ISN T THE GREATEST PICKUP OF WEAK/DISTANT SIGNALS STRONGER ON MY OTHER CAR
RADIO RECEPTION NOT CONSISTENT
RADIO RECEPTION POOR
RADIO RECEPTION SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE WEAK
RADIO SCREEN IS HARD TO READ WHILE DRIVING TIME AND TEMP GUARD TO READ WHEN GLANCING OVER AT IT UNLESS U PROGRAM IT TO DISPLAY ONLY THAT AND NOT WHAT STATIONS YOU CAN CHANGE
RADIO SCREEN SORT OF DULL 
RADIO SEATS NOISE
RADIO SHOULD HAVE ON/OFF CONTROL NOT JUST MUTE 
RADIO SHOULD STATE NAME OF SONG AND ARTIST 
RADIO SIGNAL IS POOR AND CAN NOT USE VOICE RECOGNITION IT SUCKS THE NAVIGATION IS GREAT EXCEPT IT SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT ROAD YOU ARE GOING TO TURN ON SOONER
RADIO SIGNAL NEEDS RESOLVED!!!!
RADIO SOUND
RADIO SOUND AND EASY NAVIGATION SYSTEM
RADIO SOUND IS AWSOME
RADIO SOUND IS PRETTY ORDINARY 
RADIO SOUND IS VERY GOOD
RADIO SOUND QUALITY AND EASY BLUETOOTH/PHONE HOOKUP 
RADIO SOUND QUALITY OF STOCK SYSTEM COULD BE ENHANCED SOUND SYSTEM SPEAKERS IN THE CAR ARE BELOW AVERAGE I LIKE TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO / CD WHILE DRIVING BETTER SOUND SYSTEM IN MY PREVIOUS CAR / TOYOTA CELICA 
RADIO SOUND QUALITY SOUNDS A BIT MUFFLED
RADIO SOUND SPEAKERS 
RADIO SOUND SYSTEM
RADIO SOUND SYSTEM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT WORSE THAN PREVIOUS MODEL YEAR 
RADIO SOUND SYSTEM!
RADIO SOUNDS DISTANT POOR SOUND QUALITY 
RADIO SOUNDS GOOD USB DRIVE WITH MUSIC PLAYS WELL JUST HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SET UP A PLAYLIST HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET ONSTAR COMMUNICATION IS CLEAR EASY TO UNDERSTAND 
RADIO SOUNDS GREAT SOMETIMES PHONE RECEPTION NOT THAT GOOD HAVEN T USED NAV SYSTEM JUST HAD MAP ON 
RADIO SPEAKERS
RADIO SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER 
RADIO SPEAKERS HAVE TOO MUCH BASE AND NO ADJUSTMENT CONTROL HARD TO HEAR CRISP SOUNDS OVER THE HEAVY BASE 
RADIO STATIC
RADIO STATION AND MODE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE NEEDED TOO AWKWARD TO REACH THE PANEL WHEN DRIVING EASIER INTEGRATION OF MOBILE PHONE TO DISPLAY FOR NAV PURPOSES IS NEEDED AND A BACK UP CAMERA WOULD BE NICE 
RADIO STATION CONTROL TOO SENSITIVE CHANGES WITH ACCIDENTAL TOUCH NAVIGATION NOT ALWAYS CORRECT 
RADIO STATION CONTROLS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD BE GREAT
RADIO STATION LOCATING IS SOMEWHAT AWKWARD NAVIGATION SYSTEM REQUIRES TOWN/CITY FOR POINT OF INTEREST WOULD BE BETTER BY DISTANCE FROM POSITION OF CAR
RADIO STATION SELECTION BUT THIS ISSUE MAY BE USER PROBLEM WILL CHECK MANUAL TO DETERMINE IF I AM MISSING OR MISUSING A FEATURE 
RADIO STATION SELECTION COULD BE EASIER
RADIO STATION SELECTION HAVE TO LOOK AT TOUCH SCREEN DISTRACTING
RADIO STATION SELECTION IS CONFUSING 
RADIO STATIONS ARE HARD TO FIND HARD TO MAKE PANDORA PLAY THROUGH BLUTOOTH CONNECTIONS
RADIO STATIONS ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT TO GET TO THAT 5 OR 6 BAND OPTION MESSES ME UP NOT CONVENIENT AT ALL 
RADIO STATIONS CAN BE CHANGED BY SWIPING SIMILAR TO AN IPAD
RADIO STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS SHOULD BE DEDICATED AND NOT RELIED ON TO ACCESS OTHER DATA
RADIO SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO USE
RADIO SYSTEM DOES NOT FUCTION AT ALL
RADIO TOO QUIET
RADIO TUNING IS CUMBERSOME ESPECIALLY WHEN TRAVELLING INTO NEW AREAS NO SCAN/SEEK FEATURE SOMETIMES OLD FASHIONED IS BETTER FOR RADIO TUNING THT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE 
RADIO VOLUME SEEMS TO GO UP AND DOWN
RADIO WITH NAVIGATION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE WITHOUT HAVING TO PURCHASE ALL THE OTHER OPTIONS 
RADIO XM SELECTION AND PROGRAMMING IMPROVED 
RADIO/CLIMATE CONTROLS
RADIO/MEDIA USE VERY COMPLICATED HOPEFULLY WITH PRACTICE I WILL GET BETTER
RADIO/SOUND IS GREAT NAV IS TOUGH TO USE AS I JUST MENTIONED BEFORE ON THE RARE OCCASION THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE I AM GOING I USE MY IPHONE THIS IS SUCH A MINOR PART OF THE CAR NAVIGATION WHY SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT IT J D ?
RAIDO CONTRO S
RAIDO NOT WORKING
RAIN GUARDS MAKE IT A BIT HARD TO SEE BUT THAT S NOTHING ON YOU I SHOULDN T OF GOTTEN THEM
RAIN SENSING WIPERS ARE DIFFICULT TO CONTROL/UNDERSTAND
RAIN SENSING WIPERS SEEM TO HAVE A MIND OF THEIR OWN SOMETIMES AND THE OPERATING IS NOT QUITE AS REFINED AS WHAT I VE EXPERIENCED ON SOME OTHER LUXURY BRANDS 
RAIN SENSING WIPERS WOULD BE NICE AND WHEN THE WIPERS ARE ON THE LIGHTS NEED TO COME ON AUTOMATICALLY CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY LIMITED DOES THIS
RAIN SENSOR AUTO WIPERS ACTIVATE WAY TO SOON IN WINTER ONLY TO SMEAR WINDSHIELD CAUSING NUMEROUS WASHINGS THAT DEPLETES THE WIPER FLUID WAY TO SOON BEST TO NOT USE THIS FEATURE IN THE WINTER WORKS WELL IN THE SUMMER
RAIN SENSOR FOR WIPERS DO NOT ALWAYS PERFORM BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF PRECIPITATION OCCURRING 
RAIN SENSOR WORKS GREAT THE HEADLIGHTS ARE CLEAR AND BRIGHT 
RAIN SENSORED WIPERS ARE SLOW TO REACT AT TIMES AND I HAVE TO MANUALLY OVERRIDE
RAISED AREA WINGS ON HOOD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE THE LINES ON PARKING SPACES I HAVE TO ADJUST FREQUENTLY AFTER IN SPACE ON THE ROAD EVERYTHING IS FINE 
RAISED REAR HEADRESTS CAN BLOCK SOME VISION ROAD HANDLING AND LOW WEIGHT CENTER OF SPARK MAKES DRIVING FEEL SECURE 
RAM NEEDS TO INCLUDE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS IN THE VEHICLES THE SIZE OF THIS TRUCK MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT BLIND SPOTS EVEN WITH THE LARGER TOW MIRRORS THE TECHNOLOGY IS OUT THERE RAM NEEDS TO USE IT
RANDOM FUNCTION I HEAR A LOT OF THE SAME SONGS AND SOME SONGS ARE NEVER PLAYED 
RANGE DROPS WITH HEATER USE
RANGE OF BATTERY POWER
RANGE OF INPUTS AVAILABLE EVEN IF I DON T USE THEM ALL 
RANGE OF MUSIC SOURCES AND IPHONE QUALITY 
RANGE OF TELESCOPING STEERING WHEEL
RANGE ROVER LEADS THE WAY IN THIS AREA
RAPID ACCELERATION 
RAPID OFF OF RADIO INSTEAD OF DELAYED OFF 
RARE WINDOW VIEW ARE QUITE LIMITED I WISH BLIND SPOT DETECTION CAN BE AS ROBUST AS HONDA S CRV 
RARELY USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BECAUSE IT S EASIER TO USE GOOGLE MAPS ON THE IPHONE CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO GET TO XM RADIO FROM OTHER AUDIO SOURCES BECAUSE OF NO INTUITIVE WAY TO CHANGE BETWEEN XM AND RADIO 
RATED THIS WAY BECAUSE MOST OF THESE SYSTEMS ARE VERY COMPLICATED AND HARD TO OPERATE SAYING WORDS EXACTLY AS THEY ARE EXPECTED BY THE SYSTEM NOT QUICK TO PICK UP THE WORDS YOU ARE SAYING ETC 
RATHER COMPLICATED AND ANNOYING COULD BE DANGEROUS TO USE FUNCTIONS WHILE DRIVING I M OVER FIFTY SO I ASSUME MY OPINION DOESN T MATTER IN THIS REGARD ANYWAY 
RATHER LARGE BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER S SIDE TOWARDS THE REAR 
RATHER THAN AUTOMATIC PLAY HAVE A PLAY/PAUSE BUTTON FOR AUDIO 
RATHER THAN RELYING ON VOICE RECOGNITION TO SEARCH THE CONTACTS ON A SMARTPHONE TO INITIATE A PHONE CALL ADD A DISPLAY OF THE CONTACTS LIST SO THAT THERE IS A CHOICE TO TOUCH THE SCREEN OR NAVIGATE THE SCREEN WITHOUT HAVING TO USE VOICE RECOGNITI 
RATHER THAN USING SIDE MIRRORS WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE OTHER LANES EASIER 
RATING IS NOT BECAUSE IT IS A NISSAN JUKE NO CAR OR TRUCK I HAVE HAD HAS DONE AN ABOVE AVERAGE JOB OF BLUETOOTH CELL PHONE USE THE JUKE S IS AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN ANY OTHERS I HAVE USED PROBABLY 15 
RATINGS ARE DRIVER SPECIFIC PASSENGER SEAT TOO LOW 
RATTLE FROM SPEAKER FROM NEW VERY DISSAPOINTING
RAW POWER
RE REVERSE CAR NEEDS A BACKUP CAMERA VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE IN RTHIS CAR NEEDS A BACKUP CAMERA VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE IN REVERSE
REACH RANGE FROM DRIVER SEAT TO CONTROLS NEEDS TO BE REDUCED 
REACHING TO CHANNEL SCAN OR UP DOWN A STATION BUTTONS SHOULD BE CLOSER TO DRIVER OR ANGLED A BIT TOWARD DRIVER FOR EASIER REACH
READ AND COMPOSING TEXTS WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IF MY PHONE IS CONNECTED TO BLUETOOTH THE SOUND OF THE RINGER AND TEXT TONE DOES NOT WORK 
READ AND SEND TEXT MESSAGES
READ EMAIL WOULD BE HELPFUL
READ EMAILS TEXT SEND EMAIL TEXT HANDS FREE 
READ INCOME TEXT MESSAGES
READ SEAT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WE ARE A YOUNG COUPLE WITH CHILDREN CERTAINLY NOT THE TYPICAL LX DEMOGRAPHIC WITH THAT BEING SAID THE LX REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM INTERFACE SHOULD NOT FEEL LIKE AN AFTER THOUGHT WHICH IT DOES 
READ TEXT
READ TEXT FEATURE EASIER TO USE 
READ TEXT MESSAGES

READ TEXT TO ME WHILE DRIVING
READ VISIBILITY IN BLIND SPOT AREAS IS VERY LIMITED I DON T LIKE HAVING TO PUT SO MUCH FAITH IN THE TECHNOLOGY FEATURES TO ASSIST WITH THE LACK OF VISIBILITY 
READER FRIENDLY OWNERS MANUAL
READING CONTROLS IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT 
READING INCOMING TEXT MESSAGES
READING OF A TEXT MESSAGE IS AWESOME 
READING OF INSTRUCTION ARE INCOMPLETE ASUMES TO MANY THINGS AS AN OLDER PERSON WHO USES GARMIN GPS THIS IS A BIG STEP BACKWARD ON EASE OF USE ON HOW TO ENTER AND ACCESS INFORMATION IT IS NOT USER FREINDLY 
READING OF TEXT MESSAGES AND ABILITY TO HEAR

ROUTE SELECTION IS PRETTY BAD FIX IT!
ROUTING THAT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM GIVES YOU IS NOT ALWAYS THE SAME ROUTE
RT SIDE BLIND SPOT
RUGGEDNESS
RUN UP TIME UNTIL TURBO KICKS IN
RUNFLATS
RUNFLATS GIVE A HARD RIDE
RUNNING BOARDS
RUNNING BOARDS TO HIGH
RUNNING BOARDS TOO NARROW
RUNNING EVERYTHING THROUGH TOUCHSCREEN MENUS FORCES A CHOICE BETWEEN DRIVING OR ADJUSTING THE AUDIO/NAVIGATION SYSTEM CANNOT BE USED SAFELY WHILE DRIVING 
RUNNING LIGHTS
RUNNING THROUGH THE MENUS TO FIND SONGS ON MY MEMORY STICK WHILE DRIVING CAN BE A HASSLE 
RUNS AND SHIFT SO SMOOTH
RUST IN THE TAILGATE
S BETTER DISPLAY FOR THE SAT RADIO STATIONS 
SADLY DID NOT RECEIVE OWNER S MANUAL UNTIL LONG AFTER PURCHASE SO UNABLE TO TRULY UNDERSTAND OPERATING SYSTEM OF TV S
SAFE
SAFE AS CAN BE
SAFE CAR TO DRIVE

SAFE TO DRIVE GOOD VISIBILITY
SAFE TOWING
SAFE VEHICLE
SAFE VEHICLE 
SAFER THAN ANY CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED 
SAFER THAN OTHER VEHICLES
SAFEST CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN ELECTRONIC SAFETY TECH SOMETIMES GETS A BIT ANNOYING BUT HAS ITS PLACE WITH INEXPERIENCED DRIVES 
SAFEST FEELING CAR EVER HAD
SAFEST FEELING VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED
SAFEST I HAVE EVER FELT DRIVING A VEHICLE ESPECIALLY IN SNOW/ICE 
SAFEST VEHICLE I HAVE EVER DROVE HANDS DOWN
SAFEST VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED HOPE I CAN CONTINUE TO AFFORD THEM 
SAFETY
SAFETY AND EASE OF OPERATING SYNC 
SAFETY BOTH HANDS ON WHEEL WHELE TALKING ON PHONE ITS GREAT
SAFETY CONCERNS COME FROM THE TIRE WANDERING 
SAFETY DRIVING
SAFETY FEATURES
SAFETY FEATURES ARE EXCELLENT AND I HAVE ENCOUNTERED NO PROBLEMS REGARDING VISIBILITY IN ANY DRIVING CONDITION
SAFETY FEATURES ARE FULLY LOADED 
SAFETY FEATURES ARE OUTSTANDING WISH I HAD THE FULL SAFETY PACKAGE 
SAFETY FEATURES ARE SUPERB AND GIVES ME A SENSE OF COMFORT
SAFETY FEATURES ARE TOP NOTCH IT WAS A BIG SELLING POINT FOR THE VEHICLE ESPECIALLY THE NEWER SYSTEMS INCLUDING CMBS AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL VISIBILITY IS EVEN EXCEPTIONAL WITH THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM PULLED DOWN 
SAFETY FEATURES MAKE YOU FEEL SAFE SLIGHT BLIND SPOT BUT HAVE THE SYSTEM FOR THAT REALLY DO NOT NEED A HUGE REAR WINDOW HEAD LIGHTS AND VISION GREAT 
SAFETY FEATURES WAS BIG COMPONENT IN PURCHASING THE BMW
SAFETY HISTORY
SAFETY IS FINE 
SAFETY IS IMPORTANT MY WIFE EVEN LIKES TO DRIVE IT 
SAFETY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REASONS WHY I SELECTED THE VEHICLE AND IT HAS LIVED UP TO THE PROMISES
SAFETY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHEN DRIVING ANY VEHICLE THIS SONATA HAS ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURES AND MORE I FEEL VERY SECURE IN THIS CAR 
SAFETY LOCK OUT FEATURE IS BOTHERSOME
SAFETY OF BLIND SPOT
SAFETY OF SEETS
SAFETY OF USING THE HANDS FREE CALLING SOUND QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS
SAFETY RATING
SAFETY RATING FOR CLASS
SAFETY RATINGS
SAFETY RATINGS/ AIRBAGS WERE A BUYING DECISION
SAFETY STYLE SUNROOF
SAFETY SYSTEMS ARE SUPER!
SAFETY SYSTEMS WERE THE REASON I BOUGHT HE CAR!
SAFETY WAS A MAIN TOP PRIORITY IN CHOOSING THIS VEHICLE ALL WHEEL DRIVE DRIVER VISIBILITY FROM ALL ANGLES VEHICLE CLEARANCE & DRIVERS SEAT HEIGHT IIHS TOP PICK SAFETY RATING AIRBAGS INCLUDING THE KNEE AIRBAGS 
SAFETY WAS OUR TOP PRIORITY IN BUYING THIS CAR IT HAD THE BEST SAFETY FEATURES WE COULD FIND HENCE MY TRULY EXCEPTIONAL RATING 
SAFETY WHEN BACKING UP NEEDS AN UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW THAT IS EASY TO ACHIEVE THE LAST CAR I HAD WITH THAT ADVANTAGE WAS MY 1997 ESCORT 
SAFETY WHEN DRIVING IS RELEVANT TO THE ILLUMINATION OF THE WIPER/TURN SIGNAL/REAR VIEW MIRROR & INTERIOR LIGHTING I HAVE LISTED IN PREVIOUS QUESTIONS 
SAID IT WAS A 900 WATT SYSTEM YET MY 200 WATT STOCK SYSTEM IN MY SUBURBAN IS AT LEAST 30% LOUDER AND JUST AS CLEAR HAVE TO USE THE VOICE SYSTEM MORE ALL ON ME 
SALES MAN SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED HOW THESE THINGS WORK 
SAME AS BEFORE BOOK HARD TO UNDERSTAND
SAME AS MY JAG XJ AND WELL KNOWN TO JLRUSA AND THE INDUSTRY THE SYSTEM IS SLOW AND BURDENSOME
SAME COMMENT AS GIVEN EARLIER THEREIS A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT COMES WITH THE VEHICLE THAT I AM ON MY OWN TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE PROPERLY 
SAME QUALITY AS MY NEW MERCEDES E350! WISH THEY MADE THE CONTINENTAL
SAT NAV AND BLUETOOTH ARE BASIC THESE DAYS AND MAZDA IS NOT OFFERING IN THEIR BASE VARIANTS 
SAT RADIO
SAT RADIO BETTER ANTENNA
SAT RADIO INTERFACE IS CLUNKY
SAT RADIO IS TRULY OUTSTANDING DONOT NEED TO CHANGE LIKE CD
SAT RADIO RECEPTION HD RADIO RECEPTION
SAT RESPONSE AND USE
SAT/NAV IS WAY TO CUMBERSOME TO USE
SATELITE RADIO
SATELITE RADIO CONNECTION IN NOT GOOD I HAVE SATELLITE RADIO IN 2 OTHER CARS AND I DO NOT LOSE CONNECTIVITY ALSO LOSS OF CONNECTIVITY IN MKC IS TOO LONG 
SATELLITE FM & AM STATIONS CAN ALL BE PROGRAMMED INTO SAME SET OF FAVORITE STATIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO SWITCH MODES 
SATELLITE IS NICE
SATELLITE RADIO
SATELLITE RADIO 
SATELLITE RADIO AND SOUND QUALITY ARE AMAZING I THOUGHT I WOULD MISS THE CD PLAYER BUT I DON T!
SATELLITE RADIO AND SPEAKER QUALITY
SATELLITE RADIO AND VOLUME CONTROL ON STEERING WHEEL
SATELLITE RADIO CAPABILITY
SATELLITE RADIO CHOICES WITHOUT COMMERCIALS IS VERY NICE
SATELLITE RADIO CUTS OUT IN COMMERCIAL AREAS 
SATELLITE RADIO FOR VARIETY WITH NO COMMERCIALS 
SATELLITE RADIO IS A REAL PLEASURE NO MORE CDS!
SATELLITE RADIO IS FANTASTIC IT S ALL I LISTEN TO 
SATELLITE RADIO IS MUFFLED AND BLUE TOOTH IS NOT AS LOUD AND CLEAR AS RADIO
SATELLITE RADIO IS MY FAVORITE PROBLEM CAR IS SMARTER THAN I AM 
SATELLITE RADIO LETS ME LISTEN TO WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT 
SATELLITE RADIO RECEPTION IS HORRIFICALLY BAD MUCH WORSE THAN MY 10 YEAR OLD FORD THAT THIS REPLACED SYSTEM LOSES SATELLITE CONNECTION REPEATEDLY DEALER REPORTS THAT THERE IS NO FIX 
SATELLITE RADIO SEEMS TO HAVE REDUCED SOUND FIDELITY 
SATELLITE RADIO SHOULD BE A STANDARD OPTION
SATELLITE RADIO SHOULD BE STANDARD AND THE SPEAKERS SHOULD BE UPGRADED 
SATELLITE RADIO SOUND QUALITY IS HORRIBLE AS COMPARED TO CDS OR IPOD SOURCES 
SATELLITE RADIO THAT CAN TAKE PLACE FOR ANY OTHER ENTERTAINMENT CD
SATELLITE RADIO WAS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE CAR VERY MUCH MISSED!
SATELLITE SYSTEM
SATELLITE TRAFFIC IS A SEPARATE APP FROM THE NAVIGATION APP AS A RESULT IT S PRETTY MUCH USELESS IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE USEFUL IF THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM REFERENCED THE SATELLITE TRAFFIC WHEN DETERMINING ROUTE TO AVOID TRAFFIC AT THE V 
SATELLITE VIEW IN NAVIGATION
SATERLITE RADIO WE DO NOT HAVE TO BUY CD 
SATILITE RADIO
SATISFACTORY
SATISFIED

SATTELITE RADIO
SATTELITE RADIO AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
SATTLELITE RADIO
SAVE CURRENT LOCATION AS AN NEW FAVORITE
SAVE ON FUEL COST
SAVING FAVORITES SHOULD ALLOW MIXING BANDS
SCAN FEATURE FOR FM/AM RADIO IS CONFUSING 
SCANNING AND SETTING FM/AM ARE DIFFICULT I COULDN T DO THAT WITHOUT A SPECIFICATION 
SCANNING THRU RADIO CHANNELS SOMEWHAT CUMBERSOME ASSIGNING RADIO CHANNELS A BIT COMPLICATED USB PORT DOES NOT EASILY READ MUSIC
SCREEN
SCREEN APPEARANCE OPTIONS SINCE MOST OF THE TIME I USE AUDIO NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE SIMPLER TO ENTER ADDRESS 
SCREEN CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VIEW BASED ON SUN EXPOSURE 
SCREEN CAN BE HARD TO SEE IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT WITH SUNROOF OPEN
SCREEN CANNOT BE SEEN WHEN SUN ON DASH SO A VISOR OR HOOD MAY IMPROVE VISABILITY ALSO PROVIDING FOR A FINGERPRINT PROOF MATERIAL FOR THE SCREEN WOULD MINIMIZE OR ALLEVIATE HAVING TO CLEAN FINGER SMUDGES EVERY 5 10 MINUTES AFTER CHANGING CHANNELS 
SCREEN CONTROL LAYOUT
SCREEN COULD BE BIGGER MAP IS SOMETIMES HARD TO READ SEPARATE THE NAVIGATION AND RADIO 
SCREEN COULD BE CLOSER TO DRIVER AS I CANNOT READ IT AND IT IS ONLY READ BY MY WIFE WHEN SHE IS RIDING WITH ME 
SCREEN COULD BE LARGER
SCREEN COULD BE LARGER AND HIGHER RESOLUTION SOUND WAS MEDIOCRE 
SCREEN COULD BE LARGER AND IT S MISSING LOT OF ADDRESSES OR SO IT SEEMS DIFFICULT TO ENTER ADDRESSES 
SCREEN COULD BE LARGER AND MORE ATTRACTIVE VERY BLAND COMPARED TO PREVIOUS DODGE JUST BECAUSE ITS A WORK TRUCK DOESN T MEAN CUT CORNERS IF YOU TRULY WORK YOUR TRUCK THAT MEANS YOUR IN IT FOR LONG DURATIONS SHOULD HAVE AS MANY FEATURES AND CO 
SCREEN DESIGN IS VERY POORLY DONE 
SCREEN DISPLAY COULD BE A BIT LARGER
SCREEN DISPLAY COULD BE BIGGER
SCREEN DOES NOT MANAGE GLARE WELL IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE SCREEN WHEN IT S REALLY SUNNY OUT PASSENEGER AND DRIVER 
SCREEN DOES NOT TURN OFF FAST ENOUGH VOICE COMMANDS SLOW 
SCREEN DOESN T ALWAYS RECOGNIZE A TOUCH 
SCREEN EASIER TO READ WHILE DRIVING
SCREEN FLOW
SCREEN FOR NAVIGATION IS TRULY UNIQUE IN SIZE
SCREEN GET SMUDGED VERY EASILY
SCREEN GETS DARK WITH SUNLIGHT
SCREEN GRAPHIC
SCREEN GRAPHICS
SCREEN GRAPHICS COULD BE IMPROVED/UPDATED
SCREEN HARD TO SEE IN THE SUN
SCREEN HAS DELAY WHEN TOUCHING AND FINGER MUST BE EXCATLY POSITIONED 
SCREEN HAS TOO MUCH CLUTTER PRINTING TOO SMALL TO READ WHILE DRIVING TOO MUCH ACTIVITY IS CRAMMED INTO AN AUTOMOTIVE UNIT MOST OF THE DRIVERS ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE TECHNOLOGY 
SCREEN INTERFACE AND CONTROL
SCREEN IS A BIT BUSY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON ONE OR TWO ITEMS THAT YOU USE ALL THE TIME INSTEAD OF HAVING ALL OF THEM THERE EVERY TIME 
SCREEN IS A BIT SMALL 
SCREEN IS A BIT SMALL NOT USER FRIENDLY USER INTERFACE / COMMAND TREE 
SCREEN IS BEAUTIFUL AND CALLS ARE CRYSTAL CLEAR 
SCREEN IS BUSY NOT AS LARGE AS OUR ACURA AND THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS CLUTTERED WITH ICONS I D LIKE TO SEE A LESS BUSY SCREEN 
SCREEN IS EASY TO USE AND NAVIGATE
SCREEN IS EXCELLENT SIZE AND VERY EASY TO USE
SCREEN IS HARD TO MANEUVER AT TIMES
SCREEN IS JUMBLED XM INTERFACE A LITTLE CONFUSING TO FIND STATIONS 
SCREEN IS LARGE AND SET BACK INTO DASH DEEPER THAN MOST MAKING IT EASY TO SEE 
SCREEN IS REALLY JUST A BIT TOO SMALL FOR EASE OF USE AND GLANCING AT MAP WHILST DRIVING 
SCREEN IS TOO LARGE AND WOULD BE BETTER IN THE DASH RATHER THAN ABOVE IT SOUND QUALITY IS SUBPAR
SCREEN IS TOO SMALL
SCREEN IS TOO SMALL NAVIGATION IS NOT USER FRIENDLY ON MANY ISSUES
SCREEN IS VERY SMALL FOR THE SIZE OF THIS VEHICLE SEEMS SO FAR AWAY FROM DRIVER SO THERE IS A HUGE GLARE MAKING IT HARD TO SEE SINCE IT IS SO FAR AWAY FROM DRIVER
SCREEN IS VERY VERY HARD TO SEE DURING DAYTIME DUE TO GLARE 
SCREEN LAYOUT
SCREEN NEEDS MORE DETAIL ESPECIALLY WHEN ZOOMING OUT STREETS DISAPPEAR MAKING ZOOM OUT USELESS 
SCREEN NEEDS UPDATING
SCREEN OFF NEEDS TO BE DONE EACH TIME THE CAR IS STARTED THIS SHOULD REMEMBER THAT THE SCREEN WAS OFF WHEN THE CAR WAS SHUT DOWN AND RETAIN THAT SETTING RATHER THAN NEEDING TO TURN OFF THE SCREEN EVERYTIME THE CAR IS STARTED 
SCREEN ON MAP IS MORE TOUCHY THAN THE ONE ON MY PREVIOUS PRIUS
SCREEN ON RADIO IS SMALL DOESN T GIVE MUCH PROGRAMMING INFO
SCREEN RESOLUTION
SCREEN RESOLUTION IS NOT VERY GOOD COMPARED TO TODAY S SCREENS FOUND ON THINGS LIKE PHONES AND IPADS YOU NEED HIGHER DPI SCREENS WITH HIGHER RESOLUTION GRAPHICS AND SMOOTHER ANIMATIONS IT LOOKS LIKE A 5 10 YEAR OLD COMPUTER SYSTEM THE NAVIGATIO 
SCREEN RESOLUTION IS SUB PAR MORE PHONE INTEGRATION FEATURES DESIRED LIKE SHOWING TEXT MESSAGES ON SCREEN WHEN READ ETC 
SCREEN RESOLUTION IS TOO LOW NEEDS A HIGHER RES SCREEN
SCREEN SHOULD BE HIGHER AND VOICE RECOGNITION IMPROVED 
SCREEN SHOULD BE IN FRONT OF STEERING WHEEL
SCREEN SHOULD NOT BE ORANGE LIGHT COLOR IT SHOULD BE A BLUE OR RED A COLOR THAT IS MORE AT EASE FOR THE EYE
SCREEN SIZE
SCREEN SIZE AND IMPROVED MAPS OVER PREVIOUS MERCEDES NAV SYSTEMS 
SCREEN SIZE IS SUFFICIENT FOR SIZE OF CAR 
SCREEN SIZE TOO SMALL
SCREEN SLANT IS TOO MUCH TOO FAR TO REACH UGLY DISPLAY THAT IS SEEMS CHEAP FOR TOYOTA BRAND 
SCREEN THAT POPS IN AND OUT FROM DASHBOARD IS A BIG PLUS AND THAT IS A STAND OUT FEATURE FROM OTHER CARS
SCREEN TOO SMALL ESPECIALLY FOR NAVIGATION
SCREEN TOO SMALL LACKS FEATURES OF DODGE JOURNEY GPS AS TO GRAPHICS SPEED ZONES ZERO IN LOCATIONS 
SCREEN USAGE FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM TOO MUCH SPACE IS TAKEN UP BY THE SIGNS OF THE NEXT TURN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET RID OF THOSE TEMPORARILY SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU RE GOING THE YOU ARE HERE ARROW SHOULD HAVE AN OPTION TO HAVE THAT AT TH 
SCREEN VERY VISIBLE EVEN IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT 
SCREENS AND SCREEN SELECTIONS COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE SOMETIMES HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH SEVERAL SCREENS TO GET SPECIFIC INFO 
SCREENS ARE BIG AND EASY TO USE 
SCREENS ARE SO EASY TO READ AND USE EVEN IN BRIGHT SUN
SCREWS BOWING ON FLOORBOARDS 
SCROLL SKIPPING PROBLEM 
SCROLLING IS NOT RESPONSIVE TO TOUCH 
SCROLLING THROUGH ALL THE SATELLITE CHANNELS TAKES A LOT OF TIME YOU CAN PROGRAM 10 STATIONS INTO THE RADIO PRESENT STATION BUTTONS BUT IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU COULD JUMP FROM A FULL SCREEN TO THE NEXT FULL SCREEN RATHER THAN GOING ONE BY ONE 
SCROLLING THROUGH IPOD ARTISTS/ALBUMS ETC IS CUMBERSOME WOULD BE NICE TO EASILY TO LEAP TO LETTERS FURTHER DOWN THE ALPHABET 
SCROLLING THROUGH RADIO PRESETS
SD CARD
SD CARD FOR MUSIC IT S THE BEST 
SD CARD INTERFACE IS AWFUL 
SD CARD MUSIC PLAY
SD CARDS ARE OUTDATED SHOULD HAVE BEEN USB PORTS IN A 2015 NEEDS BETTER CONNECTIVITY WITH IPHONE MEDIA

SEAMLESS BLUETOOTH PAIRING WITH MY CELLPHONE AND GREAT SOUND QUALITY 
SEAMLESS INTEGRATION 
SEAMLESS INTEGRATION AND EASY OPERATION OF MY WINDOWS PHONE AND MY WIFE S IPHONE 
SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF PHONE FUNCTIONS WITH CAR
SEARCHING FOR SPECIFIC STORES IS NOT EASY I E THE CATEGORY SYSTEM IS POOR IT SEEMS AS IF YOU HAVE TO TYPE IN THE FULL NAME WHICH IS TEDIOUS AND DONE MUCH BETTER DIRECTLY THROUGH THE IPHONE 
SEARCHING POINT OF INTEREST IN OTHER LOCATIONS BESIDES CURRENT LOCATION APPS ARE NOT VERY ISSUE TO USE

SEATS AREN T AS COMFORTABLE
SEATS COULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE
SEATS FOLD DOWN FLAT
SEATS MANUAL NOT EASY TO ADJUST
SEATS NEED IMPROVEMENT
SEATS SEEM TO SIT LOW EVEN WHEN ADJUSTED TO THEIR FULL HEIGHT IT IS A LEARNING CURVE TO ADAPT TO HOW FAR TO PULL IN TO A PARKING SPOT SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT I ALSO FIND IT DIS CONCERNING TH 
SEATS SIT LOW AND IT MAKES IT A BIT HARD TO SEE THE FRONT AND SIDES OF THE VEHICLE WHEN YOUR NAVIGATING TIGHT SPOTS ALSO THE SIDE WINDSHIELD PANEL IS THICK AND ANGLED SO THAT IT CREATES A BLIND SPOT WHEN YOU ARE TURNING A CORNER 
SEATS TEND TO DIRTY EASILY
SEATS UNCOMFORTABLE
SECOND AND THIRD ROW SEAT HEADRESTS LIMIT REAR VISIBILITY
SECOND BEST BUYING DECISION IN MY LIFE GETTING STI NUMBER 1 WAS BUYING HOUSE
SECOND HEAD UNIT GOING IN A WEEK TRUCK HAS 1400 MILES ON IT

SEEING OUT OF BACK WINDOW
SEEING OUT OF CORNOR OF FRONT WINDOWS

SEEING OUT OF REAR WINDOW IS A LITTLE ANNOYING DUE TO HIGH HEADRESTS ON SEATS I AM ADJUSTING TO IT HOWEVER NOT A MAJOR CONCERN 
SEEING OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW IS FINE THE SIDE WINDOWS ARE LITTLE SMALL THERE IS A SMALL BLINDSPOT 
SEEING OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW
SEEING OUT OF THE SIDE OR BACK OF THE VEHICLE FROM DRIVER SEAT IS WEAK FORWARD VIEWS AND LANE CHANGING TECHNOLOGY IS GOOD AND HELPS MAKE UP FOR THE TERRIBLE VISIBILITY

SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING UP AT THE REAR DOORS 
SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT I DON T USE LIKE WI FI I AM DRIVING I DON T NEED MY CAR TO BE A HOT SPOT SATELLITE RADIO IS A WASTE FOR ME SINCE I DON T TRAVEL LONG MILES ON A REGULAR BASIS THE HANDS FREE WORKED WHEN I GOT THE C 
SEEMS LIKE THERE IS QUITE A DELAY WHEN I PICK UP THE CALL FROM MY STEERING WHEEL I M LIKE HELLO? HELLO? WASN T THIS WAY IN MY VELOSTER

SELDOM USE SUBJECT SYSTEMS 
SELDOM USED 
SELECT BUTTONS COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER US OLDER FOLKS DO HAVE SMALL FINGER TIPS
SELECTED 3 BUT WON T ACCEPT
SELECTED THE CAR BECAUSE I FELT I COULD SEE WELL WHEN DRIVING I COULD ACTUALLY SEE WHERE THE FRONT END OF THE CAR WAS WHEN DRIVING AND PARKING THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS WERE ALSO AN ESSENTIAL WHEN I WAS PICKING THE CAR 
SELECTING A RADIO STATION OR SELECTING A PERSON TO CALL IS DIFFICULT TO OPERATE WHILE DRIVING BORDERING ON UNSAFE AS IT REQUIRES MORE ATTENTION THAN IT SHOULD A DISTRACTION 
SELECTING AND ADJUSTING FEATURES IS TOO COMPLEX WAY TOO MUCH TO HANDLE WHEN DRIVING ALL BUT BASIC CONTROLS SHOULD BE LOCKED OUT WHEN CAR IS MOVING

SETTING A DESTINATION
SETTING A DESTINATION CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND CONFUSING FOR EXAMPLE IF AN ADDRESS IS LOCATED JUST OUTSIDE OF CITY LIMITS THE SYSTEM WON T LIST IT UNLESS YOU BACK UP THE PROMPTS AND CHANGE TO THE COUNTY NAME WHICH YOU MAY NOT RECOGNIZE 
SETTING A DESTINATION IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE 
SETTING A NAVIGATION SYSTEM REFERENCE POINT COULD BE EASIER 
SETTING CRUISE CONTROL
SETTING FM RADIO STATIONS
SETTING OF RADIO STATIONS VERY DIFFICULT !!!
SETTING STATIONS ON RADIO SYSTEM SEEMS MORE COMPLICATED TO OPERATE THAN OUR 2011 AVALON 
SETTING THE CLOCK SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE EASIER MAYBE THIS COMMENT BELONGS IN A DIFFERENT AREA 
SETTING THE PRESET STATIONS 
SETTING UP AND SAVING CHANNELS WAS CONFUSING
SETTING UP AUDIO TO PLAY FROM ANDROID PHONE APPS TO CAR SPEAKERS COULD BE A LOT BETTER 
SETTING UP FAVORITE RADIO STATIONS 
SETTING UP FEATURES REQUIRES NAVIGATION THRU MULTIPLE MENUS

SINC SYSTEM
SINCE CAR IS ONLY 4 MONTHS OLD I HAVE NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SEVERAL OF THE OPTIONS I DID NOT TRAVEL IN THE FIRST 3 MONTHS SO ON STAR WAS NOT USED I DO NOT USE THE HANDS FREE PHONE APPLICATION I LOVE SIRIUS/XM RADIO BUT WISH THE RULES FOR IT 
SINCE I AM SHORT THE BAR IN FRONT THAT GOES FROM THE CEILING TO THE DOOR WITH THE RIGHT REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS LARGE AND BLOCKS MY VIEW AT INTERSECTIONS 
SINCE I BOUGHT IT NEW THE WIPERS SHOULD CLEAR BETTER 
SINCE I CAN T USE THE BLUETOOTH WITH MY IPHONE THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE I REALLY DON T USE IT I LIKE THE SATELLITE RADIO BUT I DON T KNOW IF I WILL PAY FOR A SUBSCRIPTION WHEN THE TRIAL IS OVER I WISH I COULD USE MY IPOD VIA BLUETOOTH 
SINCE I CANNOT SEE THE FRONT OF THE CAR WHEN DRIVING I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PULL UP TO THE CURB OR PULL INTO A PARKING SPACE WITHOUT HITTING THE CONCRETE BUMP WHEN PULLING UP TO A CURB I DO NOT WANT TO HIT THE CURB WITH MY TIRE BUT SINCE I 
SINCE I CANNOT SIT UP AS HIGH AS I WANT THE SEAT ONLY GOES SO HIGH I DO NOT HAVE THE VISIBILITY THAT I WOULD WANT ALSO THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS OBSTRUCT MY SIDE VISION THERE ARE STILL BLIND SPOTS THAT I NEED TO USE THE WARNING BLIND SPOT INDICAT 
SINCE I DISCOVERED THAT CAN TILT THE BACKSEAT HEADRESTS WHEN THEIR ARE NO PASSENGERS IT MAKE FOR MUCH BETTER VISION 
SINCE I DO NOT TEST I RELY ON THE BLUE TOOTH FOR ANY COMMUNICATION WHILE DRIVING 
SINCE I DON T HAVE XM RADIO TRIAL PERIOD OVER I WOULD RATHER NOT HIT ON XM RADIO AT ALL WHEN I USE THE SOURCE FEATURE 
SINCE I DON T USE MOST OF THE FEATURES I CAN T COMPARE AND THEREFORE I HAVE NO OPINION 
SINCE I DRIVE SHORT DISTANCES LOCALLY I FEEL LESS SECURE ABOUT LANE CHANGES I FEEL THAT I HAVE BLIND SPOTS AND NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL BECAUSE THE CAR HAS A LOW PROFILE 
SINCE I HAVE A LONG TORSO VISIBILITY WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME IF THE SEATS COULD LOWER EVEN MORE 
SINCE I HAVE THE SEAT ALL THE WAY BACK I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING CARS ON THE LEFT SIDE WHEN MERGING ONTO HIGHWAY AND WHEN CHANGING LANES 
SINCE I HAVE TO MOVE THE SEAT SO FAR FORWARD VISIBILITY IS POOR 
SINCE I LISTEN TO MY IPOD THE MOST WHEN I CONNECTED THROUGH THE USB PORT I WOULD LIKE THE SYSTEM TO WORK LIKE MY IPOD DOES FOR EXAMPLE I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH MY WHOLE SONG LIST USING THE CONTROLS ON MY CAR BECAUSE IT TAKES TOO 
SINCE I PURCHASE MUCH OF MY MUSIC THROUGH ITUNES IT IS AWESOME TO HAVE AN ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM THAT CAN PLAY M4A FILES FROM A USB STICK WITHOUT REQUIRING ME TO CONVERT EVERYTHING TO MP3 JUST FOR USE IN MY CAR 
SINCE IT HAS A BACKUP CAMERA I DON T HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE VISIBILITY 
SINCE IT IS A MEGA CAB IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A CAMERA VIEW OF THE CARGO AREA TO ENSURE EVERYTHING IS SECURE WHEN DRIVING AND HAULING CARGO IN THE BED 
SINCE IT IS SPORTY MADE THE REAR VISIBILITY IS QUIET LESS FROM THE ANGLED REAR SCREEN WHICH MAKES SOMETIME LITTLE SCARY CHANGING LANES ON FAST HIGHWAYS 
SINCE IT S A SMALL CONVERTIBLE MANNY TIMES LARGER TRUCKS AND VEHICLES DON T SEE MY CAR
SINCE MOST OF OUT MUSIC IS PURCHASED FROM THE ITUNES STORE THE ABILITY TO PLAY M4A FILES FROM A USB DRIVE IS AWESOME! NO LONGER DO WE HAVE TO RE RIP EVERYTHING AS MP3 FILES JUST FOR USE IN THE CAR 
SINCE MY CAR IS A CABRIOLET CONVERTIBLE THE VISION THRU THE REAR WINDOW IS NOT VERY GOOD 
SINCE MY REAR CAMERA IS NOT OPTIMAL REVERSING IS NOT SAFE 
SINCE NO ONE SHOWED US HOW TO USE THE VOICE ACTIVATED FEATURES AND I VE BEEN TOO BUSY TO PULL OUT THE INSTRUCTIONS WE HAVEN T USED IT 
SINCE OWNING THIS VEHICLE I HAVE GONE OVER A FEW SIDEWALKS AND CURBS I M UNABLE TO SEE THE ENTIRE HOOD SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THE VEHICLE IS TOO LOW 
SINCE REAR CAMERAS BEGAN APPEARING IN CARS THE VISABILITY FROM REAR WINDOWN HAS DECLINED I PURCHASED THE KIA SOUL BECAUSE I WANT TO USE MY EYES ASWELL AS THE REAR CAMERA 
SINCE THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK IT IS HARD TO COMMENT UNTIL IT IS FIXED AND HOPEFULLY LASTS 
SINCE THE CAR HAS VERY BAD BLIND SPOTS THE BLIND SPOT AND CHANGE LANE FEATURE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON THIS CAR BUT IT IS NOT 
SINCE THE CAR IS HIGHER UP THAN I M USED TOO I FOUND THE BLIND SPOTS MORE DIFFICULT TO CORRECT 
SINCE THE CAR IS NOT EQUIPPED WITH REAR CAMERA IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE BEHIND 
SINCE THE SNOW AND FREEZING WEATHER MY BACK WIPERS WILL NOT SPRAY THE WASHER FLUID
SINCE THE VEHICLE S STYLING LIMITS THE REAR VISIBILITY THE BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY USEFUL I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE SELECTED THAT OPTION BUT AM VERY GLAD THE VEHICLE CAME WITH IT ANYWAY 
SINCE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY BAD WHEN ENTERING NAVIGATION DESTINATIONS AND THE SYSTEM CAN T BE MANUALLY USED WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD CONSIDER ALLOWING THE SYSTEM TO BE MANUALLY ACCESSED WHILE MOVING IF THERE IS 
SINCE THERE IS A VISIBILITY PROBLEM WITH MIRRORS IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF IT HAD LANE DEPARTURE TECH INCLUDED
SINCE THEY HAVE MADE THE BACK WINDOW SMALLER SOME TROUBLE SEEING OUT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE BACK UP CAMERA 
SINCE THIS IS SUCH A LONG VEHICLE YOU NEED TO IMPROVE SIGHT RANGE OUT SIDE OF CAR ESPECIALLY WHEN CHANGING LANES I ALMOST HIT A LOW 2 SEATER CONVERTIBLE IN THE LANE NEXT TO ME BECAUSE HE WAS SO LOW I COULDN T SEE HIM DOWN THERE GREATER VISI 
SINCE WE HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I DID NOT WANT TO RATE IT HOWEVER BEFORE I COULD CONTINUE WITH THE SURVEY I WAS FORCED TO RATE THE SYSTEM 
SINCE WE TRAVEL A LOT IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THEY ARE THERE IF NEEDED
SINCE YOU DO NOT HANDLE TEXT BY AUDIO I TRY IPHONE TEXT/MICROPHONE BUT ONCE PAIRED TO TRUCK THAT MICROPHONE NOR THE TRUCKS MICROPHONE SEEMS TO WORKS FOR THAT PURPOSE 
SINCE YOU MENTIONED IT I DO FIND THE VISORS TO BE SMALL 
SINGLE CD PLAYER
SINGLE KNOB CONTROL TOOK A WHILE TO MASTER BUT IS NOW EASY AND QUICK TO USE

STARLINK IS A LITTLE SLOW WHEN TOUCHING AND SELECTING OPTIONS

STEERING WHEEL CONTROL ARE VERY LIMITED IN FUNCTIONALITY CANNOT USE THESE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH MENUS SETTING ADDRESS IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TEDIOUS OVERALL INTEGRATION OF AUDIO SYSTEM NAVIGATION AND VEHICLE INFO IS NOT GOOD MAY BE I FELT THIS 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROL DESIGN
STEERING WHEEL CONTROL FOR ANSWERING PHONE IS APPRECIATED
STEERING WHEEL CONTROL OF AUDIO SYSTEMS IS EASY AND CONVENIENT 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROL OF VOLUME AND STATION SELECTION
STEERING WHEEL CONTROL THAT CONTROLS SOURCE AND ALLOWS YOU TOGGLE UP OR DOWN TO SELECT THE NEXT OR PREVIOUS FAVORITE RADIO STATION USB FILE IPOD ETC IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN TRYING TO SELECT NEXT/PREVIOUS SELECTIONS IT SHOULD BE THE SAME AS 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS A PLUS TOUCH SCREEN A BIT FAR AWAY FROM ME DRIVER S SEAT BUT I DON T HAVE THE LONGEST ARMS EITHER 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ALLOW EASY USAGE WHILE DRIVING
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ALONG WITH TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS VOICE COMMANDS AND THE EXCELLENT SPEAKER SYSTEM THAT IS FACTORY INSTALLED I AM A HUGE MUSIC LOVER THIS IS A KEY ITEM WHEN DECIDING ON A VEHICLE 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS AND TOUCH SCREEN 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE FORGETTABLE ONCE YOU GET TO THE SCREEN YOU NEED IT CHANGES QUICKLY BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SCREEN 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE SLOW TO CHANGE RADIO STATIONS 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE THEY NEED TO BE ON THE FRONT OF THE WHEEL NOT THE BACK 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE VERY GOOD MAKING IT EASY TO USE THESE SYSTEMS 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS CAN T CHANGE FM STATIONS FROM WHEEL POOR MARKING FOR PHONE FUNCTIONS
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS COULD BE BETTER LAID OUT TOO EASY TO BUMP MEDIA MODES WHEN ADJUSTING VOLUME 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS COULD BE SLEEKER THEY STICK OUT A BIT TO FAR AND CAN BE HIT BY ACCIDENT WHILE TURNING 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS LOVE THEM ALTHOUGH BEING ABLE TO SCAN CHANNELS MANUALLY ON THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD BE NICE 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS NOT NEEDED
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS NOT USE FRIENDLY
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM AND NAVIGATION SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE IN ALL MODELS 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ONLY USEFUL ON STRAIGHT ROADS TURNING WHEEL RENDERS IT USELESS THEN MUST USE CENTER CONTROLS WHICH ARE TOO DISTRACTING FROM DRIVING CAN STEERING WHEEL CONTROL BE MADE SEPARATE AND STATIONARY NON TURNING IN SAME LOCATIO 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO CHANGE STATIONS 
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO CHANGE STATIONS IS DIFFICULT 
STEERING WHEEL CRUISE CONTROL BUTTONS TOO LOW ON STEERING WHEEL MY 2014 FUSION ENERGI HAS CONTROLS IN THE PERFECT PLACE
STEERING WHEEL DESIGN OBSCURES VISIBILITY OF PORTIONS OF DASH IN SOME POSITIONS 
STEERING WHEEL MOUNTED AUDIO CONTROLS WOULD BE NICE 
STEERING WHEEL MOUNTED CONTROL TO SKIP FORWARD AND BACK ON IPHONE MUSIC
STEERING WHEEL MUSIC CONTROL
STEERING WHEEL NOT ADJUSTABLE
STEERING WHEEL NOT THICK ENOUGH
STEERING WHEEL PLACEMENT AND ADJUSTMENT POORLY DESIGNED
STEERING WHEEL POSITION
STEERING WHEEL RADIO CONTROL TO CHANGE STATIONS
STEERING WHEEL RADIO CONTROLS BEHIND WHEEL COULD BE EASIER TO FEEL WHILE DRIVING KNOBS NOT BIG ENOUGH TO EASILY FEEL
STEERING WHEEL RADIO CONTROLS REQUIRE TWO 2 FUNCTIONS TO CHANGE THE CHANNELS FIRST ONE DISPLAYS THE CHANNEL AND THEN USING THE THUMBWHEEL ONE CAN CHANGE THE CHANNEL REQUIRING ONE TO TAKE HIS EYES OFF OF THE ROAD SHOULD BE ONE UP OR DOWN FUNCTION 
STEERING WHEEL SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED ABILITY TO CHANGE SONGS ALSO IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE TOUCHSCREEN SHOWED ALBUM ART AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE SONG AND ARTIST INSTEAD IT SHOWS THE SAME GENERIC BLUETOOTH SYMBOL FOR EVERY SONG 
STEERING WHEEL SLIPPERY
STEERING WHEEL TELEPHONE BUTTONS ARE CONFUSING 
STEERING WHEEL VOLUME AND CHANNEL CONTROLS ARE ON BACKSIDE OF WHEEL COULD THEY BE POSITIONED ON THE FRONT SIDE OR TOP OF SPOKE SO THEY CAN BE SEEN?
STEERING WHEEL VOLUME CONTROL SLIPPERY NOT WELL DEFINED NOT GOOD WITH AVE/MED LENGTH FINGERNAILS I OFTEN HONK MY HORN TRYING TO ADJUST VOLUME 
STEERING WHEELS VIBRATES WHEN SWITCHING LANES WITHOUT TURN SIGNAL
STEERING WILL FUNCTIONALITY
STEERING/BRAKING RESPONSIVENESS
STEERING/HANDLING
STEERS BEAUTIFULLY 
STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS 
STEP BY STEP ROUTE DIRECTIONS CAN ONLY BE SEEN AT THE START OF A ROUTE IT WOULD BE GOOD TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE NEXT TURNS CONTINUALLY THE TIMING OF TELLING WHERE THE DESTINATION RIGHT SIDE OR LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD SHOULD BE EARLIER 
STEP IN HEIGHT
STEP IS STRANGE/ TOO SHALLOW
STEP UP HEIGHT TO ENTER VEHICLE
STEREO
STEREO AND SPEAKERS ARE THAT OF A MUCH CHEAPER VEHICLE BUT VERY MUCH NOT IMPORTANT COMPARED TO THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE
STEREO CAN USE MORE POWER
STEREO DOESN T SOUND THAT GOOD!!! { SPEAKERS POOR QUALITY }
STEREO EQUALIZER FEATURE

STEREO SPEAKERS ARE VERY AVERAGE NEED TO IMPROVE
STEREO SYSTEM
STEREO SYSTEM ALTHOUGH JUST THE BASIC NON UPGRADED VERSION IS WONDERFUL! �ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE CAR THAT SAID IT IS ROUGH THAT THE SYSTEM WILL NOT DISPLAY THE RADIO STATION NAME AND FREQUENCY CONSISTENTLY IN SOME OF THE DISPLAYS IF 
STEREO SYSTEM AND SPEAKERS COULD BE LOUDER
STEREO SYSTEM IS VERY DISAPPOINTING FOR A $100K+ VEHICLE SOUND QUALITY SPEAKERS RATTLE DOES NOT HANDLE BASS ETC 
STEREO SYSTEM NOT LOUD ENOUGH
STEREO SYSTEM SPEAKERS ARE ANEMIC NEED MORE SPEAKERS IN VEHICLE LIKE THE TOYOTA VENZA JBL SYSTEM 
STEREO SYSTEM WORKS REALLY WELL
STEREOSYSTEM IS VERY WEAK CAN T GET ENOUGH VOLUME AUDIO QUALITY IS MEDIOCRE 
STERIO AND COMMUNICATION PACKAGE

STILL WORKING WITH IT
STOCK FACTORY HEADLIGHTS ARE TOO WEAK I ALREADY REPLACED MINE
STOCK HEADLIGHTS ARE A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN 
STOCK HEADLIGHTS ARE TERRIBLE
STOCK SPEAKERS ARE A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR SUCH AN EXPENSIVE VEHICLE 
STOCK SPEAKERS ARE HORRID
STOCK SPEAKERS ARE PAPER THIN
STOCK SPEAKERS ARE WEAK BUT THAT IS EXPECTED IN STOCK THE EQ CONTROL ALSO LACKS IN AUDIO CUSTOMIZATION 
STOCK SPEAKERS AREN T VERY GOOD SERIOUSLY LACKING IN THE MIDRANGE 
STOCK SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER COULD BE A LITTLE EASIER TRYING TO CONNECT A PHONE TO THE SYSTEM 
STOCK SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER QUALITY 
STOCK SPEAKERS SOUND TERRIBLE UPGRADED TO AFTERMARKET SPEAKER SYSTEM
STOCK WINDSHIELD WIPERS SEEM TO BE OF LOW QUALITY 
STOP START IGNITION FEATURE
STOP THE VIBRATION THAT COMES FROM EITHER THE DOORS OR THE SPEAKER AT HIGHER VOLUMES THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IF THE BASE IS SET TO ZERO 
STOP/START FEATURE

STORAGE
STORAGE AND CUP HOLDERS
STORAGE AREAS
STORAGE FOR CD S
STORAGE FOR THE RECHARGING CABLE IS TOO TIGHTLY MOLDED OR DESIGNED TO FIT THE FACTORY SEALED DESIGN ONCE YOU USE IT IT DOESN T WANT TO SIT NICE IN THERE AN I AM WORRIED ABOUT IT GETTING DAMAGED BEING DOWN BY PEOPLE S FEET LOCATION IS CONVENIENT
STORAGE IN BACK
STORAGE IN BED
STORAGE IN VEHICLE
STORAGE OPTIONS
STORAGE PLACE FOR LOOSE CHANGE
STORAGE SPACE
STORAGE SYNC
STORAGE/CARGO SPACE
STORE MANUAL EQUALIZER SETTING FOR EACH PUSH BUTTON SELECTION REGARDLESS OF BAND 
STORE THE DISPLAY SCREEN WHEN PARKED
STORING ADDRESSES THAT I VE ENTERED ALREADY AND LINKING THEM TO CONTACTS ON IPHONE YOU CAN DO IT BUT WHEN I GO TO USE SEEMS I NEED TO REENTER THE ADDRESS
STORING AND RECALLING PERSONAL POI IS DIFFICULT AND AWKWARD AS MENTIONED EARLIER HAVING TO PAY FOR MAP AND TRAFFIC UPGRADES IS EXPENSIVE I CAN USE MY GARMIN WITH LIFETIME UPDATES FOR FREE THE GARMIN COST ME $120 THE CAR COST ME $38 000 SAME W 
STORING DESTINATIONS IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT COMPARED TO A GARMIN PORTABLE GPS 
STORING OF WIFI INFO ON BOARD IT SEEMS TO LOSE DATA WHEN SOFTWARE GETS AN UPDATE PUT INFO IN A SECURE FILE IN THE UNIT 
STORING PREVIOUS DESTINATIONS WOULD HAVE PREFERRED KNOBS SWITCHES AND PRESETS TO TOUCH SCREEN WHICH I FIND IRRITATING TO USE CUE IS NOT USER FRIENDLY PRACTICALLY REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE A CO PILOT TO OPERATE SHOULDN T BE USED WHILE DRIVING 
STORING RADIO STATIONS AND TUNING THE FM RADIO IS UNINTUITIVE 
STREAM MUSIC
STREAM MUSIC FROM PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH 
STREAMING AUDIO FROM MY IPHONE BASICALLY NEVER WORKS THIS IS TRUE OVER BT OR USB AND FOR THE BUILT IN APPS RADIOPUP ETC THAT USE THE PHONE 
STREAMING AUDIO OVER BLUETOOTH PHONE NEEDS TO CONNECT WHEN STARTING CAR NOT SEVERAL MINUTES LATER AUDIO STREAMING SHOULD START UP IMMEDIATELY AND PICK UP WHERE LEFT OFF NOT SWITCH THE RADIO BACK TO AM/FM WHERE THE VOLUME IS NOW WAY TOO LOUD 
STREAMING BLUETOOTH AUDIO REALLY SHOULD BE AVAILABLE SEPARATELY FROM A NAVIGATION MMI PACKAGE THIS IS 2015 
STREAMING IS GREAT NAV IS EASY TO USE
STREAMING MUSIC FROM MY PHONE WITHOUT WIRES 
STREAMING MUSIC LIKE TO HEAR DIFFERENT GENERE OF MUSIC WHEN I DRIVE
STREAMING VIA BLUETOOTH AND WIFI
STREET MAPS AND BLUETOOTH PHONE LINK 
STREET NAMES ON THE MAP ARE TOO SMALL FOR THIS OLDER DRIVER TO READ EVEN WITH MY READING GLASSES ON THIS IS A NEW PROBLEMS THAT WAS NOT EVIDENT ON MY 2005 OR 2010 PRIUS S

STYLING
STYLING AND EASE OF USE I KNOW IT SAYS TO CHOOSE ONLY ONE BUT IT IS A DEADLOCK TIE THE STYLING IS MEDIOCRE AND I STILL CAN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE PANDORA OTHER THAN USING IT FROM MY PHONE NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY 
STYLING COMPROMISES THE REARWARD VISIBILITY UNDERSTAND THAT AND CAN LIVE WITH THAT OVERALL VISIBILITY IS GREAT SIDE VIEW MIRRORS PROVIDE SURPRISINGLY GOOD REARWARD VIEW LIKE THE RECTANGULAR SHAPE 
STYLING EXTERIOR/INTERIOR
STYLING FUNCTIONALITY OF MINVAN WITH LOOK OF SUV
STYLING OF ALL WINDOWS PLACES THE BAR BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR WINDOW IN MY SIGHTLINE WHEN LOOKING TO SIDE TO CHANGE LANES REAR ADJUSTED WELL BUT WHEN DOUBLE CHECKING BY TURN HEAD OR USING REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT SEPARATION BAR BETWEEN WINDOWS 
STYLING WHILE ATTRACTIVE DOES AFFECT VISIBILITY 
STYLISH YET SIMPLE TO USE
SU VISORS ARE TERRIBLE NOT LIGHTED SHORT AND THEY DON T TELESCOPE TO COVER LIGHT COMING IN THE SIDE WINDOWS 
SUB WOOFER NEEDS MOVED
SUB WOOFER WOULD BE NICE
SUBARU COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB ON THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM 
SUBARU HAS NO COMPETITION IN VEHICLE VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT 
SUBARU I LOVE YOUR CARS BUT I AM AN AUDIOPHILE PLEASE PUT IN A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM THE POOR QUALITY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM IS COMMENTED ON IN HUNDREDS OF REVIEWS BY BOTH OWNERS AND PROFESSIONALS PLEASE LISTEN!
SUBARU MAKES A VERY SAFE DRIVING CAR 
SUBARU MOVING THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS TO THE DOOR PANELS AND OPENING THE USUAL MIRROR SPOT UP WITH AN EXTRA SET OF WINDOWS WAS A PLEASANT PLUS 
SUBARU S HAVE ALWAYS NEEDED A FASTER WIPER SPEED THEY STILL NEED IT 
SUBARU S STRENGTH HAS NEVER BEEN IN THE A/V DEPARTMENT 
SUBARU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER MAKING IT EASIER FOR THE DRIVER TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE INFOTAINMENT CENTER DISPLAY OFF WITHOUT HAVING TO HUNT THROUGH MENUS FOR THAT FUNCTION FOR EXAMPLE THEY COULD INCLUDE A BUTTON FOR IT IN THE MAIN SCREEN WIT 
SUBTLE DESIGN NOT TOO FLASHY AND SERVES ALL ITS PURPOSE 
SUBWOOFER AND SURROUND SOUND
SUBWOOFER IN TIRE COMPARTMENT IS GENIUS
SUBWOOFER IS MOUNTED ON THE REAR HATCH ISSUE IS THAT THE LICENSE PLATE COVER RATTLES DURING MID LEVEL VOLUME HAD TO PLACE RUBBER CUSHION IN BETWEEN LICENSE PLATE AND COVER TO REMOVE THE RATTLE 
SUBWOOFER QUALITY
SUBWOOFER SOUND AT LOWER VOLUMES
SUCH A DELAY AFTER EVERY TIME YOU TOUCH THE SCREEN SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW TAKES FOREVER FOR NAV TO START UP 
SUCH A LARGE VARIETY OF ENTERTAINMENT AND IT S EASY TO NAVIGATE FROM ONE CHOICE OF ENTERTAINMENT TO THE NEXT SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT WHETHER LISTENING TO SIRIUSXM OR ON MY IPHONE THE NAV SYSTEM HAS COME IN HANDY MANY TIMES ALREADY FROM ENTERIN 
SUCH A LARGE VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE MUCH LARGER SCREENS MOSTLY IN DASH BUT ALSO FOR REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM 
SUCH EASE & CLARITY WITH ALL SYSTEMS
SUGGEST BETTER QUALITY OF WIPER BLADES ON YOUR NEW VEHICLES
SUGGEST SUN VISOR EXTA PANEL FOR SIDE WINDOWS
SUGGEST XENON ON HIGH BEAM TOO

SUN VISORS KINDA SUCK I KNOW IT S A SMALL CAR BUT THEY COULD BE A LITTLE LONGER OR HAVE AN EXTENDER TO KEEP THE SUN OUT OF MY EYES! THEY DON T EVEN REACH THE FAR LEFT OF THE WINDSHIELD TO BLOCK THE SUN WHEN IT S IN THE CORNER
SUN VISORS LACK SIDE OUT SHADES OR OTHER MEANS TO COVER MIRROR GAPS
SUN VISORS MIGHT WORK IN SWEDEN NOT IN FLORIDA WAY TO SMALL

SURPRISED AT THE VISIBLITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT THE FIRST TIME I SAT IN IT I WAS VERY PLEASED AND CAN SEE OUT MUCH BETTER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED 
SURPRISED JUST HOW QUICKLY IT TURNS THE BACK IS AROUND CURVE/CORNER OR IN LANE CHANGE AS FAST/EASILY AS THE FRONT 
SURPRISED THAT I HAD ROOM FOR ONLY 1 DISK MY 2006 E CLASS HAD ROOM FOR 6 DISKS 
SURPRISED YOU CAN T LISTEN TO YOUR PHONE MUSIC OVER THE RADIO IN THE CAR THAT SUCKS

SUSPENSION SYSTEM SEEMS BETTER THAN IN THE PAST 
SWAGGER FACTOR
SWAY BAR DISCONNECT
SWAYING ON HIGH SPEEDS 60MPH
SWITCH BETWEEN FM AND SATELLITE NOT AS SMOOTH AS PREVIOUS VEHICLE S SYSTEM
SWITCH TO A USB CONNECTION RATHER THAN A PROPRIETARY SINGLE COMPANY CONNECTION I WILL DRIVE MY CAR FOR 10 YEARS AND I M STUCK WITH WHATEVER DONGLE WORKS WITH APPLE TODAY NO OTHER OPTIONS AND VW CAN T GUARANTEE APPLE WILL ALWAYS USE THAT SHAP

SWITCHING STATIONS WITH HAND CONTROLS 
SWITHING FROM OUT OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AFTER REACHING DESTINATION IS CONFUSING EITHER I M NOT DOING IT PROPERLY OR IT TAKES SEVERAL STEPS 
SYNC
SYNC DISPLAY ISSUE HAS BEEN MY ONLY COMPLAINT OF THE SYSTEM BEYOND HOW I EXPECTED IT TO FUNCTION
SYNC DISPLAYS SONG INFORMATION FROM ANDROID PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH FOR PANDORA AMAZON MP3 AND IHEART RADIO 
SYNC HAS GOTTEN BETTER THROUGH THE YEARS ESPECIALLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION I HAVE OWNED MULTIPLE F150 AND F250S AND THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST ADVANCED SIMPLE TO USE SYSTEM TO DATE
SYNC IPHONE VOICE NAVIGATION
SYNC IS AMAZING
SYNC IS COMPLICATED TO LEARN SHOULD BE EASIER

SYNC IS GREAT 
SYNC IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND HEAR CONSTANTLY NEVER HAS THE SAME ISSUE 
SYNC IS JUST NOT SUPER EASY TO USE/UNDERSTAND
SYNC IS NOT AN OVERLY INTUITIVE OPERATING SYSTEM COMMANDS ARE NOT EASILY UNDERSTOOD 
SYNC IS THE BEST THING WHEN DRIVING HOW RIGHT WHEN I GET INTO THE CAR IT CONNECTS TO MY PHONE AND I CAN CONTROL ALL THE BASIC FUNTICION LIKE SKIPPING SONG TO READING TXT ALL FROM MY STEERING WHEEL WITHOUT EVER TAKING MY EYES OFF THE ROAD
SYNC MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO START UP MUSIC WHEN I USE MY IPHONE TO PLAY SPOTIFY BECAUSE IT NEVEER UNDERSTANDS WHAT I SAW AND I THEREFORE HAVE TO SPEND TIME CLICKING THE BUTTONS WHEN I SHOULD BE DRIVING
SYNC SERVICE TOO BAD YOU NEED A PHONE TO CONNECT MY DROID PHONE DOES NOT SYNC VIA USB ONLY VIA BLUETOOTH 
SYNC SYSTEM CONTROLS COULD BE EASIER USE
SYNC SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE WORDS TOO SLOW AS WELL BY THE TIME YOU GET A RESPONSE YOU HAVE PAST THE TURNING POINT 
SYNC SYSTEM SEEMS TOO COMPLICATED TO USE RECEIVED LITTLE TO NO TRAINING IN SETTING UP OR USING THE SYSTEM AND THE PROVIDED DOCUMENTATION IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND

SYNC WITH MYFORD TOUCH DOESN T SUPPORT APP LINK IS NOT ABLE TO USE VOICE DICTATION TO RESPOND TO TEXT MESSAGES AND GETTING IT TO READ A TEXT MESSAGES IS NOT QUICK OR USER FRIENDLY WITHOUT TOUCHING THE SCREEN IF IT DETECTS A MESSAGE IT STORES IT 
SYNC WITH PHONE SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC IT IS RANDOM AND FRUSTRATING 
SYNCH VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETIMES FRUSTRATING WHEN SHE DOESN T RECOGNIZE WHAT I AM ASKING FOR ALSO QUALITY OF CALLS COMBINED WITH ROAD NOISE COULD PROBABLY BE A BIT BETTER 
SYNCHING OF DEVICES
SYNCING TO AN IPHONE TAKES A VERY LONG TIME WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE SONG TRACKS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL 
SYNCING TO STREAMING WEBSITES REMAINS A MYSTERY
SYNCRONIZATION OF PHONE S MEMORIZED PHONE NUMBER DATABASE WITH THE VOICE CONTROL SYSTEM I CAN T SEEM TO REQUEST A CALL OF A PERSON BY NAME 
SYRIUSXM
SYSTEM CAN BE A LITTLE SLUGGISH AT TIMES FASTER PROCESSOR AND IMPROVED TOUCH WOULD BE NICE NOT A DEAL BREAKER HOWEVER 
SYSTEM CONSISTENTLY FORGETS RADIO STATIONS AND RE SETS USB FLASH DRIVE TO SONG NUMBER 1 
SYSTEM CONTROLS ARE EASY TO USE AND THE QUALITY OF SOUND ADDS A LOT TO THE GOOD EXPERIENCE 
SYSTEM COULD BE MADE EASIER TO USE!
SYSTEM COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE
SYSTEM DISPLAY SEEMS A LITTLE DATED
SYSTEM DOE NOT ALERT WHEN I GET A TEXT MESSAGE WHEN MY PHONE IS CONNECTED TO THE IN CAR BLUETOOTH

SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE WORDS SIRIUSXM IS TERRIBLE TO DEAL WITH 
SYSTEM DOESN T ALLOW ALBUM NAVIGATION ON BLUETOOTH CONNECTED ANDROID PHONE THIS WORKED WELL ON MY PREVIOUS CAR A 2014 AUDI A7 
SYSTEM DOESN T RECOGNIZE VOICE COMMANDS LOUSY FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!
SYSTEM FUNCTIONS FINE HOWEVER THE CONTROLS ARE CONFUSING TO USE AND REQUIRE WAY TOO MUCH OF THE DRIVER S ATTENTION/TIME/LOOKING AWAY FROM THE ROAD TO OPERATE

SYSTEM GREAT
SYSTEM HAD ABILITY TO CONTROL SOUND PLACEMENT WITH A SCREEN COMMAND SYSTEM FOR FRONT TO BACK AND SIDE TO SIDE ETC GREAT BASS RESPONSIVENESS ALSO 
SYSTEM HAS GREAT FEATURES AND I LOVE WHAT WORKS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO TAKE THE BEST ROUTES COMPARED TO GOOGLE MAPS OR WAZE JAGUAR APPS DON T SEEM USEFUL AND DON T REALLY WORK MOST OF THE APPS ARE EXPENSIVE FROM WHAT I VE SEEN 
SYSTEM HAS SHUT DOWN
SYSTEM IN OUR 2011 F250 FORD IS MUCH BETTER WEATHER MAP AND ICON FOOR GAS AND FOOD LOCATION
SYSTEM IS A LITTLE GLITCHY HAVING SOME CONNECTIVITY ISSUES THAT I WILL HAVE LOOKED AT BY THE DEALER INTERNET CONNECTIVITY IS GLITCHY ALSO
SYSTEM IS A LITTLE OVERLY COMPLICATED COULD BE MADE EASIER TO USE/UNDERSTAND
SYSTEM IS BURDENSOME TOO MANY CHOICES OWNER S MANUAL IS MOSTLY ABOUT AUDIO SYSTEMS 
SYSTEM IS CLUMSY TO OPERATE NOT LOGICAL IN SEQUENCING FEATURES I LL ADMIT IT COULD PARTIALLY BE ME BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS STILL NEW TO ME 
SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL BUTTONS ARE SMALL HARD TO READ AND DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY CHANGE WHILE DRIVING NO WAY TO ELIMINATE UNUSED CHOICES AHA SYSTEM WON T WORK WITH IPHONE BUT WILL WITH ANDROID DOESN T HELP ME WITH MY IPHONE
SYSTEM IS DISTRACTING WHEN DRIVING
SYSTEM IS DOING WELL NO PROBLEMS SO FAR
SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY SLOW NOT ON PAR WITH CAR OR VEHICLE CLASS 
SYSTEM IS FAIRLY DIFFICULT TO GET USED TO NEED AN EASIER TO USE INTERFACE 
SYSTEM IS FAIRLY EASY TO USE BUT IT S BEST TO BE STOPPED WHEN USING IT CONTROLS REQUIRE HAND EYE COORDINATION THAT IS BEST NOT DISTRACTED FROM THE ROAD WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION VOICE CONTROL SYSTEM IS HANDY IN THESE CASES BUT IT DOES T 
SYSTEM IS FINE FOR MY PURPOSES
SYSTEM IS GREAT BUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS BELOW AVERAGE PREVIOUS IMPALA AND ACADIA HAVE BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION
SYSTEM IS HIT OR MISS SOMETIMES SOUNDS GREAT OTHERS SOUNDS MUDDIED NOT SURE HOW TO FIX MAYBE AN EQ FUNCTION? I USE THE CENTERPOINT SETTING AND THAT HELPS SOME 
SYSTEM IS MULTIFUNCTIONAL YET VERY RESPONSIVE AND FAST 
SYSTEM IS QUITE SLOW TO RESPOND AFTER USING TOUCH SCREEN ALSO NEED TO IMPROVE NUMBER OF RADIO STATIONS THAT CAN BE PROGRAMMED IT ONLY ALLOWS 6 STATIONS PER SETTING 
SYSTEM IS SLOW ESPECIALLY AT START UP 
SYSTEM IS SLOW TO CONNECT
SYSTEM IS SLOW TO UPDATE ESPECIALLY SATELLITE RADIO
SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLEX TAKES A COMPUTER NERD TO UNDERSTAND USAGE NOT ALL OF US WHO DRIVE CARS ARE COMPUTER WIZARDS 
SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLICATED AND NOT INTUITIVE 
SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLICATED TOUCH SCREENS ARE MUCH EASIER 
SYSTEM IS VERY DELAYED AS FAR AS RESPONSE IF YOU PUSH A BUTTON OR MOVE BETWEEN FM PRESETS SOMETIMES THE SYSTEM FREEZES THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE PHONE CALL IS JUST AVERAGE SOUNDS VERY TINNY

SYSTEM JUST SEEMS MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT NEEDS TO BE 
SYSTEM LACKS THE ABILITY TO SHOW POI S FOR DESTINATION MERCEDES HAS THIS FEATURE 
SYSTEM MISUNDERSTANDS NUMBERS
SYSTEM NEEDS A BUILT IN SUB INTERNAL NAVIGATION AND A HIGHER VOLUME LEVEL
SYSTEM NEW TO ME DEALER SET EVERYTHING UP I JUST NEED TO SIT IN THE CAR FOR A DAY AND STUDY THE BOOK AND FIGURE OUT THE SYSTEM DEALER ALSO SET UP BLUE TOOTH AND USED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES BUT WHEN I TRIED TO USE IT AGAIN IT SAID IT WASN T SET UP 
SYSTEM OPERATES DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL NAV SYSTEMS
SYSTEM PRE SETS COULD BE EASIER TO SET
SYSTEM RECOGNIZES MY VOICE

THE ABILITY TO USE PHONE FEATURES WHILE DRIVING OR FOR THE PASSENGER TO BE ABLE TO DO SO WHILE DRIVING IT IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING THAT THE VEHICLE HAS TO BE STOPPED OR IN PARK TO USE MANY OF THESE FEATURES NOT HELPFUL 
THE ABILITY TO USE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS 
THE ABILITY TO USE THE PHONE WHILE DRIVING
THE ABILITY TO USE THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO ADJUST THE RADIO SETTINGS AND VOLUMN
THE ABILITY TO USE USB DEVICES
THE ABILITY TO USE VOICE COMMANDS TO MAKE AND RECEIVE PHONE CALLS IS PRICELESS HANDS FREE ALLOWS FOR A MUCH SAFER DRIVE 
THE ABILITY TO VERBALLY CHANGE AUDIO SOURCE 
THE ABILITY TO VIEW 3D MAP DISPLAYS AND THE GRAPHICS IN THE ENTIRE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE ABILITY TO WATCH ENGINE PARAMETERS ON SCREEN VERSUS SEEING A RADIO OR NAV THE ENTIRE TIME 
THE ABILITY WHEN COMING UP TO A TURN THERE IS A LITTLE POP UP THAT SHOWS YOU WHAT ROAD YOUR ON N HOW MUCH FURTHER YOU HAVE TO GO
THE ABSENCE OF A TOUCH SCREEN AND THAT MOUSE TO CONTROL EVERYTHING IS AWFUL!!! IT S A 10 STEP PROCESS TO CHANGE A RADIO STATION! AND I DON T LIKE THE WAY ALL THE CHANNELS JUST FLOW TOGETHER AM FM SATELITE EVERYTHING IS TOGETHER JUST NOT DES 
THE ABSOLUTE WORST SOUND SYSTEM I HAVE BOUGHT IN MANY YEARS THE SYSTEM HAS NO ADJUSTMENT RANGE TO ADJUST FOR QUALITY SOUND I TOOK IT TO 2 AUDIO STORES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO I CAN SPEND AROUND 1200 ON A DECENT SYSTEM OR JUST GET RID OF 
THE ACCUMULATION OF STUFF ON THE REAR WINDOW IS BOTHERSOME
THE ACCURACY OF DRIVING DIRECTIONS
THE ACCURACY OF NAVIGATION COULD BE IMPROVED INCORRECT DIRECTIONS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED SEVERAL TIMES RESULTING IN TRAVEL DELAYS AND NEED TO USE MY IPHONE TO OBTAIN ACCURATE DIRECTIONS 
THE ACCURACY OF THE DESTINATIONS 
THE ACCURACY OF THE GPS
THE ACCURACY OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION I HAVE SOME FAMILY WITH SOME ODD NAMES AND IT ALWAYS PICKS UP ON IT 
THE ACCURACY OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS GREAT BUT THE LACK OF A TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT GREAT A TOUCH SCREEN SHOULD BE STANDARD 
THE ACTIVE DRIVER ASSIST SYSTEMS EYESIGHT SRVD EXCEED EXPECTATIONS! POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS 1 HID HEADLIGHTS AVAILABLE AT ALL TRIM LEVELS 2 OPTIONAL DIGITAL SPEEDOMETER VIA A SIMPLE HEAD UP DISPLAY HUD AVAILABLE AT ALL TRIM LEVELS 
THE ACTIVE LANE CHANGE AND OTHER FEATURES ARE TERRIFIC
THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD IF I HAD TO CHANGE ONE THING THE LOOK OF THE DISPLAY LOOKS SLIGHTLY DATED IT S NOTHING MAJOR BUT IF I M BEING NITPICKY THAT WOULD BE WHAT I WOULD CHANGE THE SOUND QUALITY IS ADEQUATE BUT CE 
THE ACTUAL NAVIGATION PART OF THE SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY PRIMITIVE AND DOES NOT FUNCTION AS I WOULD EXPECT IT TO 
THE ACTUAL SOUND QUALITY COULD BE IMOROVED 
THE ADAPTIVE HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE ON EVERY MODEL THEY ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY 
THE ADAPTIVE LED LIGHTS I HAVE DONT SEEM ANY BRIGHTER THAN THE XENONS NOT AS MUCH DIFFERENCE AS ID HOPED
THE ADDITION OF A HEAD UP DISPLAY WOULD PROVIDE ADDITION SAFETY 
THE ADDITION OF A PAUSE/PLAY BUTTON ON THE WHEEL
THE ADDITION OF GOOGLE S ANDROID AUTOMOBILE SYSTEM 
THE ADDITION OF LANE CHANGE SENSORS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL 
THE ADDITION OF THE FORWARD SIDE WINDOWS ON THE DOOR IS WELCOME FOR VISIBILITY 
THE ADDITION OF THE WINDOW AT THE A PILLAR AND MOVING THE MIRROR DOWN IS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT IN VISIBILITY 
THE ADDITON OF FOG LAMPS ON THE GS
THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT AND CATCH MY ATTENTION WITHOUT ME HAVING TO LOOK AT THE MIRROR FOR A SMALL WARNING I AM COMPARING THIS TO THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM ON MY 2013 JEEP OVERLAND 
THE ADVANCED PACKAGE EQUIPMENT PROVIDES A SAFE FEELING WHILE DRIVING 
THE AERODYNAMICS REGARDING APPEARANCE AND DRIVING PERFORMANCE 
THE AFOREMENTIONED CONNECTIVITY ISSUES OF BLUETOOTH 
THE AHA ONLINE SERVICES IS POTENTIALLY EXCEPTIONAL IT WILL NEED CONSIDERABLE IMPROVEMENT FROM AHA
THE AIM OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID SHOULD BE HIGHER IN THE MOUNTAINS IT TAKES A LONG PUMP TO GET ENOUGH LIQUID TO CLEAR THE WINDSHIELD IN TRAFFIC IT S FINE ON A CLEAR ROAD BUT WHEN LARGE TRUCKS ARE THROWING SNOW THE VOLUME IS ALMOST A H 
THE AIR PILLAR NO LONER HAVE THE SIS MIRROR ATTACHED IMPROVES VISIBILITY 
THE AIR RIDE SUS 
THE AIR SOUND TO OTHERS WHEN USING THE SPEAKER PHONE THE SLOWNESS OF THE RADIO SCION CHANGING WHEN IN HD MODE THE LACK OF TITLE ON SONGS PLAYED ON FM OR AM RADIO 
THE ALARM SOUNDS AS YOU PULL BACK TO YOUR OWN LANE FOLLOWING PASSING A CAR IT S ANNOYING 
THE ALERT ON THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS IS AN EXCELLENT FEATURE FOR ME
THE ALERT SYSTEM AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING MAKES ME A SAFER DRIVER 
THE ALERT SYSTEM IS SENSITIVE AND IF IT IS SNOWING IT GOES OFF EVEN IF THERE IS NOTHING THERE BECAUSE THE SENSOR IS COVERED AND THIS GETS DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING 
THE ALERT THE NAVIGATION GIVES AT POINT OF TURN
THE ALL AROUND CAMERAS ARE WONDERFUL!
THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM
THE ALPINE SYSTEM COULD BE BETTER ARRANGED AS FAR AS THE SURROUND SOUND IMMERSION THE HIGHS AND MIDS AREN T EXACTLY BLENDED WELL IN THE CABIN 
THE ALUMINUM SPEAKER FACES ARE VERY SLEEK MODERN AND ATTRACTIVE THE DUAL SUBWOOFERS IN THE FRONT VEHICLE FRAME ARE OUTSTANDING AND DELIVER DEEP POWERFUL BASS THAT RESONATES CRISPLY THROUGH THE CABIN THE BURMEISTER SYSTEM IS EXTRAORDINARY!
THE AM RADIO IS NOT VERY CLEAR 
THE AM/FM RADIO SPEAKERS
THE AMOUNBT OF INFORMATION THAT IS ON THE DISPLAY SCREEN SONG TITLE ARTIST NAME 
THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENT KEYSTROKES IT TAKES TO GO THROUGH MENUS AND CHOOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE MINIMIZED ALSO GOING BACK AND FORTH FROM TACTILE BUTTONS TO TOUCH SCREEN IS A BIT DISTRACTING 
THE AMOUNT OF PRESETS BOTH AM AND FM
THE AMOUNT OF SPACE BETWEEN THE LAST SIDE WINDOW AND THE WINDOW IN THE TAILGATE IS TOO GREAT IT MAKES THE BLIND SPOT FOR MOVING A LANE TO THE RIGHT TOO LARGE OUR OLD LEGACY STATION WAGON WAS BETTER IN THIS RESPECT 
THE AMPLIFIER SHOULD BE MORE POWERFUL 
THE ANGLE OF THE FRONT POST BETWEEN THE SIDE WINDOWS AND THE WINDSHIELD HAS BLOCKED MY VISION OF ONCOMING CROSS TRAFFIC SEVERAL TIMES 
THE ANGLE OF THE REAR WINDOW ALLOWS RAIN TO JUST SIT WITHOUT ROLLING OFF MAKING IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT WHILE DRIVING 
THE ANTI COLLISION FRONT SENSOR IS VERY SENSITIVE ALMOST TOO SENSITIVE 
THE ANTIQUATED FOOT OPERATED DIM SWITCH IS PREFERABLE TO ME THAN REMOVING MY HAND FROM THE WHEEL TO TOGGLE THE LIGHT SWITCH THE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR WOULD BE BETTER NOT BEING A WIDE ANGLE MIRROR IF YOU NEED TO JUDGE DISTANCE WHEN BACKING 
THE APP FOR IPHONE IS VERY OUTDATED AND IS NOT ENJOYABLE TO USE FOR AS MUCH TECHNOLOGY AS EXISTS ON THIS CAR THE IOS APP BRINGS THAT EXPERIENCE DOWN 
THE APP THAT CONNECTS YOU TO THE INTERNET CONTINUALLY ASKS YOU TO SIGN UP FOR EVERY TIME WE USE ALSO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS GREAT THE ONLY THING IS ON LONG TRIPS IF YOU STOP FOR A BATHROOM BREAK IT REPEATEDLY TELLS YOU YOU ARE GOING THE WR 
THE APP WILL NOT CONNECT OTHERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM
THE APPEAL I GET MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THE CAR 
THE APPEARANCE IS NICE IT IS NOT THE BIG NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT EVEN SO THE SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND HAS PLENTY OF FEATURES 
THE APPEARANCE OF THE CAR
THE APPEARANCE OF THE CUE INTERFACE 
THE APPEARANCE OF THE FACE HAS A LOT TO BE DESIRED 
THE APPEARANCE VERY CLASSY LOOKING
THE APPERANCE
THE APPS ARE A LITTLE CONFUSING AND I CAN T SEEM TO SYNCH THEM WITH MY PHONE 
THE APPS ARE CLUNKY AND LACKING IN FUNCTIONALITY THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS EASY TO USE LIMIT THE USE OF CERTAIN FEATURES WHEN DRIVING AND SOMETIMES AT ODD PLACES AND YOU CAN NOT PICK/CHOOSE WHICH APPS YOU WANT AND DON T WANT LIKEWISE THERE IS NO 
THE APPS ARE HARD TO USE THE SONG SELECTION AND NAVIGATION INTERFACE IS HORRIBLE AND SLOW 
THE APPS AVAILABLE FOR SMART PHONE OPERATIONS ARE WEAK AT BEST NOT TO MANY OPTIONS NOT IMPRESSIVE AT ALL
THE APPS DO NOT SUPPORT BLACKBERRY PHONES AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE 
THE APPS DO NOT WORK 
THE APPS DON T HAVE THE BEST REAL NEED OR USE THE APP I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IS BEING ABLE TO PUT GOOGLE MAPS ON THE SCREEN SO I GET THE LATEST MAP DATA AND NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR AN UPGRADE
THE APPS DONT WORK VERY WELL THE ONLY 1 THAT DOES IS PANDORA
THE APPS FUNCTIONALITY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT 
THE APPS I DON T LIKE AHA FOR EXAMPLE IF I COULD ADD MY OWN APPS THEN THAT WOULD BE COOL ALSO IT TAKES TOO LONG TO LINK MY PHONE TO THE SYSTEM THE CONNECTIVE TIME IS LONG NOT THE PHYSICAL CONNECTION STARLINK IS KINDA USELESS IF YOU HAVE PANDOR 
THE APPS LIKE FACEBOOK ARE VERY BASIC AND RATHER POINTLESS TO USE IT TAKES TOO LONG FOR THE NEWSFEED TO LOAD PAGE BY PAGE AND THERE ARE NO PICTURES IT S ALSO HARD TO NAVIGATE QUICKLY BLUETOOTH IS GOOD AS LONG AS I MANUALLY CALL BECAUSE MY COMM 
THE APPS SUCH AS AHA AND PANDORA ARE HARD TO USE I HAVE TO USE BLUETOOTH FOR ANY AUDIO FROM PHONE TO SUBARU I WOULD LIKE TO PLUG IN MY PHONE AND PLAY!
THE APPS TAKE TOO LONG TO LOAD OFTENTIMES I CAN PULL MY IPHONE OUT OF MY POCKET AND PULL UP THE WEATHER AND PUT IT BACK IN MY POCKET WHILE THE ONBOARD APP IS STILL DISPLAYING THE CONNECTING MESSAGE ADDITIONALLY THE MUSIC REGISTER WHILE A 
THE AREA BEHIND THE REAR SEAT IS TO HIGH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE BACK WHEN BACKING UP 
THE AREA BETWEEN THE DRIVES SIDE DOOR AND THE REAR DOOR IS QUIT THICK AND IMPAIRS VISION THE REAR WINDOW COULD BE WIDER IS HARDER TO SEE OUT THE CORNERS OF THE REAR WINDOW IF SOMEONE IS SITTING IN THE 3RD SEAT 
THE AREA BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOORS IS LARGE AND RIGHT IN A LOCATION THAT MAKES LOOKING FOR CARS EITHER FROM SIDE STREETS OR PASSING DIFFICULT TO SEE EVEN WHEN TURNING OUR HEAD IT MAKES YOU RELY ON THE SIDE MIRRORS MORE AND I PERSONALLY WA 
THE AROUND VIEW CAMERA SYSTEM
THE AROUND VIEW MONITOR SYSTEM IS THE BEST FEATURE IN INFINITI QX50 
THE ASPECT I LIKE MOST IS THE FACT THAT IT IS THERE IF AND WHEN I NEED IT 
THE ATS COUPE HAS A SEVERE RIGHT REAR BLIND SPOT WHEN OBSERVING IF THERE IS ANOTHER VEHICLE IN THE RIGHT LANE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS A MUST ON THIS VEHICLE UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT HAVE IT ON THIS VEHICLE SO EXTRA CARE MUST BE TAKEN WHEN CHA 
THE AUDI BANG AND OLUFSEN SYSTEM IS DISAPPOINTING LACK OF BASS EXTENSION AND DEFINITION MID RANGE PRESENCE IS THIN AND UNDEFINED ACCURATE TO A POINT BUT LIFELESS I AM A TRUE AUDIOPHILE AND THIS IS NOT AN AUDIOPHILE LEVEL SYSTEM BMW HARMO 
THE AUDI CONNECT GOOGLE EARTH FEATURE IS A VERY NICE AND HELPFUL FEATURE 
THE AUDI Q3 MAY NOT HAVE THE LATEST MMI SYSTEM OF THE A3 BUT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST LOOKING INTERFACES IN TERMS OF THE SOFTWARE NAVIGATION AND UI AND ONE OF THE EASIEST TO USE THAT I VE COME ACROSS THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTS SEAMLESSLY FROM MY ANDROI 
THE AUDI Q3 NEEDS A USB PORT IT HAS TWO SD CARD PORTS I AM NOT SURE WHO USES SD CARDS ANYMORE 
THE AUDI Q5 IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! PERFECT SIZE EXCELLENT QUALITY AND GREAT FOR SMALL FAMILIES!
THE AUDIO AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM HAVE PERFECT SOUND THE SOUND IS LOUD AND CRYSTAL CLEAR VERY AMAZING SOUND AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM 
THE AUDIO AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ARE EXCELLENT THE NAV SYSTEM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT THE DISPLAY DOES NOT REFLECT YOUR ROUTE IN MANY MODES I WOULD LIKE TO SEE GOOGLE MAPS INTEGRATED ON THE DISPLAY 
THE AUDIO AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS EASILY SWITCH BACK AND FORTH FROM MUSIC NAVIGATION AND PHONE CALLS ALL FROM MY PHONE THROUGH BLUETOOTH WITHOUT SKIPPING THE SONG PLAYING 
THE AUDIO AND ENTERTAINMENT IS FINE BUT WOULD HAVE LIKED AN OPTION FOR REARSEATS WITH BUILT IN VIDEO FOR THE KIDS 
THE AUDIO AND ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY THE SOUND SYSTEM IS TRULY OUTSTANDING 
THE AUDIO AND NAV SYSTEMS ARE SLEEK AND MODERN AND THE BEST ASPECT IS REALLY ALL OF THE FEATURES THAT IT OFFERS LIKE THINGS I DIDN T KNOW I NEEDED BEFORE BUT REALLY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I CAN PUSH A BUTTON AND HAVE IT THE NAVIGATION TAKE ME TO THE 
THE AUDIO AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOOKS REALLY GOOD BUT IT S NOT EASY TO USE MAYBE BECAUSE MY AGE 79 YEARS OLD 
THE AUDIO AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS ARE THE BEST TOOLS FOR THIS CAR
THE AUDIO AT BLUETOOTH CONNECT IS LOW AND MUFFLED 
THE AUDIO COMMANDS ARE NOT ALWAYS AS RESPONSIVE AS THEY SHOULD BE 
THE AUDIO COMMANDS CAN BE TEDIOUS TO USE SEVERAL TIMES IT HAS MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT I VE SAID AND I VE HAD TO START OVER WHICH IS REALLY FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES IT S EASIER TO USE THE TOUCHSCREEN TO REACH MY COMMAND 
THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION AND ENTERTAINMENT IS GOOD BUT I HAVE NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM I ALSO THINK THAT ALL THE NEW VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION AND ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS ARE VERY INTUITIVE THE BUTTONS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN ARE LARGE AND EASY TO OPERATE SWITCHING BETWEEN SOURCES IS VERY EASY
THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM ARE VERY EASY TO USE AND THE QUALITY OF SOUND IS EXCELLENT VERY PLEASED
THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION NOT PICKING UP THE VOICE COMMANDS WELL EVEN THOUGH THE CAR COMES WITH A PERSONIFICATION TEACHER � IS REALLY A BUMMER NOT BEING ABLE TO STORE CONTACTS BY FIRST NAME INSTEAD OF LAST NAME FIRST IS ALSO VERY ANNOYING WHEN TR
THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS GREAT IN THE MIT OUTLANDER MY ONLY QUALM WITH IT IS THAT WHEN I MAKE HANDS FREE CALLS THE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CALL GENERALLY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME HEARING ME 
THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION VOICE RECOGNITION ALL WORK GREAT WE JUST HAVEN T TAKEN ANY TRIPS WITH OUR NEW JEEP YET TO EXPERIENCE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
THE AUDIO CONTROL DOES NOT RECOGNIZE MY ACCENT 
THE AUDIO CONTROLS AND DISPLAY ARE ALL FANTASTIC AND VERY EASY TO USE! EVEN MY 60 YEAR OLD FATHER CAN USE IT!
THE AUDIO CONTROLS ARE IN A SHADED AREA MAKING THE VOLUME CONTROL HARDER TO SEE 
THE AUDIO CONTROLS BOTH ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE TOUCH SCREEN NEED TO BE ADDRESSED 
THE AUDIO CONTROLS COULD BE PROGRAMMED FROM THE STEERING WHEEL TO BE ON EITHER SIDE I DON T LIKE THEM ON THE RIGHT SIDE BUT I M SURE OTHERS DO!
THE AUDIO CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL DON T HAVE TO TAKE HANDS OFF STEERING WHEEL TO CHANGE RADIO STATION OR ADJUST SOUND WHILE DRIVING
THE AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE NOT INTUITIVE AND PUTTING DIALS/ROLLERS ON THE WHEEL SEEMS DATED AND OLD TECHNOLOGY ALSO THE RADIO HAS NO FAVORITE BUTTONS AND NO EASY WAY TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN FAVORITES UNLESS THE FAVORITES ARE DISPLA 
THE AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE RIGHT SIDE 
THE AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN ARE VERY SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO ADJUST WHEN DRIVING I AM CONCERNED THEY COULD LEAD TO ACCIDENTS FOR EXAMPLE TO ADJUST THE SOUND LEVEL YOU HAVE TO TOUCH A SMALL BUTTON ALONG SIDE OF SEVERAL OTHERS TO ADJ 
THE AUDIO COULD HAVE MORE BASS 
THE AUDIO DISPLAY AND LINKING IS A LITTLE DATED FOR WHAT IS AVAILABLE IT S GREAT BUT THERE IS BETTER AVAILABLE IN LIKE LEVELED AUTOMOBILES 
THE AUDIO HAS BEEN VERY GOOD FOR THE NUMBER OF TIMES I HAVE DRIVEN MY CAR 
THE AUDIO HAS NOT CHANGED TOO MUCH FROM 13 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SPEAKER LAY OUT AND SOUND QUALITY THE QUALITY IS MUCH HIGHER WITH THE 15 WRX AND CLEANER THEN THE 13 THE DECK IS THE SAME AND THE CONTROLS ARE THE SAME 
THE AUDIO INTERFACE IS VERY DATED NAVIGATION DATA ALSO SEEMS DATED I VE LIVED ON MY STREET FOR 3 YEARS AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM STILL DOES NOT HAVE THE CORRECT SPELLING OF THE STREET NOR DOES IT CONTAIN THE CORRECT HOUSE NUMBERS ON THE STREET 
THE AUDIO IS ACCEPTABLE BUT THE ACTUAL SOUND OF THE BASIC SYSTEM ISN T THAT GREAT I WOULD EXPECT BETTER SOUND FOR MUSIC 
THE AUDIO IS BAD WHEN USING HANDSFREE THE OTHER PARTY HAS INDICATED THAT NOISE LEVEL IS TERRIBLE 
THE AUDIO IS CRISP YET NOT DISTRACTING THE HANDS FREE PHONE BLUETOOTH IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND LOUD 
THE AUDIO IS CRYSTAL CLEAR AND NO DISTORTION EXISTS AT MODERATE LEVELS COMMUNICATION IS CLEAR WHEN USING HANDS FREE FEATURE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS ARE USER FRIENDLY AND PROVIDE 
THE AUDIO IS GREAT VERY CLEAN SOUND
THE AUDIO IS REALLY GOOD AND I CAN FEEL THE BASS AND SOUNDS 
THE AUDIO ISN T OF GOOD QUALITY MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE WHICH WAS A 2003 HAD A MUCH BETTER AUDIO SYSTEM 
THE AUDIO ISN T REALLY LOUD AS HOW I EXPECTED IT TO BE 
THE AUDIO LACKS SOMETHING ON THE LOW END IT NEEDS MORE BASS 
THE AUDIO MENUS ARE HARD TO FIND AND DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE WHEN 2 PAIRED PHONES ARE IN RANGE THE CAR SHOULD ASK WHICH ONE TO USE SINCE THE CAR HAS A LIMITED RANGE I RARELY NEED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT S IMPORTANT TO HAVE BUT MORE ATTENTI 
THE AUDIO NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO OPERATE
THE AUDIO NEEDS SOME OOMPH! THE DAYS OF THE MONSOON STEREO SYSTEMS WERE GREAT ESPECIALLY IF THERE WAS A SMALL STOCK 8 SUBWOOFER SOMEWHERE IN THERE THE TRUNK IN THIS CAR IS HUGE I M SURPRISED THERE ISN T AN AMPLIFIER AND SMALL SUB THROWN IN T 
THE AUDIO ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY DETAILED AND USEFUL FOR EXAMPLE IF APPROACHING A TURN IT DOESN T JUST TELL YOU TO TURN IN 250 FEET BUT IT TELLS YOU THAT IT S THE SECOND LEFT 
THE AUDIO ON THE PHONE ISN T ALWAYS VERY CLEAR & DISTINCTIVE 
THE AUDIO ON THE RADIO IS INCONSISTENT HAVE TO ADJUST THE VOLUME TOO OFTEN 
THE AUDIO OUTPUT IS AWESOME! NOT THAT IT HAS TO BE VERY LOUD FOR QUALITY SOUND I THINK IT HAS A NICE RICH SOUND 
THE AUDIO QUALITY COULD BE ENHANCED ADD ABILITY TO CONTROL AUDIO EQUALIZATION CONTROLS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE THE MOST USEFUL SAFE OVER DASHBOARD CONTROLS/VOICE COMMANDS 
THE AUDIO QUALITY IS EXCELLENT ASIDE FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED BLUETOOTH ISSUE I AM SO GLAD I ENDED UP WITH THE PREMIUM SOUND PACKAGE 
THE AUDIO QUALITY IS EXCEPTIONAL WITH THE PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM 
THE AUDIO QUALITY IS GREAT BOSE SYSTEM IS AWESOME 
THE AUDIO QUALITY IS THE BEST OF ANY VEHICLE I HAVE EVER HEARD 
THE AUDIO QUALITY ISN T VERY GOOD IT DOESN T SOUND AS PARTICULARLY GOOD AS ANY OTHER CAR AND DOESN T HAVE SURROUND SOUND 
THE AUDIO QUALITY OF THE HANDS FREE PHONE SYSTEM EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME AND I CAN HEAR CALLERS VERY WELL TOO THE SOUND IS NEVER DISTORTED 
THE AUDIO QUALITY WHEN USING BLUETOOTH IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR AND THE LISTENER OCCASIONALLY SAYS THEY CAN T HEAR ME 
THE AUDIO SCREEN SEEMS LOW TECH
THE AUDIO SELECTIONS ARE NOT INTUITIVE 
THE AUDIO SHOULD HAVE OTHER EQ OPTIONS INSTEAD OF JUST BASS TREBLE ADJUSTMENTS ALSO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE AUDIO MORE EASILY WITH THE STEERING WHEEL
THE AUDIO SOUND IS CLEAR THE SIZE OF THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS GREAT AND THE VOICE IS CLEAR 
THE AUDIO SOUND IS EXCELLENT NAVIGATION SCREEN SIZE IS EXCELLENT GIVES YOU DIFFERENT VIEWS AND ALSODISPLAYS TRAFFIC GIVE RIUTE GUIDANCE IN THE INSTRUMENT CLUSTER 
THE AUDIO SOUND IS GREAT I M NOT INTO USING THE NAVIGATION CELL PHONE OR INTERNET BUT I AM SURE MY WIFE WILL LOVE IT WHEN WE ARE TRAVELING HAVE NOT HAD ANY LENGTHY TRIPS IN MY NEW TRUCK YET 
THE AUDIO SOUND IS NICE QUALITY THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS INTUITIVE THE ONLY THING TO IMPROVE UPON IS THE SOURCE/STATION SELECTION BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL THE WAY THE BUTTON SITS I OFTEN CHANGE RADIO SOURCES WHEN I AM TRYING TO CHANGE 
THE AUDIO SOUND IS TERRIFIC!
THE AUDIO SOUND OF MY BLUETOOTH CONNECTED PHONE IS CLEARER THEN THE SATELLITE RADIO BY FAR
THE AUDIO SOUNDS CHEAP NEED BETTER SPEAKERS OR MORE WATTAGE FROM STEREO
THE AUDIO SOUNDS VERY GOOD IN THE CAR AND THE NAVIGATION SEEMS UP TO DATE WHEN WE USE IT 
THE AUDIO SPEAKER SYSTEM IS WELL SETUP FOR MY HEARING AT MODERATE TO LOW VOLUME 
THE AUDIO SPEAKER SYSTEM!! GOOD LORD I M THINKING OF GETTING AN ACOUSTICIAN TO TUNE MY CAR SPEAKER SYSTEM BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THE EQ IN THE CAR IS JUST WACKY ON SOME SONGS I M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE INTRO GUITAR WILL BE SO QUIET I CANT HEAR IT 
THE AUDIO SPEAKERS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH RANGE AND LACK RICHNESS 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE A LITTLE EASIER TO NAVIGATE THROUGH 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD HAVE BEEN DESIGN TO BETTER USAGE OF SPACE CD PLAYER IS PLACED AT AN HARD TO REACH POSITION 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM HAS PHENOMENAL SOUND QUALITY FOR BEING STOCK 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IN MY 2007 NISSAN ALTIMA WAS WORLDS BETTER THAN THAT OF THE CAMARO WHICH NEEDLESS TO SAY IS DISAPPOINTING THE CARS ONLY SAVING GRACE IS THE EXHAUST NOTE MAKES UP FOR IT THAT AND THE FACT THAT AUDIO SYSTEMS CAN ALWAYS BE UPGRAD 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IN THE PLATINUM SERIES IS NOT VERY GOOD THE SPEAKERS ARE SO CHEAP THAT IF YOU TURN THE VOLUME UP THE RADIO CUTS OFF THE BASS AND TREBBLE SO THE CHEAP SPEAKERS DONT BREAK AND THIS MAKES THE RADIO SOUND WORSE ALL MORE CONTROLS 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS CHEAP ONLY 4 SPEAKERS THAT SOUNDS REALLY BAD 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE I ALSO LIKE BEING ABLE TO EASILY TAKE CELL PHONE CALLS VIA THE AUDIO SYSTEM 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FANTASIC 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FINE AND I REALLY LIKE THE WIFI HOTSPOT FEATURE HOWEVER I USE MY SMART PHONE WITH A BLUETOOTH HEADSET FOR CALLS AND I ALSO USE MY SMARTPHONE S MAP/NAVIGATION SYSTEM PRIMARILY BECAUSE I M USED TO IT 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FINE BUT NOTHING SPECIAL I LIKE THE BLUETOOTH AND DISPLAY FOR IT 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FINE BUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS 10 YEARS BEHIND 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS GOOD BUT LOOKS OUTDATED 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS GOOD MY PHONE/IPHONE HAS OCCASSIONALLY NOT CONNECTED 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS GREAT I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS YET 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS GREAT NOT TOO FANCY BUT STILL APPEALING ON THE DOWNSIDE SIRRUS SATELLITE RADIO HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY HOUNDING ME TO SIGN UP FOR A CONTRACT THIS IS VERY ANNOYING I HAVE TOLD THEM NO MANY TIMES BUT THEY KEEP CALLING AND CALL 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS GREAT THE MUSIC SOUNDS WONDERFUL AND THE CAR IS SO QUIET THE VOLUME DOES NOT NEED TO BE TURNED UP VERY LOUD THE HANDS FREE CALLING IS ANOTHER FANTASTIC FEATURE THAT MAKES IT EASY TO TAKE CALLS AND NOT BE DISTRACTED BY YOUR PH 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS HAS VERY POOR SOUND REAR AND FRONT DOOR SPEAKERS SOUND HORRIBLE OVERALL THE SYSTEM IS NOT LIKED FOR SUCH AN EXPENSIVE CAR 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS ON POINT
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING I DO NOT KNOW WHY ANYONE WOULD WANT TO BY AFTER MARKET EQUIPMENT TO REPLACE WHAT GM HAS INSTALLED!
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS PRETTY POOR I WILL NEED TO UPGRADE IT 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS QUITE GOOD BUT IT ISN T GREAT MAYBE I EXPECT TOO MUCH?
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS REALLY EASY TO USE AND OTHER THEN BLUE TOOTH BEING NOT QUITE AS LOUD AS I D LIKE I M 54 AND A BIT HARD OF HEARING IT S STILL AWESOME 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS TERRIFIC IN MANY RESPECTS MUSIC OF DIFFERENT GENRES SOUND CRISP CLEAR WITH RICH FULL SOUND ANY SOUND THAT HAS EVEN MODERATE BASS HOWEVER MAKES THE REAR SPEAKERS SOUND DISTORTED ALMOST LIKE THE SPEAKERS HAVE BLOWN I 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS USER FRIENDLY I LIKE THE NAV SYSTEMS ABILITY TO ADVISE OF ROAD PROBLEMS AND CONSTRUCTION AREAS AHEAD 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY BASIC IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WAS TOUCH SCREEN AS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD IN A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE VEHICLES IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE IF NAVIGATION AND ENTERTAINMENT WERE A BIT MORE STANDARD IN AUDI OVERALL 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE WHEN COMMUNICATING WITH PEOPLE 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY CLEAR SOUND AND IS EASY TO CHANGE STATIONS PRESSING THE BUTTON TO TURN ON THE RADIO IS NOT SO EASY YOU MUST TOUCH THE BUTTON AT THE EXACT SPOT OR IT WILL NOT TURN ON I HAVE TO TOUCH THE BUTTON SEVERAL TIMES TO START RADIO
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY EASY TO USE AND CONTROL WHILE DRIVING 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY NICE THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND FOR THE FREE TRIAL VERSION OF SIRIUS XM RADIO WAS ONLY SO SO I WASN T THAT IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS WAY BELOW AVERAGE
THE AUDIO SYSTEM SEEMS CHEAP LOW QUALITY IT WORKS BUT NOT GREAT 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISPLAY NON ENGLISH CHARACTERS
THE AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE A DEFAULT VOLUME SETTING FOR EVERY RESTART 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE AN OPTION OF USING A USB DRIVE/MEMORY CARD 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM SOUND QUALITY AND ON SCREEN USE EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM STARTS PLAYING MY IPHONE FROM WHEREVER IT WAS WHEN I WAS LAST IN THE CAR OR THE LAST TIME I USED MY IPHONE S ITUNES IT S FANTASTIC TO HAVE THE SEAMLESS PICKUP AND THE AUTOMATIC BLUETOOTH PAIRING WHICH IS RIDICULOUSLY FAST TOO 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A LOUDER VOLUME OR MORE POWER FROM THE DECK TO THE SPEAKERS ALSO 2 MORE SPEAKERS ADDED TO THE REAR BEHIND THE SEATS TO MAKE 6 TOTAL SPEAKERS THE ONLY EXISTING SPEAKERS ARE IN THE DOORS OF THE CAR 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM WAS REALLY IMPRESSIVE ONCE YOU GET PASS THE OBSTACLE OF LINKING YOUR DEVICE TO THE CAR YOU ARE SET TO ENJOY FLAWLESS AUDIO AND TRANSITIONS FROM ALL THE CAR S MUSIC SOURCES 
THE AUDIO SYSTEM WHILE GOOD FOR A SUBARU IS NOT UP TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS
THE AUDIO SYSTEM WITH VOICE ACTIVATION IS A REAL TREAT AND EASY TO USE
THE AUDIO SYSTEM WORKS WELL BUT I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN THE STEREO SOUND SYSTEM IT JUST SEEMS TO BE LACKING SOMETHING 
THE AUDIO SYSYEM AND SPEAKER SOUND QUALITY IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED
THE AUDIO UI 
THE AUDIO VOICE COMMANDS NEEDS A SIMPLE VOCABULARY UNDER STAND WHAT CANCEL MEANS 
THE AUDIO VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM SAVES TIME AND IS EFFICIENT ALSO THE SOUND SYSTEM IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE AUDIO VOLUME ALWAYS COMES ON WHEN THE VEHICLE IS FIRST TURNED ON USUALLY AT AN ALMOST INAUDIBLE VOLUME I CAN SEE NO LOGIC TO THIS AND IT S A DAILY IRRITATION 
THE AUDIO VOLUME FOR THE RADIO IS NOT THE SAME AS THE AUDIO VOLUME FOR THE MP3 FOR THE MP3 THE AUDIO VOLUME HAS TO BE TURNED ALL THE WAY UP FOR MUSIC WITH A WIDE DYNAMIC RANGE SUCH AS CLASSICAL MUSIC IF LISTENING TO ROCK WHICH IS RECORDED LOUD 
THE AUDIO VOLUME INCREASE/DECREASE SYSTEM IS A LITTLE SLOW TO START WHEN I ACCELERATE THE VOLUME DOESN A ALWAYS INCREASE AND DECREASE PROPERLY 
THE AUDIO VOLUME IS TOO SOFT THE TUNE BUTTON SHOULD BE A KNOB FOR QUICK TUNING THE POI IS DIFFICULT TO USE 
THE AUDIO WHEN USING HANDS FREE PHONE IS SOMETIMES MUFFLED AND THERE S A LOT OF EXTERNAL NOISES SO I CAN T HEAR THE OTHER PERSON ON THE PHONE SOMETIMES
THE AUDIO/ENTERTAINMENT/NAVIGATION/COMPUTER SYSTEM SHOULD BE JUST LIKE ANOTHER SMART PHONE I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE MY PHONE PLAN S DATA PLAN BE ABLE TO INSTALL APPS AND MAKE CALLS THE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE A PROPRIETARY CHEVROLET OPERA 
THE AUDIO/PHONE PANEL GETS TOO LIGHT WHEN CAR LIGHTS ARE ON HARD TO SEE IN SUNSHINE
THE AUTO AIMING HEAD LIGHTS ARE AMAZING
THE AUTO BRIGHT ON THE HEADLIGHTS IS WAY TOO SENSITIVE IT WILL DIM THE LIGHTS WHEN IT SEE BRIGHT SNOW AT TIMES IT IS BASICALLY INEFFECTIVE IN ADDITION WHEN IT DOES DIM IT SHOULD TURN THE FOG LIGHTS BACK ON 
THE AUTO CONNECT TO MY MUSIC ON IPHONE 
THE AUTO DIMMING REARVIEW MIRROR IS FANTASTIC!
THE AUTO FILLS REALLY SOLID
THE AUTO MAGIC HIGH BEAMS ARE A JOKE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISMANTLE THAT FEATURE IT IS VERY DANGEROUS THAT THEY TURN ON WHEN THEY THINK YOU NEED THEM RATHER THAN WHEN YOU KNOW YOU NEED THEM MUST FIX THAT
THE AUTO RUNNING LIGHTS ARE TOO DIM FOR TWILIGHT AND FOGGY MORNING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I OVER RIDE THE AUTO RUNNING LIGHTS SYSTEM AND ACTIVELY TURN ON MY HEADLIGHTS TO MAKE SURE THAT MY GREY CAR CAN BE SEEN 
THE AUTO SENSOR MAKES UP FOR THE REAR VISIBILITY ISSUE 
THE AUTO WIPERS DO NOT HAVE A FUNCTION THAT WORKS WHEN IT IS NEARLY MISTING 
THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MOST OF WHAT I SAY I MUST REPEAT MY WORDS OVER AND OVER 
THE AUTOMATED VOICE SOMETIMES DOES NOT RECOGNIZE WHAT I AM ASKING IT TO DO
THE AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT OF AUDIO VOLUME TO COMPENSATE FOR NOISE LEVEL IS POOR 
THE AUTOMATIC DIMMING FEATURE OF THE MAIN DISPLAY SCREEN SOMETIMES FAILS TO DIM TO THE LEVEL I VE SET 
THE AUTOMATIC FRONT WIPERS ARE NOT VERY SENSITIVE
THE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHT FUNCTION DOES NOT FUNCTION BELOW 35 MPH THIS IS TRULY ANNOYING SINCE THAT IS WHEN I WANT IT TO WORK THIS CAUSES EXTRA STEPS IN TURNING HIGH BEAMS ON AND OFF SUN VISORS COULD USE AND EXTENSION TO MAKE THEM MORE EFFECTIVE 
THE AUTOMATIC HI BEAMS NEED TO BE ADJUSTED TO BETTER SENSE SURROUNDING LIGHT OR LACK THEREOF 
THE AUTOMATIC PARING WITH MY IPHONE WHEN I START THE CAR 
THE AUTOMATIC PROJECTOR HEADLAMPS ALONG WITH RAIN SENSING WIPERS ALLOWS ME TO DRIVE SAFER PERIOD I CAN PAY ATTENTION TO THE ROAD RATHER THAN WORRY ABOUT ADJUSTING WIPER BLADE SPEED 
THE AUTOMATIC RAIN WIPERS DON T ALWAYS DETECT RAIN 
THE AUTOMATIC SWITCH TO THR AUXILIARY INPUT IS ANNOYING WHEN THE CHORD IS BUMPED AS IT LOSES CONTACT AND SWITCHES BACK AND FORTH 
THE AUTOMATIC WINDSHEILD WIPERS DO NOT ALWAYS WORK PROPERLY THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY COME ON WHEN THERE IS RAIN ALL OVER THE WINDSHIELD AS WELL AS THERE BEING LITTLE RAIN ON THE WINDSHEILD AND THE 
THE AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPER TECHNOLOGY COULD BE IMPROVED THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE WIPERS ACTIVATE WHEN THERE IS NO PRECIPITATION AND OTHER TIMES WHEN THERE IS PRECIPITATION ON THE WINDSHIELD AND THEY DON T ACTIVATE ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE A M 
THE AUTOMATIC WIPER RAIN SENSOR DOES NOT WORK WELL 
THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS MODE IS NOT SENSITIVE ENOUGH EVEN WITH MAXIMUM SENSITIVITY SETTING IN MANY SITUATIONS IT LEAVES THE WINDSHIELD WITH WATER ON IT ESPECIALLY WHEN VEHICLE IS STATIONARY 
THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS WHICH ACTIVATE WHEN THE WINDSHIELD GETS WET ARE A NICE TOUCH THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT CAR IS SOLID AND HAS A LEGACY OF SAFETY 
THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS WORK WELL IN RAIN AND SNOW 
THE AUX JACK DOESN T WORK PROPERLY 
THE AUX OUTLET COULD WORK!
THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE IS WHAT I LIKE MAY NOT USE OFTEN BUT IT IS THERE AS I NEED IT 
THE AVAILABILITY TO UPGRADE TO THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM WITHOUT HAVING TO UPGRADE TO A SAHARA HAVE THE OPTION AVAILABLE FOR THE WRANGLER
THE AVAILABLE APPS ARE VERY RUDIMENTARY CONSIDERING THE CAPABILITIES OF TODAY S SMARTPHONES I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE ALL THE CONTENTS OF MY PHONE AND NOT JUST A COUPLE OF ELEMENTS I E PHONE AND MUSIC 
THE AVALON IS CONSIDERED THE TOP OF THE LINE FOR THE TOYOTA BRAND AND TOP LINE NEW CARS ALWAYS COME EQUIPPED WITH DRLS DRLS ARE A MUST FOR SAFETY BUT OF THE 4 DIFFERENT TOYOTA HYBRID TRIM MODELS ONLY THE TOP MODEL COMES EQUIPPED WITH DRLS SI 
THE AWD ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE FANTASTIC IN THE SNOW!
THE AWD IS INCREDIBLE!
THE AWD REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL CONNECTED TO THE ROAD
THE AWD SYSTEM IS TOP NOTCH
THE B AND C PILLARS ARE VERY WIDE 
THE B COLUMNS ARE PRETTY WIDE 
THE B PILLAR IS A LITTLE ON THE THICK SIDE SO IT S A GREAT THING THAT BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS AVAILABLE I THINK IT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC WITHOUT THAT FEATURE
THE B PILLAR IS TOO THICK ON THE VEHICLE IT CREATES AN ABNORMALLY LARGE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S REAR CORNER THAT COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS 
THE B PILLAR IS TOO WIDE AND MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO QUICKLY GLANCE AND SEE IF THERE IS TRAFFIC TO THE SIDE OF MY VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING 
THE B PILLAR SEEMS LIKE IT S DIRECTLY IN MY LINE OF SIGHT WHEN CHANGING LANES /
THE B PILLARS ON THE CAR ARE A LITTLE WIDER THAN NORMAL 
THE B&O SOUND SYSTEM IS AMAZING HOWEVER THE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION WITH IPHONES CAN BE IMPROVED 
THE B&O SOUND SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL! CAN BE ADJUSTED TO SUIT MANY DIVERSE MUSIC GENRES 
THE B&O SOUNDS SYSTEM SOUNDS FANTASTIC WAS ONE OF THE REASONS FOR ME TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE
THE B&O SYSTEM IS AWESOME!
THE BACK DOOR WINDOWS ARE AT AN ANGLE SMALLER TOWARDS THE BACK GIVING LESS VISIBILITY SO YOU HAVE A BIGGER BLIND SPOT 
THE BACK END OF THE TRUCK SAT SO HIGH THAT YOU CANT SEE PEOPLE WALKING BEHIND VEHICLE WHEN YOUR NOT IN BACK UP MODE
THE BACK GLASS IS SMALL AND THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE SMALL CREATING BLIND SPOTS I WOULD NOT OWN THIS VEHICLE WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT ASSIST SYSTEM WISH WORKS GREAT 
THE BACK HEAD RESTS IN THE CONVERTIBLE ARE TOTALLY VISUALLY OBSTRUCTING THE VIEW HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO REMOVE THEM 
THE BACK HEAD RESTS TEND TO BE IN THE WAY WHEN THERE IS NO ONE IN THE THIRD ROW
THE BACK PANEL IS HARD TO SEE OVER WHEN LOOKING OUT BACK WINDOW RELY ON MIRRORS MOSTLY WHEN REVERSING
THE BACK PASSENGER WINDOWS ARE HIGH AND MAKE IT HARD TO SEE WHEN BACKING OUT 
THE BACK SEAT DOES NOT LIE DOWN FLAT CAN T BELIEVE THE CAR WAS DESIGNED THIS WAY 
THE BACK SEAT HEADREST BLOCK THE REAR VIEW TO SOME EXTENT 
THE BACK SEAT HEADREST CAN INTERFERE WITH REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY BUT THE ABILITY TO LOWER THEM AND LAY THEY FLATTER IS A TRUE BENEFIT
THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS BLOCK REAR VISIBILITY 
THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS OBSTRUCT SOME OF THE VIEW OUT THE REAR WINDOW 
THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS RESTRICT MY VIEW OF VEHICLES BEHIND ME SOMEWHAT
THE BACK SEATS SET A LITTLE HIGH
THE BACK SIDE WINDOWS ARE TOO SMALL ITS HARD TO SEE AND OBSTRUCT THE VIEW WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS IN THE SIDE MIRRORS 
THE BACK TRIANGULAR WINDOW OFTEN LOOKS LIKE A CAR IN MY LANE OTHER THAN THAT THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT
THE BACK UP CAM IS VERY COOL 
THE BACK UP CAMERA AND SCREEN ARE MUCH CLEARER AND LARGER THAN IN MANY OTHER VEHICLES I TEST DROVE WHICH AGAIN MAKE THE VEHICLE FEEL HIGH END 
THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THE 360 DEGREE BIRD S EYE VIEW OF THE AUTO WHILE IN REVERSE ARE BOTH BEYOND EXCEPTIONAL I WAITED FOR THIS CAR AND THE ELECTRONIC SAFETY FEATURES SURE ENOUGH WHEN I WAS A LITTLE TIRED WHILE DRIVING A COFFEE CUP ICON CAME 
THE BACK UP CAMERA COULD BE CLEARER
THE BACK UP CAMERA DOES NOT MAKE A SOUND WHEN YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO AN OBJECT IT IS LITERALLY JUST A CAMERA WITH NO WARNING SYSTEM 
THE BACK UP CAMERA DOESN T HAVE PARKING LINES
THE BACK UP CAMERA GETS DIRTY REALLY EASILY BUT SEEING OUT THE BACK WINDOW GOOD SO THE CAMERA ISN T A MUST TO LOOK AT 
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A GOOD ADDITION BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK THE FEATURE OF THE CAMERA LOOKING TO THE RIGHT REAR IS ALSO GOOD BUT EVEN WITH THIS FEATURE IT IS OFTEN HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ALL THE TRAFFIC IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE 
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A GREAT ASSET FOR DRIVING SAFETY!
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A GREAT FEATURE AND MAKE THE TRUCK EASIER TO PARK

THE BACK UP CAMERA IS PHENOMENAL! LOVE THE GUIDED LINES WHEN PARKING MY WIFE EVEN LIKES IT!
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL AND I LOVE THE SONAR FEATURE THAT BEEPS WHEN I GET TOO CLOSE TO SOMETHING 
THE BACK UP CAMERA MAKES BACKING UP A BREEZE
THE BACK UP CAMERA QUALITY IS TERRIBLE 
THE BACK UP CONTINUOUS BEEP IS A DISTRACTION WHILE IN REVERSE THE ONLY WAY TO ALTER THE CONTINUOUS NOISE IS TO DISABLE THE BACK UP ALERT 
THE BACK UP LIGHTS ARE SO DIM AS TO BE USELESS 
THE BACK UP SYSTEM COULD USE SOME BEEPS
THE BACK WINDOW COULD BE LARGER 
THE BACK WINDOW GETS DIRTY FASTER THAN THE CAR THE WIPERS DO NOT CLEAN THE PASSENGERS SIDE AS WELL AS THE DRIVERS IT SHOULD CLEAN EQUALLY AS WELL 
THE BACK WINDOW IS ON THE SMALLER SIDE AND DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER RAIN AND SNOW TEND TO ACCUMULATE ON IT WHICH REDUCES VISIBILITY SNOW ALSO TENDS TO PILE UP ON THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD WHEN USING THE WIPERS ALSO REDUCING VISIBILITY 
THE BACK WINDOW IS SMALL 
THE BACK WINDOW IS SMALLER AND CREATES DANGEROUS BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE BACK WINDOW IS SOMETIMES SMALL TO SEE OUT OF 
THE BACK WINDOW IS TOO SMALL IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT OF IT WHEN I AM BACKING INTO MY GARAGE 
THE BACK WINDOW SEEMS REALLY SMALL COMPARED TO THE FRONT WINDOW 
THE BACKLIGHTING OF THE SCREEN IS BAD SOMETIMES EXAMPLE WHEN I M DRIVING INTO WORK IN THE MORNING AND I MUST USE MY HEADLIGHTS AND I TRY TO ADJUST THE DIMNESS OF THE SCREEN IT IS EITHER TOO DIM OR TOO BRIGHT I DON T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS TO WOR 
THE BACKSEAT HEAD RESTS CUT DOWN VISIBILITY CONSIDERABLY WOULDN T IT BE GREAT IF THEY RETRACTED BY A DRIVER S PUSHBUTTON CONTROL INTO THE INSIDE OF THE BACK OF THE SEAT 
THE BACKSEAT HEADRESTS ARE AN IMPEDIMENT TO REAR VISIBILITY 
THE BACKSEAT HEADRESTS COMPLETELY BLOCK MY VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW I HAD TO TAKE THOSE OUT 
THE BACKSEAT MIDDLE SEAT BELT IS DIRECTLY IN THE LINE OF VISION THROUGH THE REAR VIEW I AM OK WITH IT NOW AS I HAVE GROWN USED TO IT BUT IT IS A DISTRACTION WHEN FIRST DRIVING 
THE BACKUP CAMERA
THE BACKUP CAMERA AND AT LEAST MINI MIRRORS SHOULD COME STANDARD AT ANY TRIM LEVEL 
THE BACKUP CAMERA AREA THAT SHIFTS WHEN THE WHEEL IS TURNED IS TERRIFIC 
THE BACKUP CAMERA DISPLAY IS HARD TO SEE WHEN IT S SUNNY 
THE BACKUP CAMERA DOES NOT WORK UNLESS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TURN ON WHEN YOU TURN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON TO USE THE MAP OR BACKUP CAMERA THE MUSIC COMES ON 
THE BACKUP CAMERA INCREASE THE VISIBILITY WHICH ADDS MORE SAFETY 
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS A GREAT FEATURE
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS A GREAT FEATURE AS IS THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS GLAD I GOT THE MODEL THAT HAD THOSE 
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS A REAL PLUS 
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS AWESOME!
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS SUPER!
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS USELESS AT NIGHT 
THE BACKUP CAMERA SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO SEE IN THE SUNLIGHT
THE BACKUP CAMERA STINKS
THE BACKUP CAMERA WORKS GREAT ESPECIALLY WHEN CONNECTING TO A TRAILER 
THE BACKUP CAMERA! WHEE!
THE BAND AND OLUFSON OPTIONAL SYSTEM IS THE MANUFACTURER S GIMMICK WHICH IS NOT WORTH FOR THE MONEY IT S MUCH INFERIOR THAN THE HARMAN KARDON SYSTEM ON MY MERCEDES THE QUALITY OF SOUND IS NO BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS BMW 335 BASIC SYSTEM 
THE BANG & OLUFSON STEREO SYSTEM WITH EXCEPTIONAL HI FIDELITY SOUND AND THE SURROUND SOUND QUALITY IT S LIKE DRIVING WITH A DJ HI FI GIG
THE BANG AND OLUFSON SOUND SYSTEM IS EXTRAORDINARY THE FINEST CAR AUDIO SYSTEM I HAVE PURCHASED 
THE BANS & OLUFSEN SOUNDS SYSTEM 
THE BAR ACROSS THE BACK HATCH DOES SOMEWHAT OBSTRUCT THE VIEW
THE BAR ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE REAR WINDOW TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO 
THE BAR ACROSS THE REAR HATCH DOOR IMPEDES VISIBILITY DIRECTLY TO THE REAR I LIKE THE STYLE OF THE VEHICLE BUT THIS FEELS LIKE AN ISSUE AN OPTION TO USE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA WHILE DRIVING AT TIMES WOULD BE NICE 
THE BAR AT THE BACK WINDOW BLOCKS VISIBILITY WITH REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THE BAR BETWEEN THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW AND THE REAR WINDOW IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN PULLING OUT OF A STREET ON A 45 DEGREE ANGLE IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE 
THE BAR BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND FRONT SIDE WINDER IS TOO FAT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHILE TURNING 
THE BAR BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE DRIVER DOOR IS ALWAYS A BLIND SPOT FOR ME I ALSO SHOULD USE A BLIND SPOT MIRROR BECAUSE I HAVE TO TURN AROUND TO SEE IF ANYONE IS IN THE NEXT LANE
THE BAR IN BETWEEN THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW AND FRONT WINDSHIELD MAKES IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE ESPECIALLY WHEN TURNING LEFT AROUND A TURN 
THE BAR IN THE BACK OVER THE CARGO AREA IMPEDES VISIBILITY 
THE BAR LEADING FROM THE ROOF TO THE HOOD IS THICK AND SOMETIMES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN MAKING A RIGHT TURN
THE BAR NEXT TO THE FRONT SMALL TRIANGULAR WINDOWS GETS IN THE WAY CAUSING A BLIND SPOT 
THE BAR ON EACH SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD IS KIND OF WIDE SOMETIMES I DO NOT SEE OTHER VEHICLES 
THE BARS BETWEEN THE FRONT AND SIDE WINDOWS ARE WIDE AND IMPAIR VISION OF ONCOMING VEHICLES FROM SIDE STREETS 
THE BARS FOR THE FRAME BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND SIDE WINDOWS ARE EXTREME BLIND SPOTS 
THE BASE
THE BASE AUDIO SYSTEM
THE BASE MODEL HAS NO INTERMITTENT WIPERS
THE BASE MODEL IS ADEQUATE THE HEAD UNIT AND SPEAKERS WILL BE REPLACED BY HIGHER QUALITY AFTERMARKET UNITS IN THE RELATIVELY NEAR FUTURE 
THE BASE RADIO IS ALMOST USELESS I KEEP THE MULTIFUNCTION DISPLAY ON THE RADIO PAGE MOST OF THE TIME SO I KNOW WHAT S HAPPENING WITH MY RADIO I OPTED NOT TO GET THE UPGRADED PACKAGE WITH NAVIGATION BECAUSE THE NAVIGATION LOOKED AND FELT CHEAP 
THE BASE SOUNDS RATTLE THE DOOR SPEAKERS NO MATTER HOW I ADJUST THE SYSTEM 
THE BASE SPEAKER LEVEL
THE BASIC MODEL COULD BE IMPROVED BY COMING STANDARD WITH BLUETOOTH OR VOICE ACTIVATED CONTROLS 
THE BASIC RADIO DOES NOT HAVE A CD PLAYER THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE 
THE BASIC SPEAKERS ARE OF RELATIVELY BELOW AVERAGE SOUND QUALITY
THE BASIC SPEAKERS THAT COME WITHE THE VEHICLE ARE ONLY OKAY 
THE BASIC SYSTEM I HAVE IS NOT THAT GREAT I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SELECT MUSIC FROM BLUETOOTH USB OR OTHERS AS THEY ALL SEEM TO BE SELECTED FROM THE SAME BUTTON MEDIA IF I REMEMBER WELL BY PRESSING REPEATED TIMES AND THERE IS NO VISUAL INDI 
THE BASS
THE BASS AND TREBLE CONTROLS COULD BE EASIER TO SEE AND FIND
THE BASS IS GREAT MUCH BETTER THAN I WAS EXPECTING OUT OF SUCH A TINY CAR I HAVE THE BASS BOOST FEATURE ON HIGH AND I LOVE THAT THE SCREEN OPENS UP LIKE YOU RE IN A JAMES BOND CAR TECHNICALLY THAT S TWO ASPECTS SORRY I GET MUCH MORE DAILY EN 
THE BASS IS HORRIBLE
THE BASS IS NOT AS PUNCHY AS IT COULD BE IT BECOMES MUFFLED/MUDDLED AND SOFT WHEN LOUD 
THE BASS IS WEAK FOR A UPGRADED RADIO
THE BASS OF MUSIC SYSTEM COULD BE EASIER TO USE AND STRONGER 
THE BASS OF THE SPEAKERS YOU COULD CHANGE DIFFERNT MODES TO HOW YOU WANT IT
THE BASS OR DEPTH OF THE MUSIC COULD BE INCREASED 
THE BASS THE BASS IS A BIT WEAK 
THE BEAM TO THE LEFT OF THE DRIVER IS TOO THICK 
THE BEATS STEREO SYSTEM SOUNDS GREAT FOR BEING A FACTORY SYSTEM I COULDN T INSTALL A BETTER ONE AT THAT PRICE FACTORY STEREO SYSTEMS HAVE COME A LONG WAY 
THE BEEPING REGARDING LANE CHANGES IS SOMETIMES UNNECESSARY AND ACTUALLY DISTRACTING OCCASIONALY BEEPS AND I CAN T FIGURE OUT WHY CAN BE STARTLING 
THE BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS ARE NOT VERY INTUITIVE TO USE AS THE BUTTONS USED FOR CHANGING SOURCES AND STATIONS ARE NOT PAIRED IN A PLUS/MINUS CONFIGURATION RATHER THEY ONLY TOGGLE CHANGES IN ONE DIRECTION SO IF YOU WANT TO GO BACKWA 
THE BELT STUMBLES
THE BENDING HEADLAMPS ARE A VERY USEFUL FEATURE
THE BERMESTER SOUND SYSTEM IS TERRIFIC 
THE BESPOKE APPLICATION SHOULD NOT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO PURCHASE SEPARATELY IT SHOULD BE INCLUDED INTO THE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE ALONG WITH THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO OPT OUT OF HAVING IT IF YOU WANTED SO YOU DON T HAVE TO PAY T 
THE BEST AVAILABLE FACTORY CAR AUDIO SYSTEM
THE BEST BLUETOOTH VOICE RECOGNITION AND INTERFACE OUT OF ANY VEHICLE I HAVE HAD THUS FAR 
THE BEST CAR I EVER OWNED KIDS LOVE NEIGHBOR GOT IN AND SAID WAS LIKE BEING IN LIVING ROOM PLEASURE TO DRIVE SPACE IS VERY WELL USED 
THE BEST EVERY DAY DRIVER SUPER CAR ON THE MARKET THAT ALSO HAS A BACK SEAT FOR MY SON I HAVE DRIVEN THIS CAR IN 14 INCHES OF SNOW WITH NO PROBLEM WITH SNOW TIRES OF COURSE BEST VEHICLE ON THE PLANET PERIOD 
THE BEST FEATURE IS DESTINATION ASSIST 
THE BEST HEADLIGHTS I EVER HAD ON ANY CAR I VE OWNED
THE BEST HIGHLIGHTS I HAVE EVER USED THEY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT 
THE BEST I VE EVER EXPERIENCED ALL THE WAY AROUND 
THE BEST PHONE SYSTEM IN ANY CAR I HAVE EVER HAD THOSE ON THE LINE CANNOT BELIEVE I AM ON BLUE TOOTH IN THE CAR!
THE BEST SYSTEM WE HAVE EVER HEARD IN ANY CAR THAT WE HAVE OWNED 
THE BEST THING EVER CREATED WAS THE LITTLE LIGHT ASSIST ON THE SIDE MIRRORS WHEN CARS ARE NEAR ME AND I CAN T CHANGE A LANE MAKES ME FEEL MUCH SAFER WITH MY BABY IN MY CAR WHEN I NEED TO CHANGE A LANE 
THE BEST THING YOU COULD DO WOULD BE TO 1 INCORPORATE THE APP WAZE AND 2 IMPROVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE WHY CAN T I SIMPLY SAY GO HOME AND IT KNOWS THAT I WANT TO GO HOME? VERY FRUSTRATING 
THE BEST VEHICLE I EVER PURCHASED SINCE I OWNED AND KNOWN CARS BEST DRIVEN EVER KEEP GOING HIGH SUBARU
THE BEST VEHICLE I HAVE DRIVEN IN YEARS
THE BEST YET OF ANY F150 I HAVE OWNED
THE BETTER THAN I HAVE IN MY HOUSE SOUND SYSTEM 
THE BI XENON HEADLIGHTS ARE THE BEST I VE EVER HAD BETTER THAN THE 2012 GTI AND MY 2004 SAAB AERO 
THE BIG DRAWBACK IS REAR VISIBILITY THE REAR ROOF COLUMNS ARE THICK AND SLOPING AND RESULT IN POOR SIGHTLINES TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT REAR SINCE MY CAR LACKS THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS OR OTHER ELECTRONICS THAT WOULD MINIMIZE THIS PROBLEM THE P 
THE BIG KNOB IS A PAIN AS YOU CANNOT SIT ANYTHING ON THE CONSOLE AS IT HITS THE KNOB
THE BIG MIRRORS ARE GREAT MY REAR COMPARTMENT IS FULL OF DOG CRATES AND SUCH AND I CAN T SEE MUCH THRU THE REAR WINDSHIELD A VISOR EXTENSION THAT SLIDES IN AND OUT WOULD HELP
THE BIG PROBLEM IS THE CD PLAYER IS HIDDEN AND A HASSLE TO PLAY CD S
THE BIG SCREEN MAKES IT EASY TO USE 
THE BIG SCREEN!
THE BIG XL SCREEN AND SOUND 
THE BIGGEST CHANGE THAT HYUNDAI NEEDS TO MAKE ON THIS CAR IS THE ABILITY TO USE AUDIO CONTROLS THEN SWITCH TO PHYSICALLY USING THE TOUCH SCREEN 
THE BIGGEST ISSUE I HAVE IS THAT THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOICE COMMANDS RARELY WORK IF EVER THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED 
THE BIGGEST ISSUE I VE HAD IS THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IS CLUNKY IN ITS MENU SETUPS AND SLOW IN ITS PROCESSING WHICH COMBINES WITH THE FREQUENT RECOGNITION MISTAKES TO MAKE ME AVOID USING IT ENTIRELY 
THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE LACK OF DATA CONNECTIVITY SPEED COMING FROM THE BUILT IN T MOBILE 3G DEVICE IT MAKES ALL OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE COMMUNICATION INTERFACES PROVIDED IN THE VEHICLE LOOK USELESS THEY SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED THE OPTION OF LTE 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE IS THE OUTSIDE MIRROR ON PASSENGER AND MOVING INTO ANOTHER LANE CAN T SEE THE VEHICLE COMING UNTIL IS RIGHT UPON YOU WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE FROM LEFT LANE TO RIGHT LANE 
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE HAD IS WITH THE MANUAL IT HAS SO MANY INSTRUCTIONS FOR SO MANY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE TROUBLE FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHAT WE DO HAVE AND HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK 
THE BIGGEST SAFETY CONCERN I HAVE IS OTHER DRIVERS SEEING ME WHEN THEY CHANGE LANES 
THE BLACK PANEL IN THE CENTER OF THE WINDSHIELD IS DISTRACTING AND TOO LARGE 
THE BLADE SPOT AND JUST THE OVERALL READ VISIBILITY IS POOR 
THE BLIND AREA ARE A BIT DIFFERENT IN THIS NEW VEHICLE WAS IN A MUSTANG BEFORE OVERALL VERY GOOD VIABILITY A LITTLE LESS GOOD WHEN MERGING IN LANES OF TRAFFIC 
THE BLIND SIDE MIRRORS ARE A GREAT ADDITION 
THE BLIND SPOT ALERT FEATURE IS AN OUTSTANDING FEATURE I THINK IT SHOULD BE STANDARD ON EVERY VEHICLE 
THE BLIND SPOT AND BACKING UP SENSORS MAKE THE VEHICLE WORK IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE REAR CAMERA WHEN NOT IN REVERSE COMING FROM A TRUCK I HAVE TO GET USED TO THE FORWARD BLIND SPOTS OF A PASSENGER CAR AGAIN 
THE BLIND SPOT AND BACKUP MONITORS ARE GREAT!
THE BLIND SPOT AND LANE CHANGE SYSTEMS ARE EXCELLENT!
THE BLIND SPOT ASSIST IS EXCEPTIONAL BOTH THE VISIBLE INDICATIONS AND AUDIBLE WARNINGS A GREAT SYSTEM!
THE BLIND SPOT BETWEEN FRONT WINDOW AND SIDE WINDOWS
THE BLIND SPOT BLIND SPOT SIDE MIRRORS WOULD BE GREAT FOR THIS CAR 
THE BLIND SPOT CAMERA UNDER THE RIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS REALLY HELPFUL 
THE BLIND SPOT CENSORS ARE A GOD S SEND!!
THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM AND THE REAR BACK UP/ COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM AS INSTALLED ON OUR VEHICLE IS A MUST FOR THE SANTA FE DESIGN! WE LOVE THEM AND USE THEM ALWAYS 
THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR IS QUITE EFFECTIVE 
THE BLIND SPOT FEATURE IS AN EXCELLENT SAFETY OPTION 
THE BLIND SPOT FOR CHANGING LANES SEEMS TO BE GREATER THAN FOR MY PREVIOUS 1996 CAMRY I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING OVER THE HOOD WHEN DRIVING UP/DOWN A HILL I M GOING TO TRY RAISING THE SEAT TO SEE IF THAT HELPS MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE THE REAR V 
THE BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVER SEAT OUT THE FRONT WINDOW CREATED BY THE CAR FRAME ON LEFT SIDE OF FRONT WINDOW CAN BE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AT TIMES 
THE BLIND SPOT IN THE DRIVER S SIDE REAR MIRROR SEEMS LARGER THAN WHAT I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ON PREVIOUS VEHICLES 
THE BLIND SPOT IN THE OTHER SONATAS WE VED HAD HAS BEEN MUCH WORSE THAN THIS ONE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR ON THE SIDE MIRROR HELPS 
THE BLIND SPOT IN THE PRIUS IS DANGEROUS!!
THE BLIND SPOT IN THIS CAR ARE TERRIBLE 
THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS SOMETIMES ALERT ME WHEN THERE ISN T A VEHICLE PRESENT 
THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS WORK VERY WELL AND ARE EXTREMELY HELPFUL AS ARE ALL THE OTHER WARNINGS SUCH AS THE VIBRATION IN THE SEAT WHEN YOU CROSS THE YELLOW OR WHITE LINE
THE BLIND SPOT IS A BIT ANNOYING AND RATHER LARGE 
THE BLIND SPOT IS AN ISSUE 
THE BLIND SPOT IS BAD HARD TO SEE TO CHANGE LANES 
THE BLIND SPOT IS BAD U CANT SEE THE CARS IN THE LEFT LANE AND IF U TRY TO PASS AND ONE IS THERE U CANT SEE THEM AND I ALMOST SIDE SWIPED A CAR BECAUSE I COULDN T SEE IT
THE BLIND SPOT IS BIGGER THAN I D LIKE 
THE BLIND SPOT IS BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO BE AND REAR VIEW A LITTLE CONSTRAINED 
THE BLIND SPOT IS EXAGGERATED BY THE SHAPE OF THE SIDE WINDOWS I ALWAYS FEEL AS IF I CAN T SEE EVERYTHING ON MY SIDES 
THE BLIND SPOT IS HUGE FOR SHORT PEOPLE
THE BLIND SPOT IS SCARY
THE BLIND SPOT IS THE ONE SPOT THAT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WITH THE THICKNESS AND LOCATION OF THE FRAME OF THE CAR BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR WINDOW NOT SO MUCH ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BUT ON THE DRIVER SIDE WHEN CHECKING THE LEFT BLIND SPOT NEED C 
THE BLIND SPOT IS TOO LARGE
THE BLIND SPOT IS TRICKY I REALLY HAVE TO TURN MY HEAD AND TAKE A GOOD LOOK TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO ONCOMING CAR 
THE BLIND SPOT IS VERY BAD
THE BLIND SPOT IS VERY BAD IN THIS VEHICLE I HAVE ALMOST HAD SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE ANOTHER CAR ALONG SIDE OF THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE LANES BAD BLIND SPOT!
THE BLIND SPOT LANE CHANGING VISIBILITY IS AWESOME!
THE BLIND SPOT LIGHT IS SO HELPFUL AND NOT OBTRUSIVE LIKE BEEPS OR OTHER NOISES WOULD BE 
THE BLIND SPOT LIGHTS ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE VERY HELPFUL ESPECIALLY IN FREEWAY TRAFFIC 
THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR DRIVERS SIDE IS NOT ADEQUATE I ACTUALLY PLACED A STICK ON CONVEX SHAPED MIRROR WHICH GIVES ME FAR BETTER VISIBILITY 
THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON MY SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS A GREAT FEATURE 
THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS WAS ADJUSTABLE WOULD BE NICE AND A BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE TOO 
THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR S ARE A PROBLEM FOR ME WHEN I PASS VEHICLES THE ROUND SPOT MIRROR UP IN THE CORNER BLOCKS MY VISION SO I CAN T TELL IF I HAVE CLEARED THE VEHICLE I AM PASSING LIKED THE PREVIOUS MIRRORS BETTER 
THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE A NICE TOUCH
THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE VERY HELPFUL 
THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS ARE A GREAT ADDITION FOR SAFETY AND VISIBILITY 
THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS THAT WERE BUILT IN ARE NOW GONE NOT ALL VEHICLES HAVE THE SENSORS
THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR
THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR HELPS BUT THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS 
THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS A PLUS HOWEVER VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES CAN BE A PROBLEM 
THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS TERRIFIC DON T KNOW WHAT I DID WITHOUT IT!
THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS WONDERFUL
THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC SIGNALS ARE VERY HELPFUL AND MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT THE CAR
THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING DOES A GREAT JOB OF COMPENSATING FOR THE REAR COLUMN AND THE PARKING ASSIST SYSTEM HAS WARNED ME SEVERAL TIMES OF DRIVERS SPEEDING PAST AS I BACK OUT OF A PARKING SPOT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE DIMMING OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIR 
THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS GOOD BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE HUGE BLIND SPOTS IN THIS CAR OUT THE FRONT SIDE AND REAR SIDE 
THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE FOR PROMOTING SAFE DRIVING AND AVOIDING ACCIDENTS THE BACK CROSS TRAFFIC WARNING SYSTEM IS ALSO A TREMENDOUS SAFETY FEATURE IN PARKING LOTS AS IS THE BACK UP CAMERA 
THE BLIND SPOT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM AND FORWARD VISIBILITY ARE EXCELLENT ON THIS VEHICLE 
THE BLIND SPOT ON EACH SIDE IS LARGER THAN I WOULD PREFER
THE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVE SIDE IS LARGE I HAVE MADE LANE CHANGES TO THE LEFT CUTTING OFF PEOPLE BECAUSE I COULDN T SEE THEM 
THE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE BETWEEN DRIVER AND REAR IT WOULD HELP IF ALL VEHICLES HAD INDICATORS OF VEHICLES BESIDE YOU 
THE BLIND SPOT ON THE MUSTANG IS BAD I HAVE TO RELY ON THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS A LOT 
THE BLIND SPOT ON THE NEW EQUINOX SEEMS LIKE A LOT BIGGER THAN MY 06 I AM NOT SURE IF THE HEAD REST IS BIGGER OR IF THE REAR/TRUNK WINDOWS ARE SMALLER OR IF THE GAP FROM THE FRONT DOORS TO THE BACK DOORS ARE WHAT BLOCKS THE VIEW BUT IF FEELS LIK 
THE BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGERS SIDE IS AN ISSUE FOR ME THE REAR AREA BLOCKS MY VIEW A LITTLE MORE THAN I WOULD LIKE IT TO I AM GETTING USED TO IT HOWEVER THE NEWER AIRODINAMIC DESIGN WITH THE CAR ROOF LOWER TO THE GROUND TAKES A LITTLE TO 
THE BLIND SPOT SENSORS ARE INVALUABLE BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH LIMITED VISIBILITY IN THE DRIVERS SEAT BEHIND YOU THEY ARE A LIFE SAVER AND I D LIKELY HAVE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT WITHOUT THEM THEY SHOULD BE STANDARD ON THE VEHICLE
THE BLIND SPOT SIGN THE TRIANGLE ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR SHOULD HAVE A BRIGHTER APPEARANCE AND FLASH MORE THE WAY IT IS IT S NOT EASY TO NOTICE SPECIALLY DURING THE DAYLIGHT ALSO IT S BEEN VERY HARD TO MY HUSBAND THAT IS SLIGHTLY COLOR BLIND 
THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK AT LOWER SPEEDS LIKE IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC
THE BLIND SPOT TO THE DRIVER S FRONT RIGHT IS QUITE LARGE AND IS LARGE ENOUGH TO HIDE A VEHICLE IN AS THE DRIVER PREPARES TO MAKE A LEFT TURN 
THE BLIND SPOT TO THE RIGHT REAR IS STILL JUST AS BAD AS ALWAYS HOWEVER THE BLINDSPOT WARNING SYSTEM IN THIS VEHICLE IS A GODSEND 
THE BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS GREAT I M ALWAYS ON THE HIGHWAY AND I VE NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES 
THE BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT DUE TO THE WAY SEATS AND WINDOWS ARE ARRANGED 
THE BLIND SPOT WARNING IS A BLESSING 
THE BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHTS ARE THE BEST THING TO EVER COME OUT 
THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS A REAL LIFE SAVER 
THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS A STROKE OF GENIUS AND MAKES DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY SO MUCH SAFER AND MORE PLEASURABLE 
THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS VERY HELPFUL AND SHOULD BE ON EVERY CAR 
THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS ARE AN AMAZING ASPECT
THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS REALLY HELP 
THE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES IS REALLY BAD
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE A BIT OBSTRUCTIVE BUT NOT TOO WORRISOME 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE BAD! THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE ESSENTIAL TO MAKE ANE CHANGES SAFELY 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE BIG IN THIS CAR I REALLY WISH IT HAD BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND REAR TRAFFIC ALERT AT LEAST LOVE THE LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY AND ITS SHARPNESS AND STABILITY AROUND THE CORNERS
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE GETTING BETTER MY GIRLFRIEND OWNS A 2010 SOUL WHICH HAS MUCH LARGER BLIND SPOTS BUT I STILL HAVE SOME VISIBILITY ISSUES WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE HARD TO CHECK BY LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT I AM 5 2 WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SEE OUT THE BACK AND OVER MY SHOULDERS WHILE CHANGING LANES 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE HUGE BUT THE LIGHTS IN THE SIDE MIRRORS HELPS TREMENDOUSLY
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE HUGE YOU COULD HAVE AN 18 WHEELER IN THE AREA BETWEEN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND THE WINDSHIELD AND NOT SEE IT
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE JUST AS BAD WITH THIS CAR AS IT IS SITTING IN AN SUV AND YOU CANNOT SEE THE TRAFFIC BEHIND YOU WELL BECAUSE THE REAR HEADRESTS TAKE UP VISUAL SPACE OF THE REAR WINDOW
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE KIND OF TRICKY AT FIRST BUT THE EXTRA MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR REALLY HELPS YOU TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN T SEE FROM PHYSICALLY TURNING AROUND WHEN MERGING LANES FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE ACTUAL 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGER THAN I M USED TO BUT I THINK THAT S JUST RELATIVE TO MY HEIGHT AND POSITION IN THE PICKUP 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THAN IN MY 2005 CLASSIC 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE NOT EASY TO CHECK DUE TO THE SMALL SIDE REAR WINDOWS AND LARGE CORNER POSTS 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BIG I WISH MY REARVIEW MIRROR SHOWED MY DIRECTION AS THE COMPASS ON THE NAV SCREEN IS SMALL AND ONLY DESIGNATES NORTH ALSO I WISH I HAD REAR WIPERS 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BIG THE SIDE MIRRORS BLOCK SIGHT WHEN YOU ARE TUNING 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE REALLY BAD IN THIS CAR I COULDN T IMAGINE DRIVING IT WITHOUT THE ELECTRONIC ASSISTANCE 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE REALLY BED WHEN CHANGING LANES OR BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPOTS 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY APPARENT WITH THIS VEHICLE BUT THEY ARE NOT REALLY A PROBLEM WITH THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR SYSTEM 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE WITHOUT PRACTICE 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHILE DRIVING WITHOUT THE LDA ITS A PAIN DRIVING THIS VEHICLE 
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY LARGE DUE TO THE SIDE MIRRORS AND DESIGN
THE BLIND SPOTS AREN T TERRIBLE BUT THEY RE NOT TOO GREAT EITHER IT MAKES ME BE EXTRA CAUTIOUS WHEN SWITCHING LANES 
THE BLIND SPOTS BETWEEN THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS AND REAR WINDOW ARE WAY TOO BIG 
THE BLIND SPOTS ON THIS CAR ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS 
THE BLIND SPOTS ON THIS CAR ARE PRETTY BAD THERE IS LITTLE MORE THAN THE OPTION OF USING SIDE VIEW MIRRORS BECAUSE A DIRECT VIEW OF THE RIGHT HAND BLIND SPOT IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO HOW THE CAR IS CONSTRUCTED 
THE BLIND SPOTS OUT THE REAR AND RIGHT SIDE ARE MORE THAN I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH ANY OTHER CAR I THINK BACK UP SENSORS SHOULD BE STANDARD IN A CAR I REALLY MISS THEM FROM MY LAST CAR 
THE BLIND SPOTS OVER MY SHOULDERS ARE BAD
THE BLIND SPOTS SEEM BIGGER ON THIS CAR LAST CAR WAS A MADZA MPV AND I HAD TO REPLACE THE WIPERS WITH A BETTER QUALITY BLADE BUT PASSENGER SIDE DOES NOT GET CLEARED ENOUGH WITH CURRENT PATTERN OF WIPING THE OLD MADZA SWEPT FROM THE INSIDE TO 
THE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHECKING OVER MY SHOULDER ARE A BIT LARGE BECAUSE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PIECE THAT CONNECTS THE ROOF TO THE CAR OTHER THAN THAT VISIBILITY DIRECTLY IN FRONT BEHIND AND TO THE SIDES ARE JUST FINE 
THE BLINDSPOT DETECTION DOES NOT SEEM TO COME ON AS SOON AS IT SHOULD 
THE BLINDSPOT MONITOR LANE DEPARTURE CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT AND PARKING ASSIST BEEPERS ALL WORK WELL AND ARE GREAT SAFETY FEATURES
THE BLINDSPOT SENSORS ARE GREAT THE FRONT AND REAR SENSORS FOR BUMPING INTO THINGS MAY BE A LITTLE TOO SENSITIVE 
THE BLINDSPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS A MUST AS THE BLINDSPOT IS VERY BIG WITH THIS VEHICLE
THE BLINDSPOTS IN THE CAR ARE QUITE APPARENT THERE IS A POST THE OBSCURES MY VIEW OF THESE SPOTS 
THE BLINDSPOTS OF THIS VEHICLE ARE SMALL/ALMOST NON EXISTENT 
THE BLINKER CAN BE HEARD WHEN I AM TALKING ON THE PHONE WHILE IN THE TRUCK
THE BLIS IS GREAT AND IN LANE CONTROL
THE BLIS MONITORING IS AMAZING WILL NEVER HAVE A CAR WITHOUT IT AGAIN 
THE BLISS IS WONDERFUL WHEN DRIVING IN TRAFFIC YOU DON T HAVE TO SECOND GUESS IF YOU CAN CHANGE LANES OR NOT AND THE BACK UP CAMERA GIVES A GREAT VIEW WHEN BACKING UP AND THE CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT IS GREAT IF YOU ARE IN A TIGHT SPOT WHERE YOU CAN T 
THE BLUE LINK PHONE QUICKLY CONNECTS AND IS READY TO USE WITHOUT A PROBLEM 
THE BLUE TOOTH CAME BE IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF UNDERSTANDING AND HEARING THE PERSON U ARE TALKING TO 
THE BLUE TOOTH CONNECTION IS FANTASTIC I VE NEVER HAD A CAR WITH THIS FEATURE BEFORE AND I M DELIGHTED WITH HOW EASY IT WAS TO SET AND IS TO USE WHAT A WONDERFUL SAFETY FEATURES! THE STEREO SYSTEM HAS TERRIFIC SOUND QUALITY 
THE BLUE TOOTH CONNECTION WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THE WORD YES WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A CALL 
THE BLUE TOOTH DOESN T LIKE IPODS YOU CANNOT PLAY MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH FROM THEM ALSO THE USB PORT THING WHEN HOOKING TO A NEWER IPOD YEA IT S PRETTY SHITTY AS WELL THIS IS THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE ABOUT THE CAR 
THE BLUE TOOTH FEATURE IS AWESOME 
THE BLUE TOOTH FEATURE IS HARD TO HEAR NO ONE CAN HEAR ME ON THE THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PHONE
THE BLUE TOOTH FOR MY PHONE IS VERY CLEAR THE RADIO IS EASY TO USE AND THE SOUND IS GREAT 
THE BLUE TOOTH HAND FREE PHONE 
THE BLUE TOOTH HANDS FREE OPTION FOR THE PHONE HAS VASTLY IMPROVED! REALLY LOVE THE VISUALS WHILE PLAYING THE RADIO NOW TOO 
THE BLUE TOOTH HAS A VERY LONG DELAY WHEN USING THE PHONE BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL THAT IS ANNOYING 
THE BLUE TOOTH HAS GREAT RECEPTION WHEN I MAKE AND RECEIVE PHONE CALLS I CAN HEAR THE OTHER CALLER CRYSTAL CLEAR 
THE BLUE TOOTH HAS NEVER WORKED 
THE BLUE TOOTH IS EASY TO CONNECT WITH I LIKE THAT IT TURNS THE RADIO OFF/MUTES IT AS SOON AS YOU GET READY TO CONNECT TO BLUETOOTH 
THE BLUE TOOTH IS VERY CLEAR
THE BLUE TOOTH IT WASN T UNTIL I GOT THE CAR THAT I KNEW SOMETHING THAT EXISTED 
THE BLUE TOOTH PHONE CAPACITY IS AMAZING TO ME I SOMETIMES HAVE DIFFICULTY HEARING ON THE PHONE AND WHEN SPEAKING ON THE PHONE IN THE CAR THE VOICE IS VERY CRISP CLEAR AND VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS COMPONENT BEFORE AND I 
THE BLUE TOOTH PHONE IT SOMETIMES DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE COMMAND OR NUMBER TO BE CALLED PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY HEARING ME WHEN I SPEAK TO THEM THERE SHOULD BE SPEAKERS IN THE THIRD ROW SEATING FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM I D 
THE BLUE TOOTH PHONE SYSTEM
THE BLUE TOOTH SOUND IS FANTASTIC AND THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE VERY EASY TO USE 
THE BLUE TOOTH SYSTEM IS HARD TO WORK WITH SOME TIME S 
THE BLUE TOOTH SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY MY CHEVROLETS SYSTEM IS FAR SUPERIOR
THE BLUE TOOTH TELEPHONE HOOKUP IS EXCEPTIONAL FOR PHONE AND MUSIC 
THE BLUE TOOTH WORKS PERFECT!
THE BLUE TOOTH YOU CAN T ET YOUR PHONE TO GO THEY THE VANS BLUE TOOTH AND GET MESSAGES OR SEND
THE BLUELINK NAVIGATION TAKES THIS RATING MUCH LOWER THAN IT SHOULD DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FUNCTION OF IT AND THE PRICE DON T THEY KNOW CELL PHONES HAVE APPS THAT ARE BETTER THAN THEIR SYSTEM?
THE BLUETEC VERSION WAS DEFIANTLY WORTH THE EXTRA COST AS WE HAVE SAVED SO MUCH FROM HE EXTRA MPG AND THE 4 MATIC ALL WHEEL DRIVE THAT IS BUILT INTO THE BLUETEC VERSION IS WONDERFUL THERE ISN T ANY WEATHER CONDITION I HAVE DRIVEN IN THAT I HAVEN 
THE BLUETOOTH
THE BLUETOOTH AND HAND FREE DO NOT WORK WELL AND ARE A MESS
THE BLUETOOTH ASKS IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS CALL WHEN YOU ASKS IT TO CALL SOMEONE IT IS REDUNDANT 
THE BLUETOOTH ASPECT OF IT IS NOT GREAT PEOPLE I TALK TO SAY THEY CAN BARLY UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TALK 
THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO FEATURE IS NOT GREAT YOU CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC ON THE IPHONE VIA BLUETOOTH BUT CAN T SEE THE PLAYLIST ON THE TOUCH SCREEN SO YOU HAVE TO CHANGE MUSIC ON THE PHONE 
THE BLUETOOTH CALLING FEATURE IS VERY ECHO Y AND NOT GREAT SOUND QUALITY IT DOES NOT INTEGRATE WITH MY PHONE S ADDRESS BOOK 
THE BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY IS VERY HELPFUL I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE VOICE CONTROL WHEN I NEED TO CALL SOMEONE THIS WAS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY AND I AM VERY IMPRESSED 
THE BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY IS WHAT I USE AND APPRECIATE MOST 
THE BLUETOOTH COMPATIBILITY WORKS VERY SEAMLESSLY BETWEEN MY PHONE AND THE RADIO I CAN LISTEN TO CALLS LISTEN TO MY TEXT MESSAGES AND CHANGE THE MUSIC ALL WITHOUT TOUCHING MY PHONE AT ALL LEAVING BOTH OF MY HANDS ON THE WHEEL
THE BLUETOOTH CONECTIVITY IS SEEMLESS AND IT SAVES ALL OF MY DRIVER PREFERNCES TO THE DEVICE I USE 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION GETS LOST OFTEN AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO KEEP SETTING IT UP 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION HAS DOWNLOADED MY 1000+ CONTACTS AND WHEN I CONNECT THE PHONE IT RE DOWNLOADS THEM AGAIN I NEED TO DELETE THEM ALL AND START OVER I THINK THERE S MUCH MORE THAT THE SYSTEM CAN DO BUT I AM NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT YET 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION HAS SOME NOISE THAT CAN BE HEARD ONLY BY THE PERSON YOU ARE CALLING THIS NOISE IS NOT HEARD BY ME THE CALLER 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS LOST AT TIMES IF THAT WERE MORE STABLE THE SYSTEM WOULD BE PERFECT 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS USED DAILY AND IT HAS VERY GOOD SOUND QUALITY THE CHILDREN LOVE LOVE LOVE THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM AND THEY ARE QUIET ON LONG DRIVES BECAUSE THEY CAN WATCH THEIR FAVORITE SHOWS 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED IT S VERY SCRATCHY AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS SO BAD I REFUSE TO USE IT 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION OF YOUR SMARTPHONE 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO MY IPHONE IS GREAT I CAN ALWAYS HEAR AND UNDERSTAND THE CALLER AND THEY CAN ALWAYS HEAR AND UNDERSTAND ME IT S A LOT SAFER USING THIS FEATURE FOR PHONE CALLS THAN IT IS TO JUST USE MY PHONE WHEN DRIVING 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO MY PHONE IS INCREDIBLE BECAUSE I JUST HAVE TO SAY WHO I WANT TO CALL RATHER THAN HAVING TO DICTATE THE NUMBER ALSO THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS AMAZING I RECENTLY GAVE IT AN ADDRESS THAT I WAS 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO MY PHONE IS MY FAVORITE FEATURE IT MAKES PLACING AND RECEIVING CALLS EASIER AND MUCH SAFER 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY AND HOW EASY IT IS TO USE 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY ASIDE FROM THE PHONE IS TERRIBLE SO ALL OF THOSE FEATURES WHICH SEEM GREAT! ARE UNUSABLE!!!!

THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WHILE GOOD THAT IT S STRONG HAS PICKED UP SPOUSE S PHONE WHILE IN ANOTHER CAR 
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WITH MY PHONE AND THE EASE OF USE THROUGH THE VEHICLES SYSTEM

THE BLUETOOTH PAIRING FEATURE IS VERY EASY TO USE IT HAS NEVER LOST THE CONNECTION TO MY PHONE 
THE BLUETOOTH PHONE ANSWERING BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO AS IT S COUNTER INTUITIVE PHONE ANSWERING OPERATION SHOULD BE A HORIZONTAL OPERATION WHEN YOU ANSWER OR MAKE A CALL ONE NORMALLY HITS THE RIGHT SIDE TO CONNEC 
THE BLUETOOTH PHONE AUDIO QUALITY IS BAD 
THE BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTION IS EASY TO USE AND SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT

THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM ONLY ALLOWS ONE OUT OF 5 DEVICE CONNECTIONS AT ONCE I WOULD LIKE TO USE MY PHONE FOR CALLS AND A 2ND BLUETOOTH DEVICE FOR MP3 PLAYBACK WITH THE PHONE AS THE PRIMARY CONNECTION 
THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM WHEN MAKING PHONE CALLS 
THE BLUETOOTH TAKES A WHILE TO GET CONNECTED AND IT TAKES A LITTLE TOO MUCH TIME FOR THE CD TO LOAD
THE BLUETOOTH THE CLEAR AND CONCISE CONVERSATIONS ON MY PHONE CALLS 
THE BLUETOOTH USE FOR MAKING PHONE CALLS ITS ANOTHER EXTENSION OF MY OFFICE 
THE BLUETOOTH VOICE SYSTEM HAS TOO MANY STEPS AND TOO MANY QUESTIONS AND CONFIRMATIONS I HAVE DRIVEN OTHER VEHICLES WHERE ALL I HAD TO DO WAS SAY CALL [NAME] HOME OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT AND IT DID IT ON THIS VEHICLE AND OTHER JAGS THA 
THE BLUETOOTH WILL NOT CONNECT TO PANDORA OR GIVE ME STEP BY STEP NAVIGATION THROUGH THE SPEAKERS 
THE BLUETOOTH WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY
THE BLUETOOTH WORKS REALLY WELL MY LAST CAR NO ONE COULD UNDERSTAND ME 
THE BLUETOOTH WORKS VERY WELL FOR PHONE CALLS

THE BMW IPHONE APP NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED IT DOES NOT TELL ME ANYTHING IMPORTANT AND IS DIFFICULT TO SYNC AND UPDATE WITH THE CAR S SYSTEMS 
THE BODY DESIGN HAS INHERENT FLAWS BUT I ACCEPT THE CAR FOR WHAT IT IS AND I DO ENJOY IT 
THE BODY SHAPE THE DOOR AND FRAME PART HOLDING THE WINDSHIELD IN PLACE AND THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR PROHIBIT A BIT OF VISIBILITY BUT THAT IS A SMALL LIMITATION AND THE REST OF THE VISITIBLITY IS GREAT 
THE BOOK IS TOO CUMBERSOME IT NEEDS A QUICK START MANUAL OF NO MORE THAN 4 PAGES
THE BOSE AUDIO SYSTEM AS INSTALLED IN CORVETTES IS THE WORST AVAILABLE IN ANY CAR PERIOD IT RATES AN F THE AUDIO SYSTEM IN OUR TWO LEXUS RX 350S ONE THE STANDARD AUDIO SYSTEM THE OTHER THE LEVINSON AUDIO SYSTEM ARE BOTH BETTER THAN THE BOS 
THE BOSE IS RIGHT ON FOR THE SPACE PERFECT
THE BOSE SOUND IS OVER THE TOP GOOD MY I PHONE 6 AUTOMATICALLY GOES TO THE SCREEN AND CONNECTS FAST EVEN THE FM IS GREAT SOUNDING I CANNOT BELIEVE THE HOW QUIET THIS TRUCK IS GOING DOWN THE ROAD AT 70MPH AND NOT HAVING TO TURN UP THE VOLUME AT 
THE BOSE SOUND SYSTEM
THE BOSE SOUND SYSTEM ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE BLUETOOTH CAPABLE

THE BOTTONS I HAVE TO PRESS IN WITH MY THUMB SIDEWAYS AND I FIND THAT TERRIBLE
THE BOXES THAT HAVE TO BE TOUCHED TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM ARE TOO SMALL MOST OF THE TIME I INADVERDANTLY HIT THE WRONG BOX AND GET AN UNDESIRED RESULT ALSO CHANGING STATIONS OR TRYING OTHER THINGS REQUIRE EYES OFF THE ROAD TOO LONG CREATING A DANG 
THE BRACKET THAT HOLDS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A DISTRACTION TO ME
THE BRAKES AND VISIBILITY ARE OUTSTANDING AND ASSIST IN AVOIDING ACCIDENTS 
THE BRAKES ARE A LITTLE TOO SENSITIVE
THE BRAKES ARE AMAZING STOPS THE CAR QUICKLY WHEN NEEDED 
THE BRAKES ARE FANTASTIC! WHILE THE CVT COULD PERFORM BETTER IT HAS A QUICK RESPONSE WHEN NEEDED AND CRUISES FANTASTIC AT SPEED 
THE BRAKES ARE GREAT STOPS YOU ON A DIME 
THE BRAKES COULD BE IMPROVED 
THE BRAKES TAKE A LOT OF PRESSURE BEFORE IT FEELS LIKE THE SUV IS SLOWING DOWN MUCH
THE BRAKING SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE 
THE BRAND SHOULD PROVIDE MORE SAFETY FEATURES AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT SUCH AS REAR VIEW CAMERAS LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM AND EMERGENCY BRAKING 
THE BRIGHT LIGHTS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE
THE BRIGHT LIGHTS DO NOT SEEM AS BRIGHT AS THEY SHOULD BE 
THE BRIGHT TRIM ON THE DRIVERS SIDE AIR VENT CREATES A GHOST REFLECTION IMAGE ON THE SIDE WINDOW THAT ALIGNS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR IMPAIRING THE SIDE VIEW THE DEGREE OF PROBLEM VARIES WITH THE STRENGTH AND ANGLE OF THE SUN 
THE BRIGHTS DO NOT SEEM AS BRIGHT IN SNOWY CONDITIONS 
THE BRIGHTS DONT SEEM TO BE BRIGHT ENOUGH 
THE BROAD RANGE OF FEATURES AND MUSIC SOURCES
THE BROAD TALL FRONT END MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO JUDGE DISTANCES BETWEEN FRONT END AND OBJECTS
THE BROWN LEATHER INTERIOR
THE BROWSE SCREEN FOR THE SATELLITE RADIO TOUCH SCREEN FINGER SCROLL UP AND DOWN IS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE 
THE BRZ HAS A VERY SMALL REAR WINDOW MAKING FOR A VERY LARGE BLIND SPOT YOU REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT S IN FRONT AND BEHIND YOU TO MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF VISABILITY ON THE REAR LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES 
THE BSM S ARE AN EXCELLENT ADDITION
THE BUILD QUALITY OF THE CAR IS EXCEPTIONAL AND CONVEYS A FEELING OF SAFETY 
THE BUILT IN BLUETOOTH THAT ALLOW ME TO COMUNICATE WHILE DRIVING NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT DISTRACTION FROM USE OF THE CELL PHONE 
THE BUILT IN IPHONE WIRE ATTACHMENT/CHARGER/CONNECTION WAS FRAYED AFTER ONE MONTH 
THE BUILT IN MIC WHEN USING HANDS FREE

THE BUILT IN PHONE ACCESS
THE BUILT IN PHONE SYSTEM AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM DON T WORK WELL AND ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO USE I MUCH PREFER JUST LINKING MY IPHONE USING BLUETOOTH AND THEN USING MY PHONE FOR EVERYTHING 
THE BUILT IN REAR ENTERTAINMENT THE SCREENS SHOULD BE MOUNTED IN THE HEAD RESTS THEY ARE TOO LOW AND TOO EASILY ACCESSIBLE BY A CHILD S FOOT WHICH COULD HARM THE SCREEN 
THE BUILT IN SOFTWARE SHOULD DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF IMPORTING/RECOGNIZING MUSIC ON A USB FLASH DRIVE THE PHONE SHOULD PAIR MUCH QUICKER THAN IT DOES 
THE BUILT IN VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT RECOGNIZE MY ACCENT AND DOES NOT WORK FOR ME 
THE BUILT IN VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED 
THE BURMEISTER I BOUGHT EVEN THOUGH IT COST WAY TOO MUCH!
THE BURMEISTER SOUND SYSTEM IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST SOUND SYSTEM I HAVE EVER HAD IN A VEHICLE
THE BUTTON FOR THE STATION CHANGE/ADVANCE FEATURE IS TOO SMALL! REALLY ANNOYING 
THE BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO CHANGE SONGS/PRESET STATIONS MOVES TO EASILY AND IS SOMETIMES ACCIDENTALLY PUSHED WHILE STEERING THE AUTOMOBILE 
THE BUTTONS ARE HARD TO TOUCH ON THE SCREEN AND THE PANEL BUTTONS SEEM LIKE THEY WILL WEAR OUT BEFORE THE CAR IS EVEN THAT OLD
THE BUTTONS ARE THE WHEEL ARE A BIT SMALL AND STIFF ALSO VOLUME KNOB IS NOT PLEASING TO TURN SMALL AND SHORT I PREFER A BIT LARGER AND ALMOST FLAT INSTEAD OF GRIPING WITH THUMB AND FORE FINGER YOU CAN SIMPLY USE A FINGER ALSO RADIO AND CONT 
THE BUTTONS AROUND THE SCREEN SEEM TO LOOK LIKE THEY WERE CUT OFF BUTTONS LOOK LIKE A SQUARE IS AROUND THEM BUT YOU ONLY SEE 3 SIDES OF THE SQUARE IT LOOKS OUT OF SORTS 
THE BUTTONS BELOW THE TOUCH SCREEN THAT CONTROL THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM ARE DIFFICULT TO PUSH SOMETIMES YOU CANNOT FIND THE RIGHT TOUCH LOCATION 
THE BUTTONS COULD HAVE A MORE DEFINED HEIGHT AND READABILITY
THE BUTTONS FOR RADIO PRESETS COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER SOMETIMES I HAVE TO TOUCH IT MORE THAN ONCE
THE BUTTONS FOR THE RADIO ARE WAY TO HIGH AND HARD TO REACH WHILE DRIVING
THE BUTTONS ON THE DASHBOARD TO TURN THE AUDIO ON AND OFF TO TURN THE TEMPERATURE UP AND DOWN IE ALL THE CLIMATE CONTROLS ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO PUSH
THE BUTTONS ON THE ENTERTAINMENT UNIT NOT STEERING WHEEL REQUIRE TOO MUCH REVIEW AND VISUAL ATTENTION TO EASILY OPERATE UNIT LARGER AND MORE LIT UP WOULD BE HELPFUL 
THE BUTTONS ON THE RADIO CANT TELL IF IT IS GOING TO CHANGE THE STATION OR CALL A PHONE NUMBER 
THE BUTTONS ON THE SIDE OF THE TOUCH SCREEN ARE OFTEN HARD TO DISTINGUISH WHERE EXACTLY TO PUSH AND SOMETIMES DON T RECEIVE MY INPUT THE SEEK BUTTONS ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TOUCH SCREEN SPECIFICALLY
THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE VERY CONVENIENT! SOME OF THE MENUS/CONTROLS TOOK A LITTLE WHILE TO GET USED TO BUT NOW I LOVE IT!
THE C PILLAR IS MUCH TOO LARGE FOR SUCH A SMALL VEHICLE THAT COMBINED WITH A SMALLISH BACK WINDOW MAKES BACKING UP AND LANE CHANGING A BIT OF A CHALLENGE 
THE CAB REAR VIEW MIRROR IS HARD TO SEE WITH A CAP INSTALLED OVER THE TRUCK BOX BUT THIS WAS EXPECTED THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS MAKE UP FOR THIS THE SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD HAVE THE SMALL WIDE VIEW BUTTON MIRRORS I INSTALLED MY OWN 
THE CABIN IS QUITE NOISY WHEN DRIVING ABOVE 30 AND IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ENJOY MUSIC WITH SO MUCH AMBIENT NOISE

THE CAMERAS ARE VERY HARD TO LEARN TO USE THE SIDE CAMERA IS VERY DISAPPOINTING BY THE TIME THE IMAGE APPEARS IT S TOO LATE BUT I LOVE IT FOR PARALLEL PARKING I DON T LIKE THE VISIBILITY OF THE FIT DIDN T REALIZE IT WHEN I TEST DROVE IT TOO 
THE CAMERAS UNDER THE SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD BE ANGLED AND SHOW LITTLE BEYOND MIRROR S VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE CAMPER MIRRORS ALTHOUGH A NECESSITY BECAUSE I TOW A 5TH WHEEL ALMOST ENTIRELY BLOCK MY SIDE VISION WHEN MAKING TURNS THE MIRROR HOUSING NEEDS VERTICAL ADJUSTMENT CONTROLS/PROVISIONS 
THE CAMPER MIRRORS HAVING THE CONVEX LOWER LENS HELPS WITH VEHICLES THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE IN A BLIND SPOT I LIKE THE OVERALL LARGER CAMPER MIRRORS FOR VISIBILITY 
THE CAMRY HAD GREAT A GREAT VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS 
THE CAPABILITY TO CONTROL ALMOST EVERYTHING WITH AN EXCELLENT AUDIO SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING 
THE CAR APPEARS TO BE WELL BUILT AND VERY EASY TO DRIVE BOTH AT SLOW SPEEDS RWS AND AT HIGH SPEEDS WITH AWS BOTH INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR STYLING IS EXCELLENT AND I M SURE I LL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE PORSCHES 
THE CAR APPEARS TO HAVE AN OBSTRUCTED VIEW WHEN CHANGING LANES AND THE FROM DRIVER SIDE ROOF SUPPORT IS OBSTRUCTIVE WHEN MAKING TURNS HOWEVER ONE CAN ACCLIMATE 
THE CAR BODY S NOISE INSULATION IS BETTER THAN AVERAGE CARS WHICH ALLOWS ME TO HAVE A MUCH BETTER AUDIO EXPERIENCE IN ALL ASPECTS 
THE CAR CAME WITH AN OLD IPOD/IPHONE ADAPTER I HAD TO SEARCH ONLINE TO FIND THE REPLACEMENT THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM FOR NON ENGLISH LANGUAGE DISPLAY IS NOT SO GOOD CHARACTER SHOWS UP IN BOXES THE AUDIO PLUG IN IS NOT INTUITIVE ALL NEEDS TO 
THE CAR CANNOT BE DRIVEN WITHOUT CONSTANT USE OF BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE MIRRORS SINCE THE SEAT SIZE BLOCKS MOST OF THE REAR VISION!

THE CAR IS SAFE TO ME 
THE CAR IS SMALL AND WHEN I CLOSE THE TRUNK IT SOUNDS A BIT TINNY NOT SO STURDY BUT I DON T THINK A HEAVIER METAL ON THE TRUNK WOULD MAKE THE CAR ANY SAFER THOUGH IT DOES MAKE ME WONDER ABOUT ITS CRUSHABILITY PERHAPS BECAUSE LARGE TRUCKS AND 
THE CAR IS SO LOW VISIBILITY IS HINDERED BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF CAR NOT BECAUSE OF ANY DESIGN FLAWS
THE CAR IS SOLID AND DRIVES EXCEPTIONAL

THE CAR STEERS AND HANDLES VERY GOOD 
THE CAR SUSPENSION FEELS LOOSE COMPARED TO C300 
THE CAR TURNED OUT TO BE TOO SMALL FOR ME I TRADED IT IN AFTER A MONTH FOR A VOLVO XC70 HAD THE VOLVO XC90 R DESIGN BEEN AVAILABLE I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT IT THE CAR FELT A LITTLE EXPOSED PERHAPS DUE TO SIZE AND I DID NOT LIKE HOW IT APPEARE 
THE CAR URGENTLY NEEDS A CENTER ARMREST IN LIEW OF THE MARGINAL INDIVIDUAL ONES INSTALLED 
THE CAR WAS GREAT IN THE SNOW WE LIVE IN THE NE AND HAD SOME WINTER ICE AND SNOW THE CAR PERFORMED WELL
THE CAR WAS SOLD TO ME WITH SATELLITE RADIO AND IT WAS NOT ON THE VEHICLE AND HAD TO BE ADDED LATER THE RECEIVER IS NOW IN WHAT USED TO BE MY ASHTRAY VERY DISAPPOINTING FOR A CAR IN THIS PRICE RANGE!
THE CAR WAS TINTED PER MY REQUEST FOR TOO MUCH MONEY BY THE DEALER AND THEY DID NOT TINT THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD IT MAKES IT HARD TO DRIVE BY HAVING THE VISORS DOWN WITHOUT THE TINTING WHERE IT WAS NEEDED THIS WAS AFTERMARKET I M SURE FA 
THE CAR WASN T REALLY DESIGNED FOR A LOT OF OPTIONS I COULD SEE THAT RIGHT AWAY A FEW MORE THINGS LIKE READING AND COMPOSING TEXT MESSAGES WOULD BE NICE I USE THAT A LOT IN MY OTHER CAR 
THE CAR WE SELECTED HAD AN $850 AUDIO UPGRADE THAT WE DIDN T NEED IT WAS THE PRICE WE PAID TO GET THE COLOR WE WANTED 
THE CAR WILL ONLY RECOGNIZE ONE PHONE!
THE CAR WON T LET YOU ENTER AN ADDRESS NOT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION I UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY ASPECT OF THIS FEATURE BUT MOST OF THE TIME IT IS A PASSENGER ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE ADDRESS THE DRIVER SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIB 
THE CARS SHOULD COME EQUIPPED WITH A BACK UP CAMERA REAR VISIBILITY WHILE BACKING UP IS POOR 
THE CD PLAYER CANNOT BE UTILIZES WHILE DRIVING 
THE CD PLAYER IS BARE BONES IT COULD AT LEAST USE A REPLAY FEATURE 
THE CD PLAYER SHOULD BE ON THE DASHBOARD NOT IN THE GLOVE BOX!!!
THE CD PLAYER SKIPS JUMBLES TRACKS TO A SONG WHEN I HIT POTHOLES 
THE CD SHOULD BEGIN WHERE IT LEFT OFF AND NOT BEGIN THE TRACT AGAIN AND THEY NEED TO INSTALL A 6 CD PLAYER OR AT THE VERY LEAST MAKE IT AN OPTION FOR THOSE OF US THAT WANT IT 
THE CEILING SIDE A LITTLE LOW FOR VISIBILITY 
THE CELL PHONE ADAPTATION NEEDS TO BE REVISED TO ACCEPT THE PHONE BOOKS OF ALL PHONES AS WELL AS THEIR CALL HISTORY THE SYSTEM SHOULD ALSO INCORPORATE THE ABILITY TO SEND AND RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGE VIA THE HANDS FREE SYSTEM 
THE CELL PHONE BLUE TOOTH AUDIO IS VERY GOOD TO OUTSTANDING FOR EASE OF USE AND FIDELITY THE NAV IS EASY TO USE AND DISPLAY IS EXCELLENT HOWEVER MAPS ARE NOT 100% UP TO DATE AND NOT JUST MISSING NEWLY BUILT RAODS BUT LONG ESTABLISHED ADDRESSES 
THE CELL PHONE INTERFACE WHEN CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM
THE CELL PHONE PAIRING/SYNCING IS NOT VERY GOOD FOR PLAYING MUSIC
THE CELL PHONE/VOICE SYSTEM RARELY WORKS
THE CENTER BACK SEAT HEADREST IS TO HIGH IT PARTIALLY BLOCKS THE VIEW AND I AM 5 FT 8 INCHES SO I AM NOT A SHORT PERSON 
THE CENTER CONSOLE AND STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS ARE VERY INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE PLUS THE CENTER CONSOLE LOOKS SO COOL
THE CENTER CONSOLE TURNING KNOB MAKES MANEUVERING SIMPLE 
THE CENTER DISPLAY THE DATA DISPLAY NEEDS DIMMING CAPABILITY AT NIGHT THE DISPLAY OF OUTDOOR TEMPERATURE MILES REMAINING BEFORE EMPTY AVERAGE MPG AND INSTANTANEOUS MPG IS SO BRIGHT THAT READING THE CRITICAL INSTRUMENTS ENGINE COOLANT TEMPE 
THE CENTER REAR VIEW MIRROR ISN T BIG ENOUGH 
THE CENTER SCREEN WHILE IN THE RADIO MODE COULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED FOR EXAMPLE SHOW THE ARTIST S NAMES AND NAME OF THE SONG BIGGER SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY READ IT EASLY
THE CENTER TOUCH DISPLAY PATTERN 
THE CENTERPOINT SYSTEM
THE CHALLENGER HAS MANY SAFETY FEATURES WHICH DOES MAKE ME FEEL SAFE WHEN I AM DRIVING THE ONLY THING BAD IS THAT ONE BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE THE ADDED FEATURE IN THE MIRROR THAT LIGHTS UP IS A HUGE HELP 
THE CHALLENGER HAS PRETTY BIG BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES DEPENDING ON THE SEAT LOCATION OF THE PASSENGER SEAT THE SMALL SIDE WINDOW MAY BE BLOCKED CREATING A LARGE BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE 
THE CHANGE LANE ASSISTANCE SYSTEM IS NOT USEFUL AT ALL I COULDN T TRUST AND DEPEND ON IT WHEN I NEED TO CHANGE A LANE SO THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY BOTHER ME TO CONCENTRATE ON CHANGING THE LANE I THINK IT IS VERY DANGER FOR EVERY DRIVER 
THE CHANNEL CHANGE/SOURCE SELECT BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL WILL CHANGE SOURCES INSTEAD OF CHANNELS SOMETIMES DUE TO MY HAVING BIG THUMBS THAT PUSH IN MORE THAN PUSH UP 
THE CHANNEL SELECTION TOUCH SCREEN IS TERRIBLE WHENEVER I TOUCH A BOX RECTANGLE REPRESENTING A RADIO STATION THE SCROLL BAR IS OFTEN ACTIVATED INSTEAD AND THE SCREEN GOES OFF TO A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF PRESETS THIS IS BOTH ANNOYING AND DISTR 
THE CHARGING PAD HAS NEVER WORKED AND COMPATIBILITY ISSUES WITH PANDORA ARE CONFUSING
THE CHEVY MYLNK SYSTEM IS A LITTLE BUGGY WHEN USING MY IPOD ESPECIALLY THE DASHBOARD INTERFACE USING THE STEERING WHEEL
THE CHIP IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE CAR SO I DON T KNOW ABOUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE CHOICES OF MEDIA IT AFFORDS 
THE CHORD FOR CONNECTING I PHONE 6 IS TOO SHORT ALSO WHEN PLUGGING INTO CIGARETTE LIGHTER OUTLET FOR POWER ONE CANNOT CLOSE THE STORAGE COMPARTMENT WHICH MAKES DRIVING UNCOMFORTABLE 
THE CHROME RINGS AROUND THE DASH VENTS CAN REFLECT THE SUN INTO THE DRIVERS EYES
THE CITY MAP IS VERY ACCURATE THE NAVIGATION ALLOWS ME TO GET TO MY APPOINTMENTS ON TIME I M VERY PLEASED WITH THE CAR 
THE CLARITY AND EASE OF USE 
THE CLARITY AND EASE OF USE IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE CLARITY AND EASE OF USING IT TRULY APPRECIATE THE TIME THE SALES ASSOCIATES TOOK TO EXPLAIN ALL OF THE FEATURES OF MY AUDIO SYSTEM 
THE CLARITY IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE CLARITY OF IT & EASE OF USE
THE CLARITY OF PHONE CALLS
THE CLARITY OF PHONE CALLS COULD BE BETTER 
THE CLARITY OF SOUND AND EASE OF THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION 
THE CLARITY OF SOUND FOR BOTH AUDIO AND PHONE 
THE CLARITY OF SOUND WHEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ON THE PHONE 
THE CLARITY OF THE 550 WATT SOUND SYSTEM IS AMAZING 
THE CLARITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM 
THE CLARITY OF THE PHONE CALLS
THE CLARITY OF THE PHONE COMMUNICATIONS CALLERS HARDLY KNOW THAT I AM NOT HOLDING MY PHONE UP TO MY EAR 
THE CLARITY OF THE SOUND
THE CLARITY OF THE SOUND IS AWESOME 
THE CLARITY OF THE SOUND IS EXCEPTIONAL WHETHER IT BE MUSIC OR PHONE CALLS 
THE CLARITY OF THE SPEAKERS WITH BOTH FM RADIO AND TELEPHONE USE 
THE CLARITY OF THE SYSTEM FINDING THE CORRECT NAMES
THE CLARITY WHEN USING HANDS FREEE CALLING COUDL BE BETTER BUT IS MUCH IMPROVED OVER PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS SYNC IS MUCH IMPROVED I D SAY OUTSTANDING THE RADIO POPS ON WHEN ANSWERING A CALL WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING TO CLARIFY IT MUTES WHEN RINGING 
THE CLEAN AGGRESSIVE STYLING OF EVERYTHING THE SCREEN BUTTONS KNOBS AND FEEL ARE GREAT!
THE CLEAR AND CONCISENESS OF THE SCREEN SELECTIONS
THE CLEAR AND CRISP SOUND OF THE SYSTEM
THE CLEAR AND SIMPLICITY OF THEM
THE CLEAR SOUND
THE CLOCK
THE CLOCK AND TEMPERATURE READ OUT SHOULD BE LARGER HARD TO READ THE CLOCK
THE CLOCK DOES NOT COME ONE WHEN THE CAR IS OFF I FIND THAT WHOLE SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH 
THE CLOCKS SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE TO DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME! THE MANUAL SAID THEY AUTOMATICALLY UPDATE BUT IN FACT THEY DON T! I SPOKE WITH THE DEALER AND HE CONFIRMED THEY DON T THAT PEOPLE BRING THEIR CARS IN TO HAVE THE CLOCKS MOVED AHE 
THE CLUMSY NOT INTUITIVE LAYERING OF THE SYSTEM THE USE OF STILTED LANGUAGE TO CALL UP FRREQUENTLY USED FUNCTIONS LIKE CALL BARB USE OF IPHONE ADDRESS BOOK FOR NAVIGATION CALLING UP STORED LOCATIONS CHANGING THE CITY AS A DEFAULT SWITCHING 
THE CLUSTER PANEL CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE SOMETIMES DUE TO GLARE
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE DETECTOR IS WORTHLESS 
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURE IS OUTSTANDING !!! THIS IS A WELL DESIGNED SYSTEM AND DEFINITELY REDUCES THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCIDENTS 
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURES ARE VERY GOOD 
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IS FANTASTIC!
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM SHOULD REALLY BE INCLUDED ON THE EXL TRIM LEVEL
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM SOMETIMES ACTIVATES WHEN APPROACHING AN OVERPASS 
THE COLLISION BRAKING SYSTEM HAS ALREADY PREVENTED AN ACCIDENT 
THE COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM REAR CAMERA LANE CHANGING ALERT AND BLIND SPOT ALERT ARE ALL FANTASTIC FEATURES THAT MAKE THE VEHICLE OUTSTANDING 
THE COLOR CODING FOR TRAFFIC CONDITIONS IS CONFUSING AND SHOULD BE IMPROVED 
THE COLOR DISPLAY AND IMPROVED LAYOUT FOR DISPLAYING IPOD INFORMATION IS FAR SUPERIOR TO MY PREVIOUS 2012 FRONTIER 
THE COLOR HEADS UP DISPLAY IS A GREAT FEATURE THAT HELPS KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD 
THE COLOR OF THE LIGHTING USED RED IS NOT A VERY NICE COLOR ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT BACK TO SOFT WHITE WOULD BE NICE
THE COLOR OF THE WARNING LIGHTS FOR THE BLINDSPOT NOTIFICATION IS HARD TO SEE IN THE DAYTIME 
THE COLOR RED IS NOT APPEALING THE CAR DOES NOT SUPPORT MY PHONE AS A MEDIA TO PLAY MUSIC AND THE RADIO HAS A LOT MORE INTERFERENCE THAN MY OLD CAR 2002 NISSAN SENTRA DID 
THE COLOR THE VISIBILITY IT IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN 2012 NAV ON BMX X5D
THE COLORADO HAS A HIGH RIDE HEIGHT WHICH I LIKE HAVING ESPECIALLY WITH A MIDSIZE TRUCK 
THE COLORS COULD BE IMPROVED MY GARMIN HAD MORE COLORS ON THE SCREEN SO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE ROGUE IS A LITTLE BLAND COMPARED TO THE GARMIN 
THE COLUMN BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOOR SEEMS A LITTLE OUT OF PLACE AND TOOK SOME TIME TO ADJUST TO WHERE TO LOOK WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE COLUMN ON THE BACK PASSENGER SIDE IS REALLY BAD IN MY OPINION IT S VERY EASY TO MISS A CAR EVEN WHEN TURNING TO THE RIGHT BEFORE YOU TURN 
THE COMANDS
THE COMMAND CENTER DIAL IN THE CENTER CONSOLE I USE IT CONSTANTLY AND IT KEEPS MY HANDS OFF THE TOUCH SCREEN EASY TO USE
THE COMMAND CENTER ON THE CONSOLE IS REDUNDANT AND UNNECESSARY 
THE COMMAND OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION ARE TOO LONG AND HAS POOR VOICE RECOGNITION 
THE COMMAND SYSTEM IS VERY COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT TO USE I STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO USE VOICE COMMANDS I D LOVE TO KNOW!
THE COMMAND TO SHUFFLE SONGS ON THE CONNECTED IPOD IS OFTEN IGNORED AND REQUIRES 2 OR 3 ATTEMPTS BEFORE IT IS HEEDED 
THE COMMAND WHEEL AT THE FRONT OF THE CENTER CONSOLE / ARMREST THE WHEEL IS VERY EASY TO USE AND CAN CONTROL THE SYSTEMS EASILY WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AWAY FROM THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING 
THE COMMENTS MADE IN PREVIOUS Q&A
THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ME AND THE SYSTEM IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY ABOUT 70% OF THE TIME 
THE COMMUNICATION IS CLEAR 
THE COMMUNICATION IS NEVER COMPLETELY CLEAR TO THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE 
THE COMMUNICATION JUST LAGS AND DOESN T UNDERSTAND WHAT I TRY TO SAY 
THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM HAS NO PROBLEMS CONNECTING AND THE CLARITY IS SUPERB!
THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND PAIRS DEVICES QUICKLY AND EASILY 
THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS THE STANDOUT THE BLUETOOTH HANDS FREE CONNECTIVITY IS GREAT AND WORKS SEAMLESSLY ONCE THE PHONE IS CONNECTED 
THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IT IS HANDS FREE 
THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM PAIRS WITH MY SMART PHONE
THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS IN THIS CAR ARE EXCELLENT AND EASY TO USE 
THE COMPASS IS TERRIBLE I LITERALLY CANNOT TELL WHAT DIRECTION I AM GOING THERE ARE TOO MANY LAYERS TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OFTEN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE CAR CANNOT FIND THE ADDRESS THEN I PUT THE SAME ADDRESS IN GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE 
THE COMPLEX MENU SYSTEM NEEDS VAST IMPROVEMENT BASED ON USER INPUT NEARLY EVERY DRIVER OF A LATE MODEL CAR CAN EASILY SEE WAYS TO IMPROVE THIS DRIVER/VEHICLE INTERFACE THE PERPLEXING QUESTION IS WHY THE SOFTWARE ENGINEERS DON T LISTEN TO THE US 
THE COMPLEXITY OF THE VARIOUS CONTROL SYSTEMS CAN MAKE IT VERY DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING YOU ALMOST NEED A CO PILOT ALSO I VE HAD A COUPLE INSTANCES WHERE THE EMERGENCY BRAKING STARTS NOT SEVERELY BUT JUST ACTIVATES BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN 
THE COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM
THE COMPUTER CONSOLE CONSTANTLY CHANGES SCREENS WITHOUT PROMPTING 
THE COMPUTER PROCESSOR DOESN T SEEM TO BE FAST ENOUGH WHEN INPUTTING ADDRESSES
THE CONDENSATION IN THE HEADLIGHTS IN WINTER IS BAD 
THE CONNECTED FEATURE ONLY WORKS IF YOU HAVE AN IPHONE I HAVE AN ANDROID THE HANDS FREE VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK AT ALL IT IS USELESS I HAVE TRIED EVERY COMMAND AND IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANYTHING THAT I OR ANYONE ELSE IN MY FAM 
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MY SMART PHONE AND THE CAR HAS BEEN LOST SEVERAL TIMES I GET A CALL OR TEXT ON MY PHONE AND IT DOES NOT SHOW OR COME THROUGH ON MY CAR THEREFORE I HAVE MISSED CALLS AND TEXTS WHILE DRIVING PLEASE CORRECT THAT 
THE CONNECTION FOR THE IPOD IS NOT FIRST CLASS IT IS FUNKY CANNOT JUST DO A STRAIGHT CONNECTION THIS IS NOT AUDI QUALITY 
THE CONNECTION OF THE USB CORDS IT IS SMALL AND HARD TO GET FINGERS IN FOR ATTACHMENT
THE CONNECTION PROCESS TO THE BLUETOOTH IS THE PROBABLY THE WORST PROBLEM AND THE VOLUME REALLY DIFFERS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF LISTENING TO MUSIC FROM FM TO PHONE 
THE CONNECTION SPEED WHEN CONNECTED TO THE PHONE IT CAN BE SLOW TO READ AND PLAY STORED MUSIC 
THE CONNECTION TIME TO CONNECT TO THE CELL PHONE IS TOO LONG WHEN LISTENING TO AUDIO FROM THE PHONE CONNECTION THEN STOPPING THE CAR AFTER COMING BACK THE AUDIO REVERTS BACK TO THE RADIO AND NOT THE LAST PLACE IT WAS GETTING AUDIO FROM THIS IS 
THE CONNECTION TO BLUETOOTH 
THE CONNECTION TO THE CAR S AUX IS QUITE DIFFICULT OF A BLUETOOTH POSSIBLE CONNECTION IS DETECTED IN THE CAR THE CAR WANTS TO USE THE MEDIA CORD INSTEAD OF THE AUX CORD AND THAT IS NOT ALWAYS A VIABLE OPTION AND THE DISPLAY BUTTONS DO NO 
THE CONNECTION TO THE IPHONE WAS SIMPLE AND QUICK 
THE CONNECTIVITY AND SOUND QUALITY OF PHONE CALLS IS OUTSTANDING 
THE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WITH THE BLUETOOTH HAS OCCURRED MANY TIMES FOR ME 
THE CONNECTIVITY OF A VARIETY OF TYPES OF MEDIA WAS A BIG SELLING POINT FOR ME I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THESE FEATURES KEEP ME FOCUSED ON DRIVING AND NOT TEXTING AND DIALING ON MY PHONE 
THE CONNECTIVITY OF THE BLUETOOTH IS GREAT SOUND OF MUSIC THROUGH BLUETOOTH STREAMING CONNETION IS NOT INTERFERED WITH LIKE MANY OTHER VEHICHLE BRANDS JUST LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM A RADIO STATION!
THE CONNECTIVITY OF THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL WITH MY EXTERNAL MEDIA DEVICE CONNECTED OVER BLUETOOTH KEEPS MY EYES ON THE ROAD WHILE SWITCHING BETWEEN SONGS 
THE CONNECTIVITY TO MY DEICE WORKS WELL EVEN WITH SIRI
THE CONNECTIVITY TO OLDER GENERATIONS OF SMARTPHONES IS LACKING WHICH MIGHT BE UNAVOIDABLE I HAD A SLIGHTLY DATED IPHONE WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR AND IT DIDN T COMMUNICATE WELL WITH MY CAR 
THE CONNECTIVITY TO THE IPHONE SOMETIMES DISCONNECTS AND YOU HAVE TO CHANGE SOURCES AND CHANGE IT BACK TO GET IT GOING AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO TEXT MESSAGES WITH MY VOICE AND HAVE IT RESPOND BACK ON THE PHONE 
THE CONNECTIVITY TO THE PHONE IS GREAT ONLY CHALLENGE IS SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO TURN UP THE VOLUME WHEN IT SHOUL DBE THE VOLUME ITS ALREADY AT MEANING THE RADIO WILL BE ON AT A CERTAIN VOLUME WE LL GET A CALL AND I HAVE TO TURN UP THE VOLUME IN 
THE CONNECTIVITY WITH IPHONE WORKS VERY WELL AND PICKS UP WHERE YOU LEFT OFF THE AVAILABLE FEATURES ARE GOOD TOO
THE CONNECTIVITY WITH MY IPHONE VIA BLUETOOTH WE VE COME A LONG WAY FROM AUXILIARY PORTS
THE CONSOLE LIGHT IS VERY BRIGHT WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT THERE IS A GLARE ON THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE WINDOWS THIS MAKES TURNING MORE DIFFICULT IF THE WINDOWS ARE UP 
THE CONTOURS ON THE FRONT HOOD WILL AT TIMES REFLECT BLINDING SUNLIGHT BACK AT THE DRIVER TO ME THIS IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW IF YOU NOTICE OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD ALMOST NONE OF THEM HAVE CONTOURING OF THE HOOD WITH PARALLEL CONTOURING T 
THE CONTROL ARE NATURAL AND EXTREMELY EASY TO USE 
THE CONTROL ARE VERY POORLY DESIGNED THE BUTTONS ARE TOO SMALL AND THE DISPLAY IS GENERIC/LIKE OLD CRT COMPUTER TERMINAL THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE BLUE TOOTH CALLS ARE VERY POOR
THE CONTROL BUTTON IS VERY CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT TO USE ACCURATELY THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE NOT CONSISTENT IN THEIR OPERATION DOING MUCH WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY TO CHANGE CHANNELS WITH VOICE COMMANDS IS NEXT TO 
THE CONTROL BUTTONS ARE TOO CLOSE TO THE CLOCK SO SOMETIMES I HIT THE CLOCK BUTTON WITHOUT REALIZING IT
THE CONTROL DIAL FOR CHANGING STATIONS IS TOO SENSITIVE TUNING KNOB OFTEN CAUSING ME TO GO SEVERAL STATIONS WHEN I WANT TO JUST GO ONE 
THE CONTROL IS NOT AS INTUITIVE AS THOSE FOUND IN LEXUS/INFINITI 
THE CONTROL IS TOO EASILY BUMPED DUE TO IT S LOCATION NEAR THE CUP HOLDER 
THE CONTROL KNOB
THE CONTROL KNOB IN THE CENTER ARM REST SHOULD HAVE A HEATER IN IT IT IS VERY COLD IN THE WINTER
THE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASIER TO HANDLE AND ALL FEATURES SHOULD BE MORE CLEAR 
THE CONTROL STICK ON THE CONSOLE NEED TO BE GONE!!!!!!
THE CONTROL WHEEL USER INTERFACE IS THE BEST 
THE CONTROLS ARE A BIT ARCANE AND REQUIRE SOME STUDY TO MASTER I NEVER TAKE THE TIME TO LEARN THEM AND AM CONSTANTLY EXPERIMENTING WITH THEM 
THE CONTROLS ARE CONFUSING 
THE CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT TO REACH ON THE MIDDLE COUNSEL FOR THE AUDIO LIKE IT BETTER ON THE DASH 
THE CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE I DON T LIKE HAVING TO TURN AN KNOW TO REACH AN ARTIST ON MY IPOD I WOULD PREFER SPEAKING THE ARTISTS NAME OR CHOOSING A LETTER TO QUICKLY SELECT A CATEGORY I ALSO DON T LIKE THE COLORS AND THE LOOK OF THE RADI 
THE CONTROLS ARE EASY TO USE AND HELPFUL 
THE CONTROLS ARE EASY TO USE AND STYLISH 
THE CONTROLS ARE FAR AWAY FROM THE DRIVER I AM 6 AND HAVE TO LEAN OVER TO CHANGE THE STATIONS I HAVEN T QUITE GOT DOWN THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO DO WHAT I WANT THEM TO 
THE CONTROLS ARE NOT EXACTLY THE SAME FOR THE 2014 BMW X5 AND THE 2015 228 MAKING IT CONFUSING AT TIME TO FIND THINGS 
THE CONTROLS ARE NOT INTUITIVE FOR SEARCHING SAVING ADDRESSES AND NAVIGATING THE DUAL DISPLAY IS OFTEN CONFUSING 
THE CONTROLS ARE OVERLY COMLEX
THE CONTROLS ARE RIGHT AT MY FINGER TIPS DISPLAY IS EASY TO READ THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT 
THE CONTROLS ARE SMALL AND HARD TO USE 
THE CONTROLS ARE SO EASY TO USE THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO LOOK AWAY FROM THE ROAD NOW THAT I AM ACCUSTOMED TO THEM 
THE CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE MY 2006 WAS MUCH EASIER TO USE REAR AUDIO ALWAYS DEFAULTS BACK TO OFF 
THE CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE SOUND IS AVERAGE 
THE CONTROLS ARE TOO CLOSE AND VERY SIMILAR TO THE HEATING/COOLING CONTROLS MAYBE A LITTLE MORE SEPARATION AND A LITTLE HIGHER SO THERE IS VERY DISTRACTION FROM DRIVING 
THE CONTROLS ARE TOO COMPLICATED THEY TAKE TOO MUCH OF THE DRIVERS ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE ROAD TO BE ABLE TO USE WHEN THE CAR IS MOVING THE KISS PRINCIPALS SHOULD BE APPLIED 
THE CONTROLS ARE VERY INTUITIVE AND EFFICIENT ONCE YOU GET USED TO THE BUTTON AND TOUCH SCREEN LAYOUTS 
THE CONTROLS ARE VERY INTUITIVE AND WERE EASY TO LEARN 
THE CONTROLS ARE VERY SIMPLE I DIDN T HAVE TO READ THE HANDBOOK FROM START TO FINISH TO BE ABLE TO USE THE NAVIGATION OR BLUETOOTH
THE CONTROLS ARE VERY SMALL HOWEVER I DON T KNOW HOW THEY COULD BE IMPROVED DUE TO SPACE IN THE VEHICLE I LIKE HE LARGE DISPLAY FOR THE NAVI SYSTEM 
THE CONTROLS CAN BE CONFUSING TO OPERATE MULTIPLE STEPS ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE A SELECTION A SIMPLE STATION CHANGE REQUIRES THREE STEPS 1 TURN DIAL 2 WAIT FOR THE DELAY FOR THE SYSTEM TO CATCH UP 3 PUSH OUTER RING OF RING OF SELECTIO 
THE CONTROLS COULD BE MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY TOO MANY OPTIONS ON EACH CONTROL NOT CLEARLY MARKED HARD TO REMEMBER WHICH DIAL TO GO TO NEXT WHEN YOU NEED TO CHANGE SOMETHING VERY FRUSTRATING 
THE CONTROLS FOR ADJUSTING BASS TREBLE ETC ARE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO USE 
THE CONTROLS FOR PLAYING MUSIC ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND SWITCHING BETWEEN SATELLITE AND FM RADIO IS CONFUSING 
THE CONTROLS FOR THE AUDIO AND NAVIGATION ARE WONDERFUL IN WHAT THEY CAN DO BUT IT IS A LOT TO REMEMBER WHILE DRIVING
THE CONTROLS FOR THE BACK DEFROSTER AND WIPER/WASHER IS NOT CONVENIENTLY LOCATED
THE CONTROLS FOR THE IPOD ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL CORRECTLY THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO CONTROL THE SELECTION IS DAUNTING WHEN TRYING TO SELECT FORWARD OR BACK FOR THE CD THE TOGGLE SWITCH IS EASILY DEPRESSED WHICH CHANGES THE AUDIO SO 
THE CONTROLS FOR VOLUME AND OTHER CHANGES WHICH USE YOUR FINGER TO SLIDE THE CONTROLS IS EXTREMELY POOR AND DIFFICULT TO FUNCTION PROPERLY PLEASE USE TRADITIONAL CONTROLS THAT ARE MORE POSITIVE AND HAVE BETTER FEEL 
THE CONTROLS GET MOVED WHEN I FORGET AND SET MY PURSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CONSOLE LIKE IT BUT NEED PLACE TO SET & LOOK THROUGH PURSE LIKE FOR GLASSES BRIDGE PASS IT REALLY IS NO BIGGIE BUT I KEEP CHANGING MY RADIO TO TELEPHONE TYPE THING WIT 
THE CONTROLS ON THE DASHBOARD
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING COLUMN ARE EASY TO USE AND THE VOICE CONTROL IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU CAN T TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL 
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING COLUMN MAKE FOR A SAFER AND MORE ERGONOMIC EXPERIENCE 
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL 
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND EASE OF USING THE FLASH DRIVE FOR SONGS 
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE BACKWARDS FROM THE 2012 PATHFINDER THE PATHFINDER ARRANGEMENT IS BETTER 
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE SORT OF CONFUSING PRESSING THE UP ARROW BUTTON CHANGES THE RADIO STATION THE NEXT HIGHEST PRESET # IE FROM PRESET 2 TO PRESET 3 HOWEVER ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IT SHOWS THE PRESET BUTTONS STARTING WITH 1 A 
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE TOO EASY TO BUMP I HAVE CHANGED THE STATION ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION SIMPLY TURNING THE WHEEL
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE VERY SENSITIVE THE SLEEVE OF MY COAT HAS CHANGED THE RADIO STATION MANY TIMES 
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL FOR RADIO COULD BE EASIER TO USE DIFFERENT TYPE OF CONTROLS 
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL MAKE SKIPPING/PAUSING/ECT SONGS ON MY BLUETOOTH CONNECTED PHONE REALLY EASY 
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL MAKES IT EASIER TO TAKE AND MAKE PHONE CALLS AND CHANGE MUSIC STATIONS OR FORMAT WITHOUT DISTRACTING ME FROM THE ROAD 
THE CONTROLS OVERALL ARE QUITE INTUITIVE WE LIKE IT 
THE CONTROLS TO ADJUST SPEAKER SETTINGS ARE LESS INTUITIVE THAN OTHER STEREO SYSTEMS I VE USED IN OTHER VEHICLES 
THE CONTROLS WERE EASIER TO ACCESS IN THE G37X THE CONTROLS ARE NOT THAT EASY TO FIND WITH THE Q50
THE CONTROLS WHEN MEDIA DEVICES ARE CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH AUDIO HAVE A LONG DELAY THIS WILL SOMETIMES RESULT IN EITHER SKIPPING THE DESIRED SONG PRESSING MULTIPLE TIMES OR REWINDING TO THE BEGINNING OF A SONG WHEN I INTENDED TO GO BACK ONE 
THE CONVENIENCE OF BEING ABLE TO DRIVE WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK AT TELEPHONE JUST TOUCH ONE BUTTON TO ANSWER PHONE 
THE CONVENIENCE OF IT ALL TO BE ABLE TO USE IT WITH A MINIMUM OF DISTRACTION WHILE DRIVING ONCE YOU HAVE PRACTICED AND LEARNED HOW TO USE IT TO YOUR ADVANTAGE 
THE CONVENIENT CONTROLS AND THE CLARITY OF THE SOUND 
THE CONVERTIBLE TOP STILL MAKES IT A LITTLE TOO NOISY TO TALK ON THE PHONE I CAN CONNECT MY PHONE OR IPOD BUT I HAVE TO CONTROL IT THROUGH MY PHONE I CAN T USE THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO LOOK AT MY PHONE/IPOD WHILE DRIVING
THE CONVEX MIRROR IS TO SMALL AND NOT HAVING A PASSENGER SIDE ONE IS RIDICULOUS
THE CORNER SUPPORT POSTS THAT FRAME THE WINDSHIELD ARE WIDE AND BLOCK A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE VIEW ESPECIALLY WHEN TURNING CORNERS 
THE COST OF SATELLITE WIFI ECT IF YOU WANT IT ALL IS AS BAD AS ANOTHER CAR PAYMENT
THE COST OF THE SIRIUS RADIO AFTER FREE PERIOD NOT VERY ECONOMICAL
THE COUNSEL CONTROLS ARE VERY TOUCHY EASY TO CHANGE SOMETHING BY JUST ALIGHT TOUCH
THE COVERAGE OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE IS UNUSUALLY GREAT 
THE CRASH TEST RESULTS ARE APPALLING FOR A VEHICLE THAT IS DESIGNED FOR FAMILIES THE SMALL OFFSET CRASH TEST MAKES ME SICK IF WE DIDN T LOVE OUR PREVIOUS QUEST VAN SO MUCH I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ANOTHER MAKE SIMPLY FOR THIS ISSUE ALONE 
THE CT S FRONT VISIBILITY IS COMPROMISED BY THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I FEEL IT IS TOO BIG AND TOO LOW ALSO LOOKING BACK THROUGH THE REAR WINDOWS WHILE BACKING UP IS PRETTY MUCH POINTLESS I RELY ON THE REAR VIEW CAMERAS 100% OF THE TIME 
THE CUE IS HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING THE INTERFACE IS A LITTLE TOO INVOLVED TO FOCUS ON WHEN DRIVING SAFELY IMPLEMENTING ALTERNATE OPTIONS SUCH AS APPLE CARPLAY OR ANDROID AUTO MIGHT BE A GREAT WAY TO GO 
THE CUE SCREEN SLIDE BAR FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK THE BEST OR I AM NOT USING IT PROPERLY 
THE CUE SYSTEM HAS AN ELEGANT DESIGN THE DISPLAY IS WELL DONE AND EASY TO USE I LOVE THAT YOU GET THE FULL SCREEN WHEN NOT ACTUALLY PUNCHING BUTTONS!
THE CUE SYSTEM IS MUCH TOO COMPLICATED AND IS GOING TO CAUSE DISTRACTED DRIVER ACCIDENTS 
THE CUE SYSTEM IS NOT EASY TO USE 
THE CUE SYSTEM TAKES A LONG WHILE TO GET USED TO YOU SHOULD TRAIN YOURSELF WELL ON USING IT BEFORE YOU DRIVE IT MAKES YOU TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF THE ROAD FOR TOO LONG LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT SCREEN/BUTTONS BUT THE DISPLAY IS GREAT THE VOICE REC 
THE CURRENT DISPLAY IS HORRIBLE THE CAR SHOULD HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN OR AT LEAST A MULTI COLORED LCD 
THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO ESTABLISH A NEW DESTINATION IS VERY TIME CONSUMING AND REQUIRES THE USE OF THE ONBOARD CURSER SYSTEM INSTEAD OF EITHER VOICE OR TOUCH SCREEN 
THE CURVE OF THE WINDSHIELD MAKES THE DRIVER SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER COVER LESS AREA AND LEAVES A GAP ALONG THE LEFT EDGE ALSO THE WASHER SPRAY IS INEFFECTIVE WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION BECAUSE THE AERODYNAMICS SENDS THE FLUID TOWARD THE ROOF 
THE CUT OUT AREA ON THE SIDE MIRRORS TOOK A LITTLE GETTING USED TO BUT WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE THEY ARE INVALUABLE!
THE DAMN SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL
THE DAMPING OF VOLUME WHEN CHANGING BETWEEN RADIO PRESETS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE TOO WELL THOUGHT THROUGH FEATURES TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT DIDN T EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE IT S CLOYING AND BOTHERSOME 
THE DARK REAR WINDOWS ARE NOT GOOD FOR REAR VISIBILITY 
THE DASH BUTTONS ARE HARD TO PUSH
THE DASH CONTROLS CANNOT BE USED WITH GLOVES ON IN COLD WEATHER THIS IS ANNOYING NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED UPON 
THE DASH INFO IS LARGE AND EASY TO READ AND VERY BRIGHT IN FULL SUN THIS IS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT FROM 2012 GMC TRUCK 
THE DASH IS VERT SHINNY AND IS LARGE IT REFLECTS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD INITIALLY I HAD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE SURE I WAS SAFE IN CLOSE TRAFFIC ON A SUNNY DAY IT IS ESSENTIAL TO WEAR SUN GLASSES 
THE DASH SCREENS DISPLAY A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT IT IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES TAKING EYES OFF THE ROAD SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT DISPLAY HAVING TWO SCREENS TO VIEW ADDS TO THE ISSUE 
THE DASHBOARD FEATURES ARE A LITTLE HARDER TO SEE AS I AM TALLER THEN YOUR AVERAGE WOMAN
THE DASHBOARD SCREEN AND A/C CONTROLS ARE OUTDATED MY WIFE S 2009 NISSAN HAS IDENTICAL APPEARANCE 6 YEARS LATER IT S TIME FOR A MAKEOVER SOMETHING MORE VISUALLY OR AESTHICALLY APPEALING WOULD BE NICE ESPECIALLY ON A LUXURY VEHICLE
THE DATA ENTRY FOR THE NAV SYSTEM IS AWFUL THE DESIGNER FOR THAT SYSTEM SHOULD BE FLOGGED MAKE IT LIKE ADDRESSING AN ENVELOPE 
THE DATA MODEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN 4G LTE AND NOT 3G IN 2015 THAT IS A REAL JOKE!! THE APPS TAKE FOREVER TO LOAD WHY WOULD I EVEN USE THEM 
THE DATABASE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS IGNORANT COMPARED TO THE PORTABLE GPS DEVICES I HAVE USED IN THE PAST VERY DISAPPOINTING 
THE DAY I PURCHASED MY VEHICLE THE SALES PERSON WAS UNABLE TO ESTABLISH WHY TEH TEXT MESSAGING SERVIC EWAS UNAVAILABLE AND I STILL CANNOT FIGURE IT OUT I DID EVERYTHING BY THE MANUAL AND IT STILL DIDN T WORK
THE DEALER COULD HAVE EXPLAINED HOW TO USE THE WIFI AND EXPLAINED THE CONTROLS ON THE STEREO BETTER 
THE DEALER INSTALLED A DVD SYSTEM IN THE VEHICLE FOR US SINCE THEY SAID THAT GMC DOESN T PROVIDE THEM AS OFTEN ANYMORE PRE INSTALLED WE WERE NOT INFORMED PROPERLY THAT WHEN THE DVD WAS IN OPERATION IT WOULD COMPLETELY OBSTRUCT THE BACK WINDOW WE 
THE DEALER IS HAVING A TRAINING CLASS IN A FEW WEEKS THIS IS A GREAT IDEA I HOPE TO GET FAMILIAR WITH ALL THE GADGETS THEN IF NOT I AM GOING TO GET A FEW OF MY GRANDCHILDREN TO SHOW ME HOW TO MAKE IT WORK 
THE DEALER TRIED TO CONNECT MY PHONE S PANDORA TO THE CAR AND FAILED I DON T KNOW IF IT S MY PHONE OR THE CAR AND NOW I CAN T EVEN FIND THE MENU FOR IT THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT VERY SENSITIVE WHICH MAKES IT HARD TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING 
THE DEALER WENT ON AND ON ABOUT THESE FABULOUS SPEAKERS THEY ARE FINE BUT NOTHING SUPERIOR 
THE DEALERSHIP INSTALLED A 4 INCH LIFT IN THE VEHICLE WHILE IT MAKES THE PICKUP LOOK AWESOME IT MAKES THE HEADLIGHTS LESS EFFECTIVE 
THE DEALERSHIP OR SUBARU NEED TO SET UP CLASSES TO EXPLAIN AND TEACH THE USERS HOW TO UTILIZE ALL THE FEATURES THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS TECH SAVY AS THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE DIFFICULTY PERFORMING OR UTILIZING ALL THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NAVIG 
THE DEALERSHIP STALLED LIFT KIT MAKES THE VEHICLE S STEERING VERY SENSITIVE WE WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DEALERSHIP MODIFIED VEHICLE AND MAY END UP TRADING THIS ONE OFF 
THE DEEP RICH TONE FROM THE SPEAKERS 
THE DEFAULT VOLUME FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TOO LOW 
THE DEFOGGER DOESN T WORK WELL WITH DRIVER DOOR WINDOW
THE DEFROST SYSTEMS WORK VERY FAST WHICH IS CONVENIENT IN COLDER WETTER WEATHER CONDITIONS 
THE DEFROSTER WORKS PERFECT & I CAN SEE CLEARLY 
THE DELAY BETWEEN USING SIRI WITH BLUETOOTH LEADS TO MISTAKES IT GOES INTO PHONE CALL MODE A DIRECT LINK NOT USING IT AS A PHONE CALL FOR INSTRUCTIONS AND SHORTENING THE DELAY TIME FOR BLUETOOTH DISCOVERY AND ACTIVATION 
THE DESIGN ALLOWS FULL VISIBILITY IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WITHOUT THE HOOD OBSTRUCTING ANYTHING LIKE ON SOME OTHER VEHICLES 
THE DESIGN COULD BE IMPROVED THE COLOR THEME IS KINDA BORING 
THE DESIGN INTEGRATE WITH THE VEHICLE THE SCREEN IS IN A POSITION THAT SUNSHINE DOES NOT IMPACT THE FULL VISION
THE DESIGN LOOKS A BIT OLD FASHIONED 
THE DESIGN OF THE BACK HATCH MAKES SEEING AT THE VEHICLE DRIVERS SIGHT LINE PROBLEMATIC YOU EITHER HAVE TO SCRUNCH DOWN OR LEAN UP TO SEE ABOVE THE BAR IN THE BACK WINDOW 
THE DESIGN OF THE ENCORE S VEHICLES AUDIO COMMUNICATION AND ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS PERFORM SUPERBLY 
THE DESIGN OF THE FRONT CONSOLE INCORPORATING COLOR LIGHTS WITH THE SYSTEM IN A VERY ENTERTAINING WAY VERY UNIQUE MINI CREATIVITY 
THE DESIGN OF THE FRONT HOOD ON MY 2015 NISSAN MURANO IS SUCH THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE OVER FRONT PARKING IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO MEASURE IF THERE IS AN OBSTACLE IN THE WAY 
THE DESIGN OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WASHERS CAUSES WATER FROM THE DRIVERS SIDE TO BE THROWN ON THE PASSENGER SIDE AFTER THE PASSENGER S WIPER BLADE HAS ALREADY COMPLETED A WIPE THIS LEAVES A LOT OF WATER IN THE PASSENGER S VIEW 
THE DESIGN OF THE HOOD COLLECTS WATER WHEN RAINING AND UPON SLOWING DOWN SPLASHES WATER ONTO THE WINDSHIELD 
THE DESIGN OF THE ON SCREEN LOOK WHEN THE RADIO IS ACTIVATED THE TIME IS REDUCED TO TINY WHILE THE STATION NUMBER IS GIGANTIC I WOULD CHANGE THE SIZING AND APPEARANCE IF I COULD 
THE DESIGN OF THE REAR HATCH WITH THE CROSS BAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REAR VIEW IS VERY AWKWARD THAT NEEDS A RE DESIGN TO CLEAR THE OBSTRUCTION 
THE DESIGN OF THE SYSTEM AND THE EASE AND USE OF THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS
THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE IS WHAT IS ATTRACTIVE SO THE VISABILITY ITEMS ARE ANTICIPATED AND EXPECTED FOR WHAT THEY ARE 
THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE MAKES REAR VISIBILITY DIFFICULT I HAVE ALSO FOUND MERGING INTO TRAFFIC DIFFICULT DUE TO THE LARGE PILLAR BETWEEN FRONT DRIVER DOOR AND THE BACK DOOR I NOTICED THIS DURING MY INITIAL TEST DRIVE AND THAT S WHY I ORDERED T 
THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLES REAR WINDSHIELD MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF IT BUT HAVING THE CAMERA HELPS ALSO THE SIDE MIRRORS SOMEWHAT BLOCK VISION AT INTERSECTIONS 
THE DESIGN SOFTWARE IS NOT AT ALL IMPRESSIVE AND IN FACT LOOKS A BIT CHEAP OTHERWISE EVERYTHING IS GREAT 
THE DESIGN/LAYOUT OF THE DISPLAY AND OTHER CONTROLS BOTH IN THE CENTER OF THE DASHBOARD AND ON THE STEERING WHEEL IS WELL PLACED AND EASY TO USE 
THE DIAL I WOULD ADD TOUCH SCREEN
THE DIAL ON THE CENTER CONSOLE IS EXTREMELY EASY TO USE WITH THE UPRIGHT DISPLAY I CAN JUMP SCREENS QUICKLY I ALSO LOVE THAT THE BLUETOOTH RAPIDLY CONNECTS AND HOLDS BETTER RECEPTION IN BAD AREAS THAN WHEN I AM ON MY PHONE WITHOUT IT THE BUI 
THE DIAL SYSTEM OF INPUTTING AN ADDRESS COULD BE STREAMLINED 
THE DIAL THAT CHANGES STATIONS IS CONFUSING IT S A KNOB ON THE CONSOLE AREA AND IT FEELS LIKE IT SHOULD TURN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO INCREASE OR DECREASE THE NUMBER OF THE STATION THAT I M LOOKING FOR 
THE DIAL THAT CONTROLS THE RADIO STATIONS IS ANNOYING I GO PAST THE STATION AND THEN PAST IT AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE I GET THE DIAL TO STOP ON THE STATION I WANT A DIAL OR BUTTON THAT WAS MORE DEFINITE WHEN LANDING ON A STATION WOULD BE GRE 
THE DIAL TO CHANGE THE RADIO CHANNELS SHOULD BE ON THE LEFT I HAVE TO REACH ACROSS TO THE RIGHT DIAL TO CHANGE THE SIRIUS XM STATIONS WITH THE DIAL ALSO I LIKED THE PLACEMENT OF THE PHONE STUFF BETTER ON THE 2012 ROGUE 
THE DIALS ARE SMALL I WISH THE TIME AND TEMP WERE LARGER AND THE CABIN TEMPS WERE SMALLER SOMETIMES THE SPEED DIAL AUTO DIALS RECIPIENTS 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO PICK UP A PHONE CALL AND END A CALL WERE NOT OBVIOUS TO ME AT FIRST I HUNG UP ON PEOPLE A FEW TIMES BEFORE I WAS ABLE TO REMEMBER WHICH CAN BE A LITTLE DISTRACTING RED/GREEN COLOR CODI 
THE DIGITAL DISPLAY COULD LOOK MORE MODERN 
THE DIGITAL DISPLAY IT IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR WHAT IS BEING DISPLAYED 
THE DIGITAL READOUT OF CATEGORIES AND TUNES ON SATELLITE RADIO IS LIMITED TO EIGHT CHARACTERS WHERE IT S OBVIOUS THAT THE STATION IS SENDING OUT MORE INFORMATION
THE DIMMING OF THE MIRRORS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO JUDGE DISTANCE OF VEHICLES
THE DIRECTIONS IN THE MANUAL DIDN T CORRESPOND TO HOW WE NEED TO SET UP DIFFERENT ASPECTS SUCH AS THE PHONE ALSO SETTING FAVORITE STATIONS AND FINDING OTHER STATIONS ON THE ROAD IS NOT EASY WE DON T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE SATELLITE RADIO OR NAV 
THE DIRECTIONS TO THE NEAREST GAS STATION WHEN FUEL TANK IS LOW ARE EASY TO USE AND ACCURATE 
THE DISPLAY
THE DISPLAY & NAVIGATION FOR SIRIUS RADIO IS FANTASTIC
THE DISPLAY AND CONTROLS ARE SO EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND NO OTHER CAR HAS THIS MUCH TECHNOLOGY AT YOUR FINGERTIPS I M A TECH MAVEN AND I ENJOY EXPLORING AND LEARNING THE CAPABILITIES OF THIS CAR 
THE DISPLAY AND LAYOUT 
THE DISPLAY AND QUALITY
THE DISPLAY AND RENDERING OF THE MAP ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN ALONG WITH THE ACCURACY OF THE ROUTE COULD BE IMPROVED THE DISPLAY SHOULD LOOK MORE LIKE WHAT A DISPLAY IN A BMW OR MERCEDES LOOKS LIKE SINCE THE PRICE FOR THE VEHICLE IS COMPARABLE 
THE DISPLAY AND THE EASE OF THE CONTROLS I JUST HAVE TO TAKE THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE TO EVALUATE THE PROBLEM WITH THE VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ALWAYS UNDERSTAND MY REQUESTS 
THE DISPLAY BOX IS FIXED ON TOP OF THE DASHBOARD AND SHOULD EITHER RETRACT AND POP UP OR BE BETTER INTEGRATED INTO THE DASHBOARD ITSELF
THE DISPLAY COLOR IS ORANGE IT SHOULD BE BLUE OR GREEN EVEN RED WOULD BE BETTER ORANGE LOOKS LIKE SOME CHEAP MONOCHROME DISPLAY 
THE DISPLAY COULD BE LARGER OR INCREASE THE SIZE OF THINGS LIKE ARTIST AND TITLE MAKE IT EASIER TO CHANGE SOURCE 
THE DISPLAY FOR THE MYSYNC SYSTEM IS VERY BRIGHT AND ATTRACTIVE TO LOOK AT 
THE DISPLAY HAS TOO MANY STEPS I M CONSTANTLY HAVING TO PRESS BUTTONS TO GET BACK TO DIFFERENT SCREENS IT S TOO CUMBERSOME 
THE DISPLAY IS A BIT ARCHAIC TO THAT OF A SMARTPHONE APP E G GOOGLE MAPS
THE DISPLAY IS A BIT DATED BUT FUNCTIONAL 
THE DISPLAY IS A BIT OUTDATED AND NOT A TOUCH SCREEN
THE DISPLAY IS A BIT UNEXCITING AND THE CONTROLS ARE NOT ALWAYS INTUITIVE EVEN AFTER THREE MONTHS 
THE DISPLAY IS AWESOME AND THE BOSE SYSTEM SOUNDS AMAZING IN THE CAR I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS 
THE DISPLAY IS CLEAN AND EASILY READ THE INTERFACE IS INTUITIVE AND MINIMALIST 
THE DISPLAY IS CLEAR AND EASY TO READ
THE DISPLAY IS CONFUSING I WOULD LIKE TO SEE NAVIGATION/AIR/AND RADIO AND SOME DAYS I HIT THE BUTTONS JUST RIGHT I CAN SEE IT SOME DAYS I HIT AND HIT AND CAN T FIND THE RIGHT CONNECTION 
THE DISPLAY IS FUNCTIONAL BUT SEEMS A BIT DATED 
THE DISPLAY IS HARD TO USE AND REALLY HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING THE AUDIO/NAVIGATION SYSTEM SPLIT SCREEN IS HARD TO GET TO THE AUDIO SIDE TO CHANGE RADIO STATIONS IT ALSO LOCKS YOU OUT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS DRIVING TO NAVIGATE TO SOMETHING ELSE 
THE DISPLAY IS MUCH EASIER TO READ THAN IT WASIN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE 2012 BUICK REGAL I LIKE THE ADVANCEMENTS 
THE DISPLAY IS NOT AS SLEEK AS I D LIKE IT TO BE ESPECIALLY FOR BT STREAMING SOME ADDITIONAL EFFORTS CAN BE PUT IN THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE CONSOLE
THE DISPLAY IS NOT CONFIGURABLE AND THE BUTTONS TOO SMALL
THE DISPLAY IS NOT USER FRIENDLY ENOUGH OR EASY ENOUGH TO USE WHILE DRIVING I FIND MYSELF TAKING MY EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR TOO LONG TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS I LIKE THE STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS 
THE DISPLAY IS OKAY BUT A LITTLE SMALL EVERYTHING FUNCTIONS OKAY OTHER THAN THE PAIRING PROBLEM I SPOKE OF 
THE DISPLAY IS SMALL
THE DISPLAY IS TINY A LARGER DISPLAY IS NEEDED IDEALLY TOUCHSCREEN 
THE DISPLAY IS TOO BRIGHT AND BUSY I WOULD PREFER THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM FOR THE RADIO WHERE YOU CAN FLOW THRU THE GROUPS OF STATIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO SWIPE THE SCREEN ALSO THE ABILITY TO SHUT THE BACK UP CAMERA OFF 
THE DISPLAY IS TOO DIM TO BE SEEN WELL DURING DAYLIGHT 
THE DISPLAY IS TOO SMALL THE NAVIGATION DOESN T WORK UNLESS THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED AND THE TRAFFIC ALERTS ARE INCORRECT THE MAP IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO SEE AND DOESN T SHOW THE STREETS UNTIL YOU ARE RIGHT ON THEM WHICH IS USUALLY TOO LATE TO GET 
THE DISPLAY IS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND THE NAVIGATION IS VERY ACCURATE 
THE DISPLAY IS VERY CLEAR AND LOOKS FANTASTIC THE COLOR SCHEME MATCHES THE DASH 
THE DISPLAY IT IS SOMEWHAT DATED 
THE DISPLAY ITSELF IS VERY BLAND AND DULL EXPANDING THE APPEARANCE AND FEATURES WOULD BE NICE
THE DISPLAY LOOKS DATED 
THE DISPLAY NEAR MY SPEEDOMETER IS WONDERFUL SO I ONLY NEED TO LOOK DOWN WITH MY HEAD STRAIGHT INSTEAD OF LOOKING TO THE SIDE TO LOOK AT THE CENTER CONSOLE DISPLAY HEADS UP DISPLAY WOULD BE NICE TO A POINT 
THE DISPLAY OF THE AUDIO INFO THE DISPLAYED USED IS TOO SMALL AND PACKED WITH TOO MUCH INFO YOU NEED A BIGGER DISPLAY TO PRESENT THE INFO MORE EASILY 
THE DISPLAY OF THE GARMIN NAVIGATION IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE ONE IN MY LAST JEEP PATRIOT GARMIN SYSTEM CONTRAST BETWEEN ROAD AND SURROUNDINGS IS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH AND I VE TRIED EVERY SETTING ALSO NEW GARMIN NAV MENU IS NOT AS INTUITIVE AS MY L 
THE DISPLAY OF THE RADIO IS A BIG TOWER YUK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SONG TITLE AND ARTIST INSTEAD 
THE DISPLAY ON MY STEREO IS VERY PLAIN AND UGLY
THE DISPLAY PANEL FACES UP AND AWAY FROM THE DRIVER I M SHORT SO THIS MAY ONLY BE AN ISSUE FOR ME BUT I FIND MYSELF LEANING OVER TOO FAR TO USE THE TOUCH DISPLAY AND MY SEAT IS PRETTY CLOSE WHERE MY KNEES ALMOST TOUCH THE STEERING COLUMN 
THE DISPLAY SCREEN IS BEST IN CLASS
THE DISPLAY SCREEN NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIGGER AND NEEDS SHIELDING FROM OUTSIDE LIGHT ITS HARDER TO SEE DURING THE DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN USING REAR CAMERA 
THE DISPLAY SHOWS THE STATION OPTIONS AND I CAN EASILY CHANGE TO DIFFERENT STATIONS
THE DISPLAY UNIT ISN T RELIABLE AND OFTEN HARD TO READ
THE DISPLAYS ARE BEAUTIFUL WITH CUSTOMIZABLE VIEWS PROVIDE INSIGHTFUL INFORMATION AND ARE VERY INTUITIVE TO USE THE SOUND FROM MY AUDIO SYSTEM IS MUCH BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLES 
THE DISPLAYS COULD GIVE MORE SONG DETAIL FULL TITLE NAME FULL ARTIST NAME IT ONLY SHOWS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CHARACTERS BUT APPEARS TO HAVE ROOM TO SHOW MORE 
THE DISPLAYS OF THEM AND THE EASE OF USING THEM IN REGARDS TO THE SOFTWARE/STORAGE/DISPLAY 
THE DISTRONIC PLUS ACTIVE CRUISE CONTROL IS THE REASON I BOUGHT THE CAR IT AUTOMATICALLY CONTROLS THE DISTANCE TO THE CAR IN FRONT AND DOES SO VERY PRECISELY IT GREATLY INCREASES SAFETY IT GREATLY REDUCES DRIVER FATIGUE IN TRAFFIC AND ON LONG T 
THE DOCUMENTATION ACCOMPANYING THE CAR IS PRETTY BAD THERE COULD BE BETTER STEP BY STEP DOCUMENTATION ON HOW TO DO THE NORMAL ACTIVITIES
THE DODGE CHALLENGER HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF BLIND SPOTS AND IS ALSO VERY EASY TO SEE OUT OF COMPARED TO MUSTANGS OTHER CARS LIKE SO 
THE DON T TALK TO THE COMPUTER BECAUSE IT DOESN T LIKE ME AND WON T ANSWER OR UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY I M A RETIRED TEACHER AND SPEAK CLEARLY 
THE DOOR FRAME WHERE THE MIRRORS ARE MOUNTED IS A LITTLE TOO THICK REDUCING VISIBILITY 
THE DOOR FRAMES LOCATION HITS RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF MY PERIPHERAL VISION MAYBE IF THEY WERE FURTHER BACK WIDER DOOR OR FURTHER AWAY FROM PASSENGER WIDER BODY 
THE DOOR POSTS SEEM TO BE LARGER THAN THEY NEED TO BE IT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO SEE CLEARLY WHEN MAKING A RIGHT TURN AS POST BLOCKS CLEAR VIEW HAVE TO MAKE SURE TO LOOK AROUND POST WHEN MAKING LEFT TURN TOO 
THE DOORS ARE DIFFICULT AND HEAVY TO HANDLE ON WINDY DAYS LOCATION OF ARM REST/HAND GRIP IS HARD TO HOLD AS IT IS TOO FAR FORWARD NEEDS TO BE MORE POSTERIOR IT S HARD TO GRAB TO KEEP DOOR FROM GETTING AWAY FROM MY GRASP 
THE DOORS DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY LOCK WHEN DRIVING THE FRONT DOORS DO NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE IT THEY ARE LOCKED I FEEL THOSE ARE BOTH SAFETY CONCERNS IF IN AN ACCIDENT YOU SHOULDN T HAVE TO UNLOCK THE DOOR TO GET OUT 
THE DOPPLER EFFECT WHEN ONE READ WINDOW IS DOWN IS VERY ANNOYING 
THE DOUBLE CAB SEEMS TO HAVE A FEW MORE BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHILE IN THE DRIVERS SEAT 
THE DOWNLOAD TIME FOR TEXT MESSAGES IS LENGTHY AND SHOULD BE IMPROVED 
THE DOWNSIDE THAT THE FRONT HOOD IS SLANTED BODY STYLE CAUSES THE VISORS NOT BE EFFECTIVE SINCE THE SUN HITS DIRECT ON STEERING WHEEL JUST WISH THE VISORS WERE MORE ADJUSTABLE AND BIGGER 
THE DOWNWARD SLOP OF THE HOOD MAKES IT HARD WHEN PARKING IN A PARKING LOT IT IS HARD TO TELL WHERE THE FRONT BUMPER IS WHEN PULLING IN 
THE DREAM CONTINUES 
THE DRIVE TRAIN PROVIDES A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN ADVERSE WEATHER 
THE DRIVER 
THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER DOORS NEED INTERIOR MARKER LIGHTS FOR WHEN THE DOORS ARE OPEN AT NIGHT
THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SEATS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO EXIT 
THE DRIVER ASSISTANCE PLUS PACKAGE IS GREAT THE HEADS UP DISPLAY UNIT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONES REALLY LIKE HAVING POSTED SPEED LIMIT INCLUDED IN THE HUD 
THE DRIVER ASSIY PACKAGE IS GREAT AND USE THE SIDE WARNING LIGHTS WHEN CHANGING LANES ALL THE TIME THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ALSO AWESOME AND REALLY MAKE IT EASY TO SEE IN THE DARK I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THIS CAR 
THE DRIVER I TEND NOT TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY I M 72 YEARS OLD!
THE DRIVER IS AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD FEMALE SO THESE PARTICULAR AMENITIES ARE NOT ATTRACTIVE OR UTILIZED 
THE DRIVER ME COULD BE MORE AWARE OF WHAT S AVAILABLE!
THE DRIVER MIRROR IS NOT BIG ENOUGH AND MY BLIND SPOT IS BAD 
THE DRIVER NEEDS TO CHECK THE RIGHT HAND BLIND SPOT IS ALL I CAN THINK OF
THE DRIVER S SEAT NEEDS TO BE HIGHER I WOULD HELP IF I CAN SEE THE FRONT OF THE CAR THE VISIBILITY IS SOMEWHAT HARD BUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS REALLY HELPS AS WELL AS THE CAMERA MONITOR IT WOULD HELP IF THE BACK CAMERA PROVIDES A MORE ACCURATE 
THE DRIVER S SEAT SHOULD BE REENGINEERED TO GO A LITTLE LOWER TO ACCOMMODATE DRIVERS WITH LONGER TORSOS THE WINDSHIELD WASHER SPRAYERS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PRESSURE TO GO HIGHER THAN THE LOWER HALF OF THE WINDSHIELD 
THE DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT IS TERRIBLE WHEN THE TOP IS UP 
THE DRIVER S SIDE DOOR POST IS SOMEWHAT HARD TO SEE AROUND WHEN CHECKING TRAFFIC IN THE ADJACENT LANE 
THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR BLOCKS SOME VIEW ON THE LEFT SIDE WHILE MAKING A LEFT TURN OR CURVING LEFT 
THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR HAS A LARGE BLIND SPOT IT IS EASY TO LOSE PARTICULARLY A SMALL CAR THAT IS BESIDE YOU 
THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR HAS A LITTLE BLIND SPOT SECTION WHICH IS GREAT FOR CHECKING FOR CARS WHEN CHANGING LANES ADD THAT LITTLE EXTRA BLIND SPOT MIRROR TO THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR TOO!
THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR IS A LITTLE GOOFY WITH THE ZONE ON THE OUTSIDE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO EXPAND THE VIEW I DON T GET MUCH USE OUT OF THAT AND IT IS POTENTIALLY MORE ANNOYING THAN USEFUL 
THE DRIVER S SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A TWO PIECE DESIGN I WISH IT WERE ONE LARGE MIRROR IT S DIFFICULT USING TWO SMALL PIECES ONE OF THE WORST FEATURES ON THE CAR I WISH THE WIPERS HAD MULTIPLE INTERMITTENT SPEEDS 
THE DRIVER S SIDE SUN VISOR DOES NOT EXTEND FAR ENOUGH BACK TO COMPLETELY BLOCK THE SUN THROUGH THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW OTHER THAN THAT FLAWLESS 
THE DRIVER S SIDE SUN VISOR SHOULD BE MADE TO SLIDE BACK WHEN YOU HAVE IT POSITIONED TO BLOCK THE SUN THROUGH THE DRIVER S DOOR WINDOW 
THE DRIVER S SIDE VISOR DOES NOT EXTEND SO WHEN PLACED ON THE SIDE WINDOW IT IS ONLY AS LONG AS THE VISOR CANNOT BE PULLED TO EXTEND FURTHER TO BLOCK THE SUN ON THE SIDE 
THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDSHIELD PILLAR IS VERY THICK THIS RESULTS IN A MOVING BLIND SPOT WHEN TURNING LEFT 
THE DRIVER S SUN VISOR IS HARD TO GET A HOLD OF I STRUGGLE TO GET A GOOD GRIP 
THE DRIVER S VISOR WIDTH IS TO BIG
THE DRIVER S WINDSHIELD WIPER GO FARTHER TO THE LEFT 
THE DRIVER SEAT DOESN T GO DOWN AS FAR AS I WOULD LIKE I M 6 FOOT TALL THE BACKUP CAMERA IS HELPFUL AND USEFUL 
THE DRIVER SEAT DOESN T GO HIGH ENOUGH FOR SHORTER PEOPLE 
THE DRIVER SEAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADJUST HIGHER!!!!
THE DRIVER SEATBELT ACTUALLY HITS ACROSS MY CHEST IN A COMFORTABLE PLACE 
THE DRIVER SEATS HURT LOWER BACK WHICH IMPAIRS YOUR ABILITY TO DRIVE SAFELY 
THE DRIVER SHOULD BE ABLE TO TUNE THE RADIO WITHOUT TAKING ATTENTION FROM DRIVING BIG EASY TO FIND AND USE DIALS WOULD BE BETTER THAN HAVING TO READ THE AUDIO SCREEN 
THE DRIVER SIDE EXTENDED MIRROR IS SLIGHTLY AWKWARD FOR VIEWING BECAUSE OF THE DISTORTION CAUSED BY THE EXTENSION 
THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR IS A BLIND SPOT FOR ME WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN I HAVE TO RAISE MYSELF UP FROM THE SEAT IN ORDER TO SEE OVER THE MIRROR 
THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE OVER WHEN MAKING LEFT HAND TURNS
THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR IS QUITE LARGE AND IS HARD TO SEE AROUND SOMETIMES WHEN TURNING LEFT 
THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR IS TOO TINTED AND DOESN T ADJUST TO MY PREFERRED POSITION 
THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR SPLIT LACKS ENOUGH VISIBILITY FOR THE BLIND SPOT UNLESS THE MIRROR IS MOVED TO A LOCATION THAT REDUCES NORMAL LONG DISTANCE SIGHT LINE 
THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD HAS A GLARE FROM THE TWO DIFFERENT COLORS ON THE DASH THE DRIVER IS FORCED TO SEE THROUGH THIS WHICH CAN MAKE OBJECTS A LITTLE BLURRY THE FRONT PASSENGER HEADREST BLOCKS THE VIEW FOR THE RIGHT SIDE IF BACKIN 
THE DRIVER SIDE OUTSIDE MIRROR IS POSITIONED WHERE IT BLOCKS MY VIEW WHEN TURNING LEFT 
THE DRIVER SIDE POST CAUSES BLIND SPOT DIFFICULTIES I HAVE TO TURN MY HEAD AND QUICKLY FOCUS TO ENSURE THAT THE SPACE IS CLEAR 
THE DRIVER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS IN AN AWKWARD POSITION AND CAN AT TIMES MAKE LEFT HAND TURNS A LITTLE TOUGH TO MAKE SURE THERE ISN T A HAZARD
THE DRIVER SIDE REARVIEW MIRROR IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF BECAUSE OF GLARE 
THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW HOLDS WATER AND STREAKS THE WINDOWS WHEN OPERATING UP AND DOWN WHICH IS ANNOYING THIS HAPPENS EVEN AFTER DAYS AFTER RAIN OR WASH
THE DRIVER SIDE WIPER DOES NOT WIPE CLEAN IN THE RAIN PLAN TO HAVE THEM CHECK THIS OUT 
THE DRIVER SITS MUCH HIGHER IN THE CROSSTOUR RELATIVE TO THE DASH AND WINDOWSILLS THAN IN THE ACCORD THIS PROVIDES GREAT OUTWARD VISIBILITY AND IS MUCH PREFERRED BY MY SPOUSE WHO IS MUCH SHORTER BY COMPARISON YOU SIT DOWN LOWER IN THE ACCOR 
THE DRIVER SUN VISOR COVERS ABOUT A THIRD OF THE REARVIEW MIRROR THE BACK WINDOW IS SO SMALL THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE THE METAL OUTSIDE/INTERIOR ON THE SIDE WINDOWS BLOCKS THE VIEW TO THE FRONT WHEN GOING AROUND CURVES 
THE DRIVER SUN VISOR INTERFERES WITH THE DRIVER HEADREST WHEN THE DRIVER SEAT IS POSITIONED FORWARD AS MUCH AS IT CAN BE AND THE SUN VISOR IS POSITIONED WESTWARDLY 
THE DRIVER SUNVISOR STRIKES THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN FOLDED DOWN THIS REQUIRES ADJUSTMENT OF BOTH 
THE DRIVER TO SEE OVER THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE HOOD IS DIFFICULT 
THE DRIVER WIPER DOES NOT POSTION TO CLEAN THE FAR CORNER LOOKS TO BE DESIGN RELATED
THE DRIVERS ASSISTANCE/PLUS IS AN ADDITIONAL PLUS LANE DEPARTURE/BLISS/ACTIVE DRIVING ASSISTANCE MAKE YOU FEEL TRULY AT EASE AND SAFE WHILE DRIVING 
THE DRIVERS BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES ON THE HIGHWAY IS BAD 
THE DRIVERS MIRROR IS A GOOD ADDITION
THE DRIVERS OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR HAS AN ADDITIONAL CURVE AT THE OUTSIDE DIFFICULT TO SEE THE BENEFIT AND CAN BE CONFUSING 
THE DRIVERS POSITION IS HIGH UNLIKE MOST SMALL CARS GIVING A COMMANDING VIEW OF THE ROAD ALONG WITH PROPER SIDE VIEW MIRROR ADJUSTMENT TO ELIMINATE BLIND SPOTS MAKES VISIBILITY EXCEPTIONAL 
THE DRIVERS SEAT DOES NOT RAISE HIGH ENOUGH IM 5 6 AND THE SEAT WILL NOT GO UP AS HIGH AS I LIKE OR AS MUCH AS MY 2007 TAHOE
THE DRIVERS SEAT SHOULD HAVE A UPWARD CONTROL 
THE DRIVERS SIDE AND PASSENGER WINDOW DO NOT CLEAR ON THE OUTSIDE WHEN YOU ROLL THE WINDOW DOWN
THE DRIVERS SIDE BLIND SPOT IS VERY LARGE 
THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROW NEEDS AN ADDITION FOR THE BLIND SPOT WHEN A VEHICAL IS APPROCHING FROM THE REAR AND IT IS NO LONGER IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROW INSIDE THE VEHICAL THERE IS A BLIND SPOT
THE DRIVERS SIDE WASHER NOZZLE HAS A DELAY IN SPRAYING COMPARED TO THE PASSENGER SIDE 
THE DRIVERS SIDEVIEW MIRROR IS POSITIONED TO HIGH AT A 4 WAY STOP ITS HARD TO SEE SOME SMALLER CARS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
THE DRIVERS SUNVISOR CANNOT BE PULLER TO THE LEFT OF ONE S HEAD WHEN I DRIVE SINCE MY SEAT IS SO FAR FARWARD & I AM TALL
THE DRIVERS VISION IS OBSTRUCTED BY THE VEHICLE FRAME SURROUNDING THE WINDSHIELD AND SIDE WINDOWS 
THE DRIVERS WINDSHIELD WIPER SEEMS TO LEAVE A STREAK OF WATER IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER WHEN IT WIPES DOWN ALSO AS NOTED THE VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT MONITORS AND BACKUP SENSORS ALSO WHY IS THERE A BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE DRIVER SIDE BUT 
THE DRIVING SAFETY IS GOOD BUT THE SIGHT LINES ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT FRONT AS WELL AS THE REAR WINDOW SIGHT LINES ARE POOR
THE DROP DOWN SCREEN AS WELL AS THE HEIGHT OF THE 3RD ROW HEADRESTS WHEN UP OBSTRUCT THE REAR VISIBILITY 
THE DUAL SCREEN DOES NOT REALLY SEEM TO ADD MUCH VALUE WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE NAVIGATION 
THE DUAL SCREENS ARE NOT ONLY GREAT TO LOOK AT THEY OFFER A TON OF FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF HOW YOU DISPLAY THINGS I E SPLIT SCREEN FULL SCREEN AND WHAT INFORMATION YOU WANT TO SEE IN TERMS OF CONTENT THIS IS THE FIRST CAR I HAVE OWNED THAT 
THE DUAL SCREENS MAKE THE DISPLAYS EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND 
THE DVD PLAYERS IN REAR DO NOT HAVE TO CONNECT TO STEREO FRONT SPEAKERS 
THE DVD PLAYERS IN THE HEADRESTS THE GRANDBABY LOVES THEM!
THE DVD S DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY PLAY SO YOU HAVE TO USE THE REMOTE TO START THEM FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING AND CAN T SEE THE SCREEN IN THE BACK TO KNOW WHICH BUTTON TO PUSH MY OLDER HONDA ODYSSEY VAN JUST PLAYED EVERY DVD 
THE DVD SYSTEM AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A NICE FEATURE HOWEVER IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WOULD ALLOW THE PASSENGER TO USE IT WHILE I M DRIVING 
THE DYNAMIC CRUISE CONTROL FEATURE IS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE AND HELPFUL

THE EASE OF USE VIA THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS IS OUTSTANDING I WOULD LIKE THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO IMPROVE THOUGHT AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE IPOD PLAYLISTS WHEN ACCESSING MY MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH NOT JUST THE USB

THE EASE OF USING VOICE RECOGNITION 
THE EASE OF USING WHILE DRIVING
THE EASE OF VERBALLY ENTERING A DESTINATION ADDRESS A NEGATIVE IS THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT ACCESS A LIST OF YOUR STORED ADDRESS ORGANIZED BY THE DESTINATION NAME THEREFORE IF YOU FORGET THE EXACT DESTINATION NAME YOU VERBALLY USED WHEN YOU ORIG 
THE EASE OF VOICE RECOGNITION FOR TURNING RADIO CHANNELS
THE EASE OF WHICH IT CONNECTS TO MY SMART PHONE 
THE EASE ON ENTERING THE REAR PASSENGER SEAT COULD BE IMPROVED THE REAR DOOR IS TOO LOW PROMPTING BENDING YOUR HEAD I THINK TOO MUCH TO ENTER!
THE EASE THAT I CAN CHANGE CHANNELS
THE EASE TO USE ALL SYSTEMS IS OUTSTANDING 
THE EASE USING ON STAR
THE EASE WHICH I CONNECT MY SMARTPHONE
THE EASINESS OF IT S USE TO SWITCH FROM ONE TO ANOTHER IS GREAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SERVICE CHECK THE USB PORT BECAUSE OUR ONE CORD REPEATEDLY GETS STUCK ON THE PORT 
THE EASY ACCESS WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE DEVICE 
THE EASY OF ANSWERING THE PHONE WHICH BUTTON DOES WHAT WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING 
THE EASY OF SWITCHING AND SAVING CHANNELS BOTH REGULAR AND SATELLITE

THE ELECTRONICS PANELS EASE OF USE IS REMARKABLE FOR A FIRST TIME USER IT IS VERY INTUITIVE AND HAS GARNERED THE NAME OF GLADYS 
THE ELEGANCE OF THE CAR
THE ELS SOUND SYSTEM IN THE CAR IS ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST SOUND SYSTEMS IN A CAR I HAVE EVER BEEN THE SOUND IS VERY CRIP AND ACCURATE AND SOUNDS GREAT IN THE CABIN OF THE QUIET CAR 
THE ENCORE HAS GREAT VISIBILITY 360 
THE END CALL BUTTON DOESN T ALWAYS WORK
THE ENGINE CUT OFF IS IRRITATING I WOULD LIKE THE DEFAULT SETTING TO BE OFF RATHER THAN ALWAYS ON
THE ENJOY THE SOUND SYSTEM VERY MUCH AS I DRIVE ALONE MOST OF THE TIME 
THE ENTERING OF ADDRESSES SHOULD BE EASIER IT REQUIRES TO BE VERY PRECISE AND DOES AN INADEQUATE JOB OF SUGGESTING ALTERNATIVES
THE ENTERTAINMENT
THE ENTERTAINMENT AND AUDIO SYSTEMS ARE FANTASTIC 
THE ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAVE AN EXTREMELY SMOOTH INTERFACE VERY USER FRIENDLY 
THE ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THIS CARIS EXTREMELY EASY TO USE 
THE ENTERTAINMENT ASPECT IS GREAT SOUND QUALITY IS FAIR AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS GOOD ONCE YOU CAN GET THE ADDRESS INTO THE SYSTEM 
THE ENTERTAINMENT AUDIO IF EXCELLENT
THE ENTERTAINMENT SCREEN IN THE BACK FOR PLAYBACK OF DVDS 
THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM FOR THE DVD PLAYER SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE 
THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM INTERFERES WITH DRIVER CONCENTRATION A PUSH BUTTON RADIO WOULD BE PREFERABLE 
THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS AWESOME THE NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO USE I VE HAD TO USE THE NAVIGATION ON MY IPHONE BECAUSE THE PORSCHE NAV IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND MAKES MISTAKES 
THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS SPECTACULAR ITS EASY TO CONTROL AND EASY TO USE
THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS USER FRIENDLY AND PROVIDES EXCELLANT QUALITY
THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS VERY EASY TO USE BUT THE SOUND FROM THE SPEAKER SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO HAVE THAT GREAT DEEP SOUND FOUND IN OTHER VEHICLES I AM STILL GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
THE ENTERTAINMENT UNIT COULD BE BETTER INTEGRATED WITH PORTABLE DEVICES THERE IS NO APP INTERACTION EX FACEBOOK EMAILS ETC PUSH VIDEO WOULD BE PLEASING BUT MORE SO A BETTER DEFINITION SCREEN IT LOOKS DULL AND DATED AND PERHAPS A REVAMP OF 
THE ENTERTAINMENT/HEATING/COOLING SYSTEM JUST LOOKS BORING COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES I HACE COME ACROSS I WISH IT HAD MORE BUTTONS AND LIGHTS
THE ENTIRE BACK HATCH SHOULD BE GLASS TO ADD VISIBILITY OR TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE SIDE MIRROS AND THAT WOULD HELP WITH AN ALL AROUND VIEW OF SIDE BLINDSPOT AND REAR 
THE ENTIRE DASH IS REFLECTED IN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WHEN DRIVING INTO THE SUN AND IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM

THE EQUALIZER ON THE RADIO NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED THE BASS/TREBLE THERE IS NONE THE DISPLAY ON THE RADIO DOES NOT DISPLAY THE ARTIST AND SONG ON AM/FM STATIONS

THE EXCELLENT QUALITY OF THE BURMEISTER SOUND SYSTEM 
THE EXCELLENT SPEAKERS AND CRISP SOUND OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM 
THE EXITS ARE IDENTIFIED BY NUMBERS ONLY THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE THE NAME OF EACH EXIT TOO 
THE EXPANDED VIEWING AREA OF THE DRIVER S SIDE DOOR MIRROR IS TOO SMALL TO BE EFFECTIVE 
THE EXTERIOR DRIVER SIDE MIRROR CREATES A LARGE BLIND SPOT WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN
THE EXTERIOR LIGHTS ON THE EXTENDED MIRRORS ARE EXCELLENT GREAT RANGE AND BRIGHTNESS
THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS ARE SO HIGH THAT I OCCASIONALLY HAVE A PROBLEM SEEING PEDESTRIANS TO THE RIGHT OF THE VEHICLE WHEN STOPPED 
THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS CAUSE SOME BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT 
THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER THE SHAPE OF THEM CUTS OFF QUITE A BIT OF VIEWING AREA 
THE EXTERIOR STYLING
THE EXTERIOR STYLING DRIVES THE BLIND SPOT ISSUE IT S A TRADE OFF 
THE EXTERNAL MIRRORS SHAPE SMALL SIZE WITH THE ADDITIONAL LARGE VIEW INSERT CUTTING IN MAKE SEEING VEHICLES CLOSE BY DIFFICULT TO SEE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL HEAD MOVEMENTS WOULD PREFER A SQUARER OR MORE RECTANGULAR SHAPE THAN THE MORE AERODYNAMIC 
THE EXTRA FEATURES YOU HAVE ADDED E G ALARM WHEN CHANGING LANES ARE VERY GOOD THERE WAS NO QUESTION ABOUT THOSE FEATURES SO MAYBE IT IS COMING UP IN THE SURVEY BUT IN CASE IT ISN T I WANTED TO MENTION IT 
THE EXTRA MIRROR ON THE SIDE MIRRORS ALLOWS ME TO SEE CARS THAT MAY BE IN MY BLIND SPOT WHEN SHIFTING LANES I HAVE GOTTEN USE TO THEM AND LIKE THEM ALOT

THE EXTRA WEIGHT OF THE BATTERIES MAKES THE CAR HANDLE EXCELLENT IN SNOW
THE EYESIGHT DRIVER ASSIST TECHNOLOGY IS ONE OF THE BEST FEATURES OF MY OUTBACK THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD FEATURE ON ALL VEHICLES INCLUDING TRUCKS I NEVER REALIZED HOW OFTEN THE LANE DEPARTURE & SWAY IS ACTIVATED WHEN DRIVING MY BACK UP CAMERA

THE FACT THAT IT IS AVAILABLE TO HAVE SO MANY OPTIONS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS IS A LUXURY AND CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE WHEN TRAVELING 
THE FACT THAT IT SYNCS WITH MY DEVICES
THE FACT THAT THE AIR CONTROLS SHOULD BE SWITCHED TO WHERE THE RADIO CONTROL BUTTONS ARE IT IS EASIER FROM THERE THAN SO LOW WHERE THEY ARE NOW 
THE FACT THAT THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK WELL IS UNACCEPTABLE 
THE FACT THAT THE BLUETOOTH WIRELESS HOOKS UP BY ITS SELF
THE FACT THAT THE CAR DOESN T AUTOMATICALLY TOGGLE BETWEEN DAYTIME AND NIGHT MODES COLOR THEMES IS ABSURD IN THE CLASS OF VEHICLE HAVING TO MANUALLY CHANGE THE MODE MYSELF WHEN IT GETS DARK AND AGAIN IN THE MORNING IS ANNOYING AND AN AUTOMA 
THE FACT THAT THE CAR NEEDED A TOTAL ENGINE REPLACEMENT WITHIN A MONTH OF OWNING IT MADE ME DOUBT FORD S ABILITY TO SAFELY CONSTRUCT A VEHICLE 
THE FACT THAT THE HANDS FREE CEL CALLS ARE NICE AND CLEAR 
THE FACT THAT THE LOCAL SPEED LIMIT IS DISPLAYED ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS VERY HELPFUL AS IS THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC 
THE FACT THAT THE REAR WIPERS BECOME CONSTANT WHEN IN REVERSE IS A PLUS
THE FACT THAT THE VEHICLE HAS THESE FEATURES
THE FACT THAT THE VOICE CONTROL LINKS DIRECTLY TO SIRI ON MY IPHONE IS GREAT BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTROL ANYTHING NOT PHONE BASED ALSO THE CENTER INFO SCREEN NEEDS A BIT OF RE THINKING LIKE IT NEEDS TO RETURN TO RADIO DISPLAY AFTER USING PHO 
THE FACT THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAS TROUBLE WITH ACCURATELY RECOGNIZING SINGLE NUMBERS I E 1 2 3 MUCH LESS SPOKEN NUMBERS LIKE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX DOES DETRACT FROM A LOT OF THE OTHER GREAT FEATURE THAT HAVE A VOICE R 
THE FACT THAT WHEN A CALL COMES THROUGH THE MUSIC STOPS
THE FACT THAT YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FAVORITES TO THE HARD DRIVE AND PLAY THEM BACK ANYTIME IT ALSO IS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE THE PHONE HANDSFREE 
THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT ACCESS POI S WHILE DRIVING MAKES THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COMPLETELY USELESS I UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY ASPECT OF IT I AGREE ON NOT ALLOWING ENTERING IN ADDRESSES AND SUCH BUT TO NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE PRE POPULATED POI S T 
THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT READ THE WHOLE SONG TITLE ETC THE FRONT OF THE SCREEN GIVEN ITS SIZE IS RIDICULOUS WHY HAVE ONLY HALF OF IT USEFULL WHILE IT DISPLAYS A GRAPHIC ON THE OTHER HALF???
THE FACT THE DO NOT OFFER BACK UP CAMERA OF BACK UP SENSOR WITH THE TIRE IN BACK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE BEHIND JEEP
THE FACTORY HEADLIGHTS ARE TERRIBLE! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO MODERN VEHICLE STANDARDS
THE FACTORY INSTALLED NAVIGATION NOW HAS TRAFFIC UPDATES WAS NIT AVAILABLE BEFORE
THE FACTORY INSTALLED WIPER BLADES STREAKED SIGNIFICANTLY ON FIRST USE IMMEDIATELY REPLACED WITH AFTERMARKET BLADES THAT NOW WORK AMAZINGLY WELL 
THE FACTORY INSTALLED WIPERS ARE POOR
THE FACTORY SPEAKERS ARE NOT THAT GREAT AND THE VOLUME CHANGES FROM ONE DEVICE TO ANOTHER FOR EXAMPLE IF I SWITCH FROM BLUETOOTH TO FM RADIO THEN THE VOLUME CHANGES AS WELL 
THE FACTORY SPEAKERS ARE VERY LOW AND SOUND CHEAP IN ADDITION THERE ARE VERY FEW CONTROLS AVAILABLE TO ADJUST THE SOUND EQUALIZER NON EXISTENT 
THE FACTORY SPEAKERS DEFINITELY NEED IMPROVEMENT! MY 2001 NISSAN XTERRA HAD INCREDIBLE FACTORY SPEAKERS SO I EXPECTED SIMILAR QUALITY IN MY NEW NISSAN VEHICLE I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THEY MAKE THE MUSIC SOUND AS IF IT IS BEING PLAYED THROUGH 
THE FACTORY SPEAKS DONT HAVE THE GREATEST SOUND 
THE FACTORY SUBWOOFER IS WEAK AND UNDERPOWERED NOT ENOUGH CLEAN BASS DOOR SPEAKERS SHOULD CLIPPED TO PLAY ONLY MIDS AND HIGHS THEY ARE TRYING TO REPRODUCE LOW FREQUENCIES THEY CANNOT CLEANLY HANDLE OK TO MOST BUT NOT TO AUDIOPHILES EVEN 
THE FACTORY UNIT IS A A JOKE WITH FLAT SOUNDING SPEAKERS THAT QUICKLY DISTORT THE HEAD UNIT CONTROLS/DISPLAY IS UNAPPEALING BUT AT LEAST EASY ENOUGH TO OPERATE BLUETOOTH WORKS FINE FOR AUDIO AND CALLS BLUETOOTH WILL NOT ALWAYS AUTO CONNECT TO D 
THE FACTORY WIPERS ARE NOT GOOD HAD TO CHANGE THEM RIGHT AWAY WITH RAINX WIPERS
THE FADING IN AND OUT OF THE HD SIGNAL IS A HUGE DETRACTOR FROM THE QUALITY OF OUR LISTENING EXPERIENCE SO I WOULD IMPROVE ON THAT ALSO IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION QUALITY 
THE FASTER YOU DRIVE OTHER PEOPLE CAN NOT HER YOU ON THE BLUETOOTH SO ON THE HIGHWAY IT S A NO GO THEY CAN T HEAR YOU 
THE FASTEST SETTING FOR THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS IS NOT FAST ENOUGH 
THE FAVORITE CHANNELS BAR IS DIFFICULT TO SWIPE TO THE NEXT SET OF PRESET STATIONS 
THE FAVORITES SHOULD SCROLL WHEN YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT PAGE OF FAVORITES THAT IS SERIOUSLY DUMB THAT YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR FINGER TO CHANGE THE VISIBLE 5 FAVORITES HORRIBLE UI FOR A MOVING VEHICLE 
THE FEATURE FOR AUTO BRIGHT LIGHTS IS NOT EASY TO USE TOO TECH SAVVY FOR ME REQUIRES ME TO GET ANOTHER LESSON OR READ THAT FEATURE CHAPTER MULTIPLE TIMES
THE FEATURE THAT ON THE BACK UP CAMERA THE VEHICLE PATH INDICATOR LINES TURN WITH THE WHEEL IS MUCH APPRECIATED THAT AND THE NICE SIDE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS WERE VERY BIG FACTORS IN OUR DECISION TO PURCHASE 
THE FEATURES ARE ALL EXPENSIVE ADD ONS MOST OF THE MOST USEFUL FEATURES REQUIRE OUT RAVENOUSLY EXPENSIVE UPGRADE FOR VERY LITTLE GAIN 
THE FEATURES ARE VERY EASY TO USE AND EYE APPEALING PLUS THE SOUND SYSTEM/SPEAKERS ARE PRETTY AWESOME
THE FEATURES OF THE RADIO CONTROLS ARE NOT INTUITIVE IT S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT CAN BE CHANGED AND HOW TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS 
THE FEEL
THE FEEL GOOD FACTOR OF GOING ALL ELECTRIC 
THE FEEL OF SAFETY IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE VEHICLE 
THE FEEL OF THE RADIO CONTROL KNOB IS SQUISHY IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE IT WANTS TO COME OFF EVEN THOUGH IT IS WELL SECURED TO THE DASH BOARD THE PRE SELECTED RADIO STATION BUTTONS SHOULD HAVE A MORE SOLID FEEL WHEN A SELECTION IS ENTERED 
THE FEELING OF BEING SAFE WHILE DRIVING 
THE FEELING OF SAFETY
THE FEELING OF SAFETY IS UNSURPASSED 
THE FENDER AUDIO SOUND SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING! BETTER THAN ANY CAR AUDIO SYSTEM I VE EVER HEARD AFTER HEARING IT ONE TIME I HAD TO HAVE IT!
THE FENDER AUDIO SYSTEM SOUNDS AMAZING TRULY THE BEST STOCK SYSTEM THAT I VE EVER HAD IN A CAR THERE IS NO NEED TO CHANGE OR SUPPLEMENT THIS SYSTEM WITH AFTERMARKET PARTS 
THE FENDER AUDIO SYSTEM WITH BUILT IN SUBWOOFER IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING THE SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT AND HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BASS 
THE FENDER SOUND SYSTEM IS AMAZING 
THE FENDER SOUND SYSTEM IS NICE 
THE FIDELITY OF THE SYSTEM IS NOT UP TO THE STANDARD OF THE BOSE SYSTEM IN OUR GMC YUKON DENALI XL
THE FIDELITY WAS FLAT WITH LESS SOUND QUALITY THEN MY RX HAD REASON WAS SPEAKERS 
THE FIELD OF VIEW COULD BE INCREASED BY RAISING THE READ VIEW MIRROR
THE FIRST CAR I TRULY FEEL SAFE IN 
THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE WAS THE HIGH VISIBILITY IT OFFERED 
THE FIRST TIME ENTERING INFORMATION USING THE SPELL FUNCTION IT IS TEDIOUS TO DIAL THE LETTERS AND NUMBERS RATHER THAN A TOUCH SCREEN 
THE FIRST TIME I USED THE NAVIGATION THE VEHICLE ENDED UP IN THE WRONG PLACE 5 MILES OFF I HAVEN T CONNECTED MY PHONE OR AUDIO DEVICES BUT AN PLEASED THE CONNECTIVETY IS AVILABLE FOR FUTURE USE 
THE FIRST TIME WE HAD TO USE THE WIPERS/WASHERS WAS DURING THE SNOW STORM THE DAY OF THE SUPER BOWL WE LIVE IN MICHIGAN AND HAD TO DRIVE IN 4 6 INCHES OF SNOW THAT ALREADY FELL AND IT WAS SNOWING STILL THE WIPER/WASHERS WERE NOT KEEPING THE WI 
THE FLAP THAT COVERS THE USB PORT NEEDS TO BE HELD OPEN WHILE INSERTING USB PLUG OR DEVICE BECAUSE IT IS SPRING LOADED AND CLOSES WHEN YOU LET GO OF IT PLEASE FIX IT SO IT CAN BE OPENED AND STAY OPEN THIS WILL MAKE PLUGGING ITEMS INTO THE USB 
THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE DUAL DVD ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM
THE FLUID ONLY SPRAYS ABOUT 2 ABOVE THE WIPER BLADE IN FRONT
THE FLY WHEEL ON THE STEERING WHEEL THAT YOU ARE TO BE ABLE TO USE TO HANG UP DOESN T REALLY WORK WELL SO YOU HAVE TO USE THE CONTROL IN THE MIDDLE CONSOLE
THE FM 1 AND FM 2 HAVE DIFFICULTY STAYING IN MODE ONE YOU SWITCH TO THEM YOU HAVE TO WAIT 15 TO 20 SECONDS BEFORE SELECTING A CHANNEL ONCE YOU VE SWITCHED TO EITHER FM 1 / FM 2 / OR AM PERHAPS WE ARE NOT WORKING IT PROPERLY NO ONE SHOWED US 
THE FM AND AM RADIO RECEPTION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED A LOT ALSO MY PHONE FREEZES UP WHEN PLAYING PANDORA AND CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH TO THE CAR 
THE FM RADIO I LIKE BLUE GRASS
THE FM RADIO RECEPTION IS VERY POOR WORST I HAVE EVER HAD 
THE FOG LIGHT CONTROL SWITCH IS IN AN AWKWARD SPOT I HAD A FORD ESCAPE AND LIKED THE SWITCH CONTROL MUCH BETTER ALL THE LIGHTING WAS ON THE SAME SWITCH THERE IS NO TEMPERATE ENGINE GAGE DISPLAY I M USED TO SEEING ONE IN ALL MY PAST VEHICLES 
THE FOG LIGHTS ARE ALSO TRULY AMAZING 
THE FOG LIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL 
THE FOG LIGHTS ARE GREAT FOR FOG WE ALSO USE THEM AT NIGHT FOR FURTHER VISIBILITY 
THE FOLDING/TELESCOPING SIDE MIRRORS ARE GREAT!
THE FONTS ON THE NAV SCREEN SHOWING STREET NAMES ARE TOO SMALL AND NOT ADJUSTABLE 
THE FORD EXPLORER HAS GREAT VISIBILITY AND FEELS SAFE
THE FORD SYNC SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY EASY TO USE I USE VOICE COMMANDS FOR ALL RADIO AND TELEPHONE APPLICATIONS SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE PURCHASED THE UPGRADED SPEAKERS OPTION FROM FACTORY FOR BETTER SOUND QUALITY 
THE FORD SYNC SYSTEM IS NOT VERY GOOD IT S NOT OVERLY RESPONSIVE AND SOMETIMES DOESN T WORK CORRECTLY OR AS I VE STATED PREVIOUSLY DOESN T WORK AT ALL I BELIEVE FORD IS TRANSITIONING TO DIFFERENT SOFTWARE FOR THE SYSTEM SO I HAVE HIGHER HOPES 
THE FORWARD COLLISION SYSTEM WHICH AUTOMATICALLY BRAKES FOR YOU IS A BIT OVER SENSITIVE AND CAN BRAKE WHEN YOU ARE NOT IN DANGER 
THE FORWARD COLLISION UNIT HAS PREVENTED AN ACCIDENT ALREADY
THE FORWARD DISTANCE OF THE HEADLIGHTS COULD BE LONGER ON LOW BEAM 
THE FORWARD SENSORS COME ON AND WARN OF OBJECTS IN FRONT WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE THEY DO NOT WARN OF ANYTHING WHEN I PULL FORWARD TO PARK 
THE FORWARD VIEW WHEN DRIVING IS THE BEST 
THE FORWARD VISIBILITY FEELS LIKE IT CUTS OFF A PORTION FROM THE TOP IF USING A VISOR IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS 
THE FORWARD VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING AIDED BY THE GLASS VENT WINDOWS ADJACENT TO THE WINDSHIELD THE REAR VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING WHEN THE REAR HEADRESTS ARE FULLY LOWERED 
THE FORWARD VISIBILITY OF SUBARUS ARE ONE OF THEIR MOST UNDERRATED FEATURES 
THE FORWARD VISIBILITY OF THE CAR IS SIMPLY INCREDIBLE COUPLED WITH THE ABILITY TO RAISE THE HEIGHT OF THE POWER DRIVER S SEAT THIS CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL FEELING OF SAFETY 
THE FORWARD VISIBILITY WIPERS AND HEADLIGHTS ARE AMAZING ESPECIALLY THE HEADLIGHTS!
THE FOUR LED 918 STYLE HEADLIGHTS IS TOTALLY AWESOME DURING DAY AND NIGHT TIME DRIVING OTHER DRIVERS NOTICE THE 918 STYLE HEADLIGHTS FIRST 
THE FRAME AROUND THE WINDSHIELD IS A BIT WIDE MAKING FRONT END VISIBILITY LESS THAN PERFECT 
THE FRAME BETWEEN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND THE SIDE MIRROR CAUSES A BLIND SPOT IN ORDER TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING HIDDEN AT THAT ANGLE I MUST LEAN FORWARD TO LOOK AROUND IT 
THE FRAME OF THE VEHICLE IS OBVIOUSLY REQUIRED BUT PARTS GET IN MY LINE OF VISION 
THE FRAME ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS TOO WIDE CREATES QUITE A BLIND SPOT I HAVE TO LEAN FORWARD AND BACK IN ORDER TO BE SURE
THE FRAMING BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK DOORS BLOCKS VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT 
THE FRAMING OF THE CAR CREATES A BLOCKED VIEW FROM THE DRIVER S POSITION WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN THE DRIVER CANNOT SEE A FULL VIEW OF ON COMING TRAFFIC BECAUSE OF THIS BLOCKED VIEW 
THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF THE SPEAKERS IS A LITTLE STRANGE CERTAIN HIGH FREQUENCIES ESPECIALLY IN THE RANGE OF HUMAN BREATHING COME THROUGH SOMEWHAT CRACKLY 
THE FRONT A PILLAR IS MASSIVE I KNOW THIS IS DUE TO CRASH SAFETY BUT IT IS RIGHT IN THE VIEW OF THE ROAD WHEN TAKING A 45 DEG TURN TO THE LEFT IF YOU BEND FORWARD A LITTLE BIT THIS HELPS MODERN CARS ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE THIS AFTER THE ROLL OV 
THE FRONT AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT IN FACT IT IS ONE OF THE TOP THINGS I LOOKED FOR WHEN I TEST DROVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARS BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE TO RELY ON THE BACK UP CAMERA AND/OR WARNING SYSTEMS THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO BLIND SPOT IN 
THE FRONT AND SIDE WINDOWS ARE LOWER AND BIGGER THAN IN MY 2010 ACADIA AND IT IS NOW EASIER FOR THE DOG TO SEE OUT WE LOVE OUR NEW ACADIA ALL OF MY S!
THE FRONT AVOIDANCE IS BUGGY IT GOES OFF WHEN THERE IS NOTHING IN FRONT OF ME AND ONCE IT DID NOT GO OFF AND I ALMOST HIT ANOTHER CAR I WAS GOING THROUGH AN INTERSETION NO CARS AROUND AND IT ACTUALLY TIGHTENED UP THE SEAT BELT AND PREPARED ME 
THE FRONT CENTER DISPLAY FOR SIRIUS IS HORRIBLE! IT LOOKS LIKE A DESIGN FROM THE PAST I DISLIKE THE SCREEN COLORS AND THE NAVIGATION TO GO THROUGH IT COULD DEFINITELY BE IMPROVED ALSO THE CAMERA BACK MIRROR IN THE DISPLAY IS NOT VERY HELPFUL 
THE FRONT CLOSENESS WARNING WHEN PARKING IS VERY HELPFUL 
THE FRONT COLLISION SYSTEM WARNING IS VERY SENSITIVE WHEN DRIVING IN CONGESTION WITH CLOSER FOLLOW RANGE THE SYSTEM WARNS AT TIMES THAT DON T SEEM COMPLETELY NECESSARY 
THE FRONT CONSOLE CONTROL IS EASY TO READ AND OF A DECENT SIZE 
THE FRONT CORNER POSTS OBSTRUCT VISION CONSIDERABLY I HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO HITTING SOME ONE AND/OR SOME THINGS BECAUSE OF THIS PLEASE REDUCE THE SIZE OF THESE POSTS FOR BETTER VISION WHEN CORNERING AND FOR OTHER CARS BIKES AND PEOPLE THAT ARE IN 
THE FRONT DASH IS HUGE! I FEEL LIKE I CAN SEE EVERYTHING SO CLEAR 
THE FRONT DEFROSTER TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO I HOPE IT COMES IN HANDY IN THE COLD MONTHS 
THE FRONT DOOR FRAMES ARE AT AN ANGLE THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO GET IN AND OUT OF THE VEHICLE WITHOUT BUMPING MY HEAD BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THEY OBSTRUCT MY VIEW OF TRAFFIC COMING FROM MY SIDES ESPECIALLY AT STOP SIGNS THIS WAS ALSO A PROBLEM I 
THE FRONT DOOR PANEL SOMETIMES GETS IN THE WAY OF VISABILITY
THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER DOESN T CLEAN ENOUGH OF THE WINDSHIELD
THE FRONT DRIVERS WIPERS STREAK THE WINDSHIELD NEVER IS COMPLETELY WIPED CLEAN SAME WITH MY HONDA ODYSSEY BEFORE THAT AND THE ONE BEFORE THAT 
THE FRONT GLASS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENGINEERED AT AN ANGLE IDEAL TO BOUNCED ROCKS OFF WHICH ARE HITTING THE GLASS 
THE FRONT HEAD REST BLOCKS VISIBILITY TO EASILY LOOK OUT BACK 
THE FRONT HEADLAMPS DO NOT PROJECT FAR ENOUGH OUT THEY COULD ALSO HAVE BETTER WIDTH AS WELL 
THE FRONT HEADLIGHTS SHOULD TURN AS THE CAR TURNS 
THE FRONT HEADRESTS ARE SO LARGE IT FORMS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT EASY TO ADAPT TO IT HOWEVER 
THE FRONT HEADRESTS DONT GO DOWN FAR ENOUGH INTO THE SEAT WHICH HINDERS SOME VISIBILITY FOR DRIVER LOOKING BACKWARDS 
THE FRONT HOOD SHAPE SLIDING RIDGES POINTING TO THE FRONT GRILL ON EITHER SIDE MAKE WATER SPRAY UP ON THE WINDSHIELD IN A WEIRD ANNOYING WAY 
THE FRONT INTERIOR CORNERS THATGO FROM DASHBOARD TO ROOF THAT ALSO ACT AS SIDES FOR THE WINDSHIELD DO BLOCK YOUR VISION FOR THOSE CORNERS HARD TO SEE OBJECTS OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE IF YOU AR LOOKING OUT AT LIKE 15 DEGREE ANGLES 
THE FRONT LEFT AND RIGHT CORNER BLIND SPOTS ARE A LITTLE WORRISOME AT TIMES BUT EVERY CAR HAS THOSE BLIND SPOTS 
THE FRONT LEFT PILLAR BLOCKS VISIBILITY AND THE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL TO SEE BLINDSPOT
THE FRONT LEFT SIDE VIEW IS OBSTRUCTED 
THE FRONT MIRRORS SEEMS SMALL BUT THAT IS JUST MY OPINION 
THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE IS A BIT LOW AND OFTEN SCRAPES ON DRIVEWAYS/PARKING BLOCKS
THE FRONT PASSENGER HEADREST CAN BE ANNOYING WHEN BACKING UP SINCE IT HINDERS THE DRIVER VISIBILITY
THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT HEAD REST AND THE DOOR PILLAR LINE UP IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CREATE A LARGER THAN NORMAL BLIND SPOT I CAN LESSEN THE SIZE OF THE BLIND SPOT BY MOVING THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT ALL THE WAY FORWARD 
THE FRONT PILLAR MAKES IT HARD TO SEE WHEN GOING AROUND A CURVE TO THE LEFT PILLAR IS TOO THICK 
THE FRONT PILLAR POST ARE THICK AND BLOCK THE VIEW WHEN TURNING LEFT I BELIEVE THEY ARE THICK DUE TO REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFETY/CRASH SUPPORT I JUST MANEUVER MY HEAD AROUND WHEN TURNING TO GET A VIEW ON ONE SIDE AND THEN THE OTHER ESPECIALLY WHEN 
THE FRONT PILLARS ARE A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT 
THE FRONT PILLARS ARE SLOPED IN A WAY THAT FAVORS AERODYNAMICS BUT OBSTRUCTS SOME VISIBILITY THIS IS EVEN MORE TRUE FOR THE REAR PILLARS WHICH ARE THICK AND HEAVILY OBSCURE THE REAR QUARTER VIEW 
THE FRONT PILLARS CAN BLOCK YOUR VISIONTILL YOU GET USED TO MOVING AS NECESSARY TO SEE
THE FRONT PILLARS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDOW MAKE VIEWING DIFFICULT WHEN MAKING TURNS 
THE FRONT POST FOR WINDSHIELD IS HARD TO SEE AROUND CAUSING A BIG BLIND SPOT 
THE FRONT POSTS ARE HARD TO SEE AROUND YOU HAVE TO LEAN FORWARD TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS IN AREA
THE FRONT QUARTER PANELS HAVE A BLIND SPOT 
THE FRONT ROOF CORNER PANELS ARE FAIRLY WIDE CREATING SOMEWHAT OF A BLIND SPOT EITHER TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT 
THE FRONT ROOF PILLAR HAS A STEEP SLOPE AND IS TOO WIDE IT DIMINISHES THE FRONT VIEW NOW THAT I M CONSCIOUS OF IT I LOOK VERY CAREFULLY 
THE FRONT ROOF PILLARS CONTINUE TO OBSTRUCT VISIBILITY IT S TOO EARLY TO KNOW HOW GOOD THE WIPERS ARE BUT IN MY 2013 THEY DID A VERY POOR JOB OF CLEANING THE WINDSHIELD 
THE FRONT ROOF SUPPORTS CAN BLOCK VIEW OF TRAFFIC THAT IS NOT DIRECTLY AHEAD I MUST LEAN FORWARD OR TO THE LEFT/RIGHT TO CHECK FOR TRAFFIC THAT MAY BE AT AN ANGLE FOR INSTANCE TRAFFIC TURNING LEFT FROM THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION WHEN I AM IN THE F 
THE FRONT SEAT HEAD RESTRAINTS BLOCK SIDE VISIBILITY AND THE REAR SEAT RESTRAINTS BLOCK VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK ALSO I D LIKE A BIGGER REAE WINDOW 
THE FRONT SIDE PANELS SEEM TOO WIDE AND OBSTRUCT VISION WHEN TURNING
THE FRONT SIDE POSTS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES APPROACHING FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE OT THE VEHICLE WHEN AT AN INTERSECTION
THE FRONT SIDE POSTS SEEM TO BE EXTRA LARGE PARTIALLY OBSTRUCTING VIEW
THE FRONT SIDE VIEW CAMERA
THE FRONT SPEAKER SOUNDS LIKE IT HAS GONE BAD
THE FRONT STRUCTURAL ROOF BARS THAT ARE ON EACH SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD CREATE AN UNUSAL BLIND SPOT AT STOP SIGNS MORE VISUAL CARE IS REQUIRED LOOKING TO THE FORWARD LEFT AND RIGHT AS PEOPLE AND CARS CROSSING IN FRONT CAN BE LOST OR BLOCKED 
THE FRONT SUN VISORS ARE NOT LONG ENOUGH I PUT IT DOWN AND THE SUN IS STILL IN MY EYES BELOW THE VISOR AN EXTENSION TO PULL DOWN WOULD BE NICE 
THE FRONT SUNVISORS DON T EXTEND SIDEWAYS!!
THE FRONT SUPPORT BEAMS AND REAR VIEW MIRROR HAVE BLOCKED SIGHT OF TRAFFIC COMING FROM THE RIGHT 
THE FRONT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHERE THE SUPPORT FOR THE ROOF ON THE LEFT ON DRIVERS SIDE ALMOST HIT PEDS DUE TO BLIND SPOT WHEN IN PARKING LOT 
THE FRONT VISIBILITY IS LATERALLY IMPEDED BY THE PILLARS BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE FRONT DOORS THE PILLARS ARE TOO WIDE 
THE FRONT WASHERS COULD BE SPRAY TYPE INSTEAD ON THE OLD DOUBLE JETS 
THE FRONT WASHERS DON T SEEM TO BE THROWING OUT ENOUGH WASHER LIQUID AS IT WAS IN THE FIRST MONTH OF VEHICLE PURCHASE 
THE FRONT WINDOW FRAME CAN BLOCK AN ONCOMING CAR AND HIDE IN THE BLIND SPOT DON T KNOW HOW YOU CORRECT BUT I HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL I WISH THEY HAD A COMPARTMENT TO PUT SUN GLASSES IN NOT IN THE CONSOLE AND NOT WHERE THEY CAN INTERFERE WIT 
THE FRONT WINDOW IS A BIT SMALL HAVE TO BEND NECK DOWN TO SEE STOPLIGHTS SOMETIMES 
THE FRONT WINDOW IS VERY LARGE AND GREAT FOR VISIBILITY BUT THE SUN VISOR IS SMALLL AND I AM SHORT SO IT IS USELESS IN BLOCKING THE SUN VISOR NEEDS TO BE LARGER NOT WIDER BUT LONGER 
THE FRONT WINDOW PILLARS ARE TOO WIDE AND BLOCK THE VIEW DON T LIKE THIS AT ALL!
THE FRONT WINDOW PILLARS HAS SORT OF A BLIND SPOT 
THE FRONT WINDOW WINDSHIELD POST COUPLED WITH THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS SUBSTANTIALLY BLOCK SIGHT LINES WHEN TURNING PARTICULARLY TO RIGHT BUT ALSO TO THE LEFT IT S TRUE ON MOST VEHICLES AND I M NOT SURE IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE TO CORRECT THE PROB 
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD COLUMNS CREATE A MASSIVE BLIND SPOT 
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD GETS DIRTY FAST SO YOU NEED TO US ALOT OF WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD HAS NO COLOR TINTING AT THE TOP TO HELP WITH SUN GLARE AS OTHER VEHICLES HAVE ACCORDINGLY I HAVE TO USE MY SUN VISOR MORE FREQUENTLY ON SUNNY DAYS 
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS ENORMOUS! IT IS RAKED AT AN ANGLE THAT INCREASES THE VEHICLE S AERODYNAMICS AND PROVIDES TREMENDOUS VISIBILITY THE SIDE MIRRORS HAVE BUILT IN CONVEX MIRRORS ON THE EDGES OF THE LARGER MIRRORS THEY INCREASE VISIBILITY T 
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS LARGE AND ALLOWS EASE FOR THE DRIVE TO SEE ALL DIRECTIONS THE REAR WINDOW FROM DRIVERS SEAT IS A LITTLE SMALL 
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WASHER DESIGN IS SOMEWHAT FLAWED AS THE LEFT SIDE WIPER MOVES TO ITS DOWN POSITION AND MOVES QUITE A BIT OF WATER TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN WHILE THE RIGHT HAND WIPER DEPOSITS WATER ON THE LEFT SIDE WHEN IT S MOVING UP 
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WASHER SYSTEM DOES NOT PROPERLY WET THE ENTIRE WINDSHIELD WHILE DRIVING 
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPER IS A LITTLE LOW I HAVE TO STOP FURTHER BACK THAN NORMAL TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE STOP LIGHTS 
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPER PATHS APPEAR TO BE DESIGNED FOR EUROPEAN LEFT HAND DRIVING BECAUSE THE PASSENGER WIPER STOPS DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRIVER S SIGHT LINE VERY ANNOYING AND DISTRACTING 
THE FRONT WIPER BLADES ALWAYS LEAVES A LINE OF WATER ON THE WINDSHIELD THAT HINDERS WITH YOUR VISIBILITY 
THE FRONT WIPER SOMETIMES LEAVES A LITTLE STREAK THE CAR IS TINY SO IT IS NOT LIKE DRIVING A BIG SUV THAT FEELS TOTALLY IMPERVIOUS TO ANYTHING ON THE ROAD BUT IT IS RESPONSIVE AND FINE TO DRIVE I NEVER FEEL UNSAFE BECAUSE OF THE CAR 
THE FRONT WIPERS ARE INADEQUATELY SIZED FOR THE VEHICLE AND DO NOT EFFECTIVELY CLEAR THE WINDSHIELD 
THE FRONT WIPERS DO NOT CLEAR A LARGE ENOUGH AREA ON THE WINDSHIELD THERE IS A LARGE TRIANGLE SHAPE LEFT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM PART OF THE WINDSHIELD 
THE FRONT WIPERS DO NOT COVER THE ENTIRE WINDSHIELD 
THE FRONT WIPERS DOESN T GO FAST ENOUGH 
THE FRONT WIPERS FACTORY INSTALLED LEAVE A BIG SPLASH OF WATER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN THE WIPER HAS COMPLETED ONE SWIPE IT S RIGHT SMACK DAB IN FRONT OF THE PASSENGER SO THE WINDOW IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF 
THE FRONT WIPERS SPRAY HITS THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT 
THE FRONT WIPERS WORK GREAT BUT ARE NOISY
THE FRONT WIPERS WORK OK BUT LEAVE WATER ON WINDSHIELD BETWEEN THE BIG AND SMALL WIPERS
THE FRONTAND REAR VIEW CAMERAS ARE WELL DESIGNED
THE FUNCTIONS BEING IN THE STEERING WHEEL
THE FUSION IS A VERY SAFE VEHICLE 
THE FX RADIO TEXT MESSAGE SYSTEM AND HANDS FREE CALLING
THE GAP BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE BODY PANEL IS A BIG TURN OFF 
THE GARMIN SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ANALYZED AND RESEARCHED THIS WAS A DOWNGRADE FROM THE MERCEDES BENZ GPS SYSTEM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT MERCEDES DIDN T THROUGHLY DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE BEFORE CONTRACTING WITH GARMIN GARMIN HAS POOR CUSTOMER SERV 
THE GARMIN VERSION OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ALMOST WORTHLESS NO TRAFFIC UPDATES VOICE RECOGNITION FOR IT DOES NOT WORK AND OCCASIONALLY GLITCHES I USED TO USE A GARMIN STAND ALONE UNIT THAT HAD THE ABOVE FEATURES AND NO ISSUES SO NOT SUR 
THE GAS GAUGE IS HIDDEN BEHIND THE STEETING WHEEL 
THE GAS GAUGE IS REALLY HARD TO SEE IN THE DAYLIGHT 
THE GAUGE SHOWING TURNS
THE GERMAN S ARE BEHIND THE REST OF THE WORLD IN THAT THEY DO NOT USE TOUCH SCREEN FOR NAVIGATION YOU HAVE TO USE THE TIME CONSUMING WHEEL TO GET YOUR ADDRESS IN 
THE GERMAN VEHICLE S INTERFACE AND CONTROLS AREN T INTUITIVE THE LEARNING CURVE OF UNDERSTANDING THE PATHS OR STEPS COULD BE LONG FOR THE CERTAIN PEOPLE 
THE GIANT WING ON THE GSR DECREASES VISIBILITY SLIGHTLY 
THE GLASS IN THE HATCH SHOULD BE 1 PIECE RATHER THAN SPLIT IN 2 THE ANGLED REAR WINDOWS SHOULD BE FLATTENED FOR BETTER VISIBILITY 
THE GLK S AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD EASY TO USE AND SOUNDS TERRIFIC THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS USEFUL AND WORKS WELL WHEN WE NEED TO RELY ON IT 
THE GMC TERRAIN IS A SOLID COMFORTABLE ATTRACTIVE VEHICLE SINCE I AM RATHER SHORT I HAVE SOME PROBLEM WITH VISIBILITY WHERE THE SIDE MIRRORS BLOCK SOME LATERAL VISION 
THE GOLF HAS A NASTY DRIVERS BLIND SPOT THIS IS COMPLICATED BY LARGE REAR HEADRESTS I WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE MINE AS I RARELY HAVE REAR PASSENGERS 
THE GOLF IS A VERY SAFE AND RESPONSIVE FEEL FROM START TO FINISH 
THE GOOGLE MAPS BASED NAVIGATION DISPLAY IS EXCELLENT 
THE GPS AND THE AUDIO PHONE
THE GPS CONTROL IS TOO HIGH THE COLUMNS ARE TOO WIDE
THE GPS COORDINATES ROUTE MAPPING DOES NOT WORK WELL FOR DIRT ROADS GOING FROM PAVED AREA TO A LOCATION ON A DIRT ROAD WORK OK BUT WHEN STARTING FROM A GPS LOCATION ON A DIRT ROAD THE NAV SYSTEM CANNOT GUIDE YOU TO ANOTHER GPS COORDINATION LOCA 
THE GPS DOESN T WORK AND HAS NEVER WORKED IT GIVES ME THE OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS 
THE GPS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO USE WITH WEIRD HABITS ZOOMING IN OR OUT UNEXPECTEDLY NOT WORKING WHILE I M DRIVING WHICH MEANS MY PASSENGER CAN T INPUT AN ADDRESS AND I CAN T INPUT ONE UNDER SAFE CONDITIONS EITHER AND ALSO MEANS I ALWAYS 
THE GPS IS NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SHOULD BE TOTALLY UP TO DATE ALSO HAD TROUBLE WITH IT NOT LOCATING AND HAD TO CALL AND THEY COULD FIND IT AND PUT THROUGH TO CAR SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT 
THE GPS IS PRACTICALLY UNUSABLE FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN SEEING THE SURROUNDING AREA 
THE GPS IS USEFUL AND THE KIDS LIKE TO WATCH THE MAP SO IT KEEPS THEM CONTENT 
THE GPS SOFTWARE NEEDS TO BE RE PROGRAMMED FROM SCRATCH TO IMPROVE SPEED USEFULNESS AND CLARITY 
THE GPS SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED THE LOCATION OF THE HOUSE SEARCHED FOR IS ABOUT 100 YDS PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL ONE MY LAST GARMAN WAS RIGHT ON WITH SUCH A LOCATION 
THE GRANDCHILDREN USE IT THE MOST 
THE GRAPHIC QUALITY OF THE MAPS IS SUBPAR IT WAS MUCH BETTER IN MY 2012 MURANO
THE GRAPHICS
THE GRAPHICS ARE NOT THAT GREAT I HAVE SEEN OTHER NAV SYSTEM IN OTHER CARS THAT ARE MUCH BETTER WHEN YOU TRY TO TYPE A POINT OF INTEREST IT WILL TRY TO GUESS THE LETTERS AND MOST OF THE TIME WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TYPE THE WHOLE NAME OF THE PLACE 
THE GRAPHICS COULD BE BETTER 
THE GRAPHICS COULD LOOK NICER THE INTERFACE COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE 
THE GRAPHICS LOOK OLD ORANGE WITH BLACK {{{ LOOKS LIKE AN OLD COMOPUTER SYSTEM WOULD LOVE TO HAVE CARPLAY BY APPLE
THE GRAPHICS ON THE ENTERTAINMENT SCREEN ARE AWFUL FOR A 2015 VEHICLE THE DOT PITCH IS UNACCEPTABLE AT THIS PRICE POINT PLUS NO APPS PANDORA YOU GET THESE APPS WITH VEHICLES COSTING MUCH LESS VERY DISAPPOINTED HERE 
THE GRAPHICS ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ARE SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSING IN A NEW 2015 VEHICLE 
THE GRAPHICS ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CAN BE VERY HARD TO READ VERY BUSY LOOKING ON THE SCREEN
THE GREAT SOUND 
THE GRILL NEEDS TO HAVE A HONEY CONE TO KEEP FROM HAVE BIRDS OR OTHER LARGE DEBRE FROM FLYING INTO THE GRILL AREA
THE GUI SEEMS A LITTLE OUTDATED 
THE HAND WRITING RECOGNITION IS FANTASTIC AS IT KEEPS ME FOCUSSED ON THE ROAD SITTING UP RIGHT THAN FONDLING WITH A TOUCH SCREEN OR A NAV FOB
THE HANDLING AND STEERING OF THE CAR IS GREATE 
THE HANDLING IS SECOND TO NONE IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE MANEUVER YOU DON T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RECOVERING FROM THE MANEUVER MANY ACCIDENTS ARE CAUSED BY THE INITIAL AVOIDANCE MANEUVER FOLLOWED BY AN INABILITY TO RECOVER CONTROL 
THE HANDLING WHILE DRIVING IS OUTSTANDING HOWEVER VISIBILITY IS LACKING WHEN CHANGING LANES AND PARKING IF IT WASN T FOR THE CAMERA I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REVERSE INTO A PARKING PLACE THE BLIND SPOT AND LANE DEPARTURE WARNING WOULD GREATLY 
THE HANDS FREE ACCESS TO MY PHONE IS A MOST WELCOME FEATURE
THE HANDS FREE AND THAT IT RECOGNIZES OUR VOICES MOST VOICE CONTROLS IE PERSONAL PHONE DO NOT UNDERSTAND MY VOICE WELL 
THE HANDS FREE ASPECT WORKS PERFECTLY 
THE HANDS FREE BLUE TOOTH
THE HANDS FREE BLUE TOOTH PHONE SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE
THE HANDS FREE BLUE TOOTH TELEPHONE SYSTEM 
THE HANDS FREE BLUETHTOOTH SYSTEM IN THIS VEHICLE IS A DISTRACTION TO SAY THE LEAST!
THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH CALLING QUALITY IS ATROCIOUS NO ONE CAN HEAR ME ALSO THE STOCK SOUND SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO VOICE YOU CANNOT HEAR CLEARWAY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS WITH THE VOUME ON MAXIMUM 
THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH PHONE CAPABILITY IS MY FAVORITE 
THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT ITS HARD TO HEAR THE CALLER I HAVE TO SHOUT FOR THE CALLER TO HEAR ME MOST OF THE TIME WHAT I SAY IS UNCLEAR I HAVE STOPPED USING THE BLUETOOTH DEVICE
THE HANDS FREE CALLING 
THE HANDS FREE CALLING AND THE XM RADIO ARE MY FAVORITE FEATURES

THE HANDS FREE CAPABILITIES AND VOICE RECOGNITION ARE GREAT ALLOW YOU TO FOCUS ON ROAD 
THE HANDS FREE CAPABILITY
THE HANDS FREE CAPABILITY IS REALLY GREAT WHEN TRAVELING THROUGH MULTIPLE STATES THAT MIGHT REQUIRE HANDS FREE OR NOT I DON T WORRY SINCE I HAVE THE FORD SYNCH
THE HANDS FREE CAPABILITY OFFERED BY THE VEHICLE 
THE HANDS FREE CELL PHONE USE IS GREAT I CAN HEAR AND OTHERS CAN HEAR ME 
THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION 
THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION IS NOT GREAT I AM CONSTANTLY HAVING TO REPEAT MYSELF AND IT DOES NOT CONNECT TO MY CALLS RIGHT AWAY I HAVE TO SAY HELLO MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END HEARS ME 
THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION IS SLOPPY HALF THE WORDS OR SONGS IT GETS WRONG ALWAYS TRYING TO CALL WHEN I AS FOR A SONG TO BE PLAYED 
THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATIONS
THE HANDS FREE CONNECTION FOR THE PHONE IS UNUSABLE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS THE QUALITY OF THE OTHER CALLER IS ADEQUATE BUT THEY CANNOT UNDERSTAND ME PERHAPS THE SYSTEM NEEDS A BETTER MIC?
THE HANDS FREE CONNECTIVITY TO THE CELL PHONE WAS EASY TO SET UP IT IS EASY TO USE WHEN DRIVING AND IT HAS BEEN TERRIFIC SIMPLY PUT THE SYNC FEATURE IS TERRIFIC 
THE HANDS FREE DEVICE FOR PHONE IS VERY SAFE WHILE DRIVING THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS AWESOME AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS NEVER LET ME DOWN 
THE HANDS FREE DEVICE WAS NEVER INSTALLED AND I HAVE YET TO READ THE MANUAL TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT
THE HANDS FREE EXPERIENCE MAKES IT EASY TO CHANGE CHANNELS AND LISTEN TO WHAT I WANT
THE HANDS FREE LINK WITH MY PHONE!
THE HANDS FREE OPERATION 
THE HANDS FREE OPTION IS A JOKE A IT BARELY UNDERSTANDS MY VERY AMERICAN ACCENT MORE IMPORTANTLY EACH COMMAND REQUIRES THE USER TO PRESS THE VOICE BUTTON OFTEN MULTIPLE TIMES TO USE THE HANDS FREE NAVIGATION I NEED TO PRESS A BUTTON OVE 
THE HANDS FREE OPTION IT S AWESOME!
THE HANDS FREE OPTION WAS CONFUSING TO ME AT FIRST SO I JUST STOPPED TRYING I M SURE IT S NOT THAT HARD THOUGH 
THE HANDS FREE PHONE
THE HANDS FREE PHONE 
THE HANDS FREE PHONE AND ENTERTAINMENT CONTROLS
THE HANDS FREE PHONE APPLICATION
THE HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS AND THAT IT READS MY TEXT MESSAGES

THE HANDS FREE PHONE FEATURE PICKS UP MY WIFES VOICE VERY WELL AND NO ONE HAS COMPLAINED THAT THEY CAN T HEAR HER OR MADE THE COMMENT THAT SHE MUST BE IN THE CAR WHAT A CHANGE FROM OUR GMC PRODUCT THAT WE HAD 
THE HANDS FREE PHONE I CAN MAKE CALLS WHILE I M DRIVING BY USING THE VOICE COMMANDS AS WELL AS ACCEPT CALLS WITHOUT SEARCHING FOR MY PHONE 
THE HANDS FREE PHONE IS EASY FOR ME TO USE BUT A LITTLE HARD FOR THE CALLER TO UNDERSTAND AT TIMES I SWITCH TO MY PHONE FOR SOME CALLERS 
THE HANDS FREE PHONE IS HARD TO PICK UP CALLS
THE HANDS FREE PHONE IS LIKE TALKING WITH A PASSENGER
THE HANDS FREE PHONE IS MY FAVORITE AND ALSO PROVIDES SAFETY AT ALL TIMES 
THE HANDS FREE PHONE IS VERY CLEAR AND CONVENIENT
THE HANDS FREE PHONE OFFERS SAFETY AND IS EASY TO USE 
THE HANDS FREE PHONE SYSTEM
THE HANDS FREE PHONE SYSTEM IS BY FAR THE BEST YOU CAN HEAR AND BE HEARD BETTER WHEN USING IT THAN WHEN USING ONLY THE PHONE EITHER NORMALLY OR ON SPEAKER PHONE 
THE HANDS FREE SPEAKER SYSTEM IS NOT VIABLE OVER 50MPH THE MICROPHONE PICKS UP WAY TO MUCH ROAD/WIND NOISE MAKING IT NEARLY UNUSABLE THE IPHONE CONTROLS NEED TO BE MORE INTUITIVE BUT OVER ALL I ENJOY THE SYSTEM 
THE HANDS FREE SYSTEM HAS A HARD TIME RECOGNIZING VOICE COMMANDS AND DOESN T SYNC UP WITH MY PHONE VERY WELL OR AT ALL 
THE HANDS FREE SYSTEM USING MY CELL PHONE AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WORKS GREAT 
THE HANDS FREE TALKING FOR SAFETY 
THE HANDS FREE TELEPHONE FEATURE IS VERY EASY TO USE AND THE SOUND QUALITY OF PHONE CALLS IS EXCELLENT 
THE HANDS FREE TELEPHONE HAS VERY POOR CLARITY 
THE HANDS FREE VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN MAKING PHONE CALLS 
THE HANDS FREE VOLUME CONTROL NEEDS TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO TOUCH 
THE HANDS FREE WORKS FANTASTIC THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE AND ALWAYS CHOOSES THE LONGEST ROUTE 
THE HANDSFREE
THE HANDSFREE LINK ISN T GOOD I WOULD RATHER IT LET ME BETTER USE SIRI AS THE PHONE S RECONGNITION IS BETTER
THE HANDSFREE TO PRIVATE CALL SEEMS TO SWITCH BACK AND FORTH WITHOUT APPARENT REASON THE DEFAULT SHOULD BE THE BLUETOOTH TO THE CAR I HAVE TO TOGGLE THE SPEAKER ON MY IPHONE TO GET IT TO SWITCH FROM HANDSET TO CAR 
THE HARD DRIVE FEATURE IS GREAT 
THE HARDEST IS PART IS THAT THE HANDS FREE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY 
THE HARMAN KARDON SOUND SYSTEM MAKES ALL TRAFFIC JAMS LESS STRESSFUL LOVE THE SUBWOOFER 
THE HARMAN KARDON SOUNDS SYSTEM IS BEYOND EXCEPTIONAL THAT ADDED WITH THE NEW U CONNECT AND 8 4 TOUCH SCREEN MAKES THIS THE BEST SYSTEM I HAVE EVER SEEN
THE HARMAN KARDON SYSTEM SOUNDS UNBELIEVABLE I DONT REALLY USE THE FANCY VOICE FEATURES BUT I KNOW THEY ARE THERE I DONT WANT TO PAY MONTHLY FEES FOR CAR INTERNET OR SATELLITE RADIO SO I DONT NEED THOSE 
THE HARMON KARDMAN SPEAKER SOUND SYSTEM IS FANTASTIC MY LAST CAR HAD BOSE THIS BLOWS IT OUT OF THE WATER!
THE HARMON KARDON AUDIO SYSTEM SOUNDS GREAT AND HAS GREAT RANGE AND CLARITY EVEN WHEN AT SPEED ON THE HIGHWAY 
THE HARMON KARDON SOUND IS EXCEPTIONSL
THE HARMON KARDON SOUND SYSTEM IS GREAT THE SPEAKERS ARE EXCELLENT LOVE THAT I CAN CONTROL MOST EVERYTHING FROM THE ROUND CONTROL IN THE CENTER CONSOLE THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE USB CONNECTION IN THE MERCEDES DOES NOT WORK WITH APPLE IPH 
THE HARMON KARDON SOUND SYSTEM IS GREAT WOULD LIKE A BLUETOOTH CONNECTION RATHER THAN HAVING TO USE A USB PORT 
THE HARMON KARDON SOUND SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE BEST SOUND SYSTEMS THAT I VE EVER HEARD IN A CAR 
THE HARMON KARDON SPEAKERS ARE VERY GOOD BUT I VE HEARD BETTER 
THE HARMON KARDON SPEAKERS NEED TO BE IMPROVED
THE HARMON KARDON SPEAKERS SOUND TINNY
THE HARMON KARDON SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT!
THE HARMON KARDON SYSTEM!
THE HARMON KARDON UPGRADE IS WORTH IT
THE HARMON KARMAN SOUND SYSTEM IS GREAT 
THE HARMON SYSTEM IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS EXPECTED 
THE HASSLE FROM SIRIUS TO BUY THEIR PROGRAMING!
THE HATCH SPOILER MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOW BUT I WOULDN T WANT TO LOSE THE FEATURE 
THE HAZARD SIGNAL IS TOO SENSITIVE AND IS RIGHT BY THE BUTTONS THAT ARE REGULARLY USED 
THE HD BACK UP CAMERA IS TERRIFIC
THE HD CHANNELS SEEM TO FADE IN AND OUT WHILE LISTENING NOT SURE WHAT TO ATTRIBUTE THAT TO 
THE HD FEATURES ON THE RADIO 
THE HD FM TUNES IN AND OUT OFTEN NOT SURE IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF BOOST FOR THE HD RADIO 
THE HD MIRRORS ARE HARD TO SEE AROUND BUT I WOULDN T CHANGE THEM AT ALL
THE HD RADIO COMPLETELY GOES OUT IN A LOT OF AREAS WHEN I HAVE IT ON I FIND IT TO BE COMPLETELY ANNOYING 
THE HD RADIO DOES NOT ALWAYS CONNECT IT IS KIND OF ANNOYING WHEN THE HD DOES NOT CONNECT BECAUSE IT STUTTERS THE MUSIC WHEN IT IS TRYING TO CONNECT 
THE HD RADIO I WAS TOLD AT THE DEALERSHIP MY ISSUE IS A DESIGN FLAW I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS OTHERS I KNOW THAT HAVE AN X1 DO NOT HAVE THE ISSUE I AM HAVING 
THE HD RADIO SEEMS TO FADE IN AND OUT AT TIMES I WOULD HAVE LIKED THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY BUT DIDN T WANT TO PAY THE UPCHARGE FOR IT WISH IT CAME STANDARD AT THIS POINT 
THE HEAD LIGHTS ARE GREAT I CAN SEE AT NIGHT SO MUCH BETTER THAN IN MY PREVIOUS CAR 
THE HEAD LIGHTS ARE NOT THE BEST MY TRUCK WAS HARD TO FIND AS IT IS A MANUAL THE DEALER SHIP FOUND IT IN PENNSYLVANIA AND HAD IT SHIPPED TO OHIO I WISH IT CAME WITH FOG LIGHTS OR THE OPTION TO INSTALL THEM LATER LIKE MY OTHER RAMS THE ALL CAME WIT 
THE HEAD LIGHTS ARE TERRIBLE OUR TOYOTA COROLLA HAS BETTER NIGHT VISIBILITY THAN OUR DID I SAY EXPENSIVE PICKUP TRUCK DEALERSHIP SAYS NOTHING WE CAN DO AS THIS TIME 
THE HEAD LIGHTS COULD BE BETTER
THE HEAD LIGHTS COULD HAVE DAYLIGHT RUNNING LIGHT FOR MORE SAFTY
THE HEAD LIGHTS DO AN AWESOME JOB ALMOST TOO GOOD AS SOME DRIVERS FEEL I HAVE ON THE BRIGHT LIGHTS WHEN THEY ARE NOT ENGAGED 
THE HEAD REST BLOCK REAR VISIBILITY IN SOME DIRECTIONS 
THE HEAD REST FOR THE 3RD ROW SEATING CAN BLOCK VISIBILITY WHEN IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION 
THE HEAD REST ON THE 2ND ROW SEAT ON PASSENGER SIDE MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW ON THE PASSENGER SIDE IT BLOCKS THE VISION TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS COMING 
THE HEAD REST SEEM TO BE TO HIGH WHEN YOU WANT TO BACK UP
THE HEAD RESTS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE WHICH BLOCKS THE VIEW OF THE BACK WINDOW AND OFTEN TIMES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT S SAFE TO SWITCH LANES THEY ARE SO TALL IT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER IN AND OUT OF TRAFFIC SAFELY 
THE HEAD RESTS ARE SO HIGH THAT THEY TEND TO BE A DISTRACTION IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THE HEAD RESTS ARE TOO TALL FOR THE SPACE THE HEAD RESTS SHOULD BE RECTANGULAR SO THE DRIVER CAN SEE OVER THEM 
THE HEAD RESTS BLOCK SOME VISIBILITY PARTICULARLY WHEN EASING INTO TRAFFIC 
THE HEAD RESTS GET IN THE WAY WHEN LOOKING BACK AND BACKING UP OTHER THAN THAT VISIBILITY IS GOOD 
THE HEAD RESTS IN THE BACK SEAT BLOCK SOME OF THE VISIBILITY TO THE REAR 
THE HEAD RESTS IN THE BACK SEAT MAKE IT HARD TO SEE CLEARLY WHEN TRYING TO LOOK BACK TO CHANGE LANES I TOOK THE REAR HEAD RESTS OUT BUT HAVE THEM IN THE CAR IN THE EVENT OF SOMEONE RIDING IN THE BACK
THE HEAD RESTS MAKE LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER DIFFICULT TO SEE PROPERLY
THE HEAD RESTS ON BACK SEATS ARE TOO HIGH THEY TEND TO ALLOW GOOD VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW 
THE HEAD RESTS ON REAR SEATS BLOCK VISIBILITY
THE HEAD RESTS ON THE BACK SEAT BLOCK A LOT OF VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING OUT THE SIDES 
THE HEAD RESTS ON THE BACK SEATS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW WHEN SITTING IN THE DRIVER SEAT 
THE HEAD RESTS ON THE PASSENGER SEATS IN THE BACK REALLY NEGATE MOST OF THE VISIBITY WITH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THE HEAD RESTS ON THE SECOND ROW SEATS OBSTRUCT THE VIEW IN PARKING OUT OF A DIAGONAL PARKING SPOT THE CAMERA HELPS SOME BUT IT STILL IS ANNOYING NOT TO SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE
THE HEAD RESTS ON THE THIRD SEATS LIMIT REAR VISIBILITY
THE HEAD ROOM AND LEG ROOM ARE OUTSTANDING!
THE HEAD UNIT AND SPEAKERS ARE MATCHED VERY WELL!
THE HEAD UNIT CONTROLS ARE TOO SMALL 
THE HEAD UNIT COULD HAVE BEEN OF BETTER QUALITY I THINK ITS JUST A VERY CHEAP STOCK HEAD UNIT ON THE BASE MODEL WRX BEING CHEAP THE SOUND QUALITY AND SIGNAL QUALITY IS POOR WHICH IS NO PROBLEM REALLY BECAUSE THEY RE EASILY REPLACEABLE WITH AFTE 
THE HEAD UNIT IS SO TERRIBLE I REPLACED IT WITH A PIONEER UNIT 
THE HEAD UNIT NEEDS MASSIVE IMPROVEMENTS IT LOOKS OUT DATED AND CAN BE A LITTLE SLOW HAS A LOT OF BUGS AND KEEPS WANTING TO SWITCH OUT OF NO WHERE TO PRESET 1 IN THE LIST WITH THE COMMANDER KNOB NO DEFAULT SATELLITE RADIO?? BIG NEGATIVE AND NO 
THE HEADLAMPS ARE AMAZING
THE HEADLAMPS ARE AWFUL AND A HAZARD THEY ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH! ALSO FOR A TOP OF THE LINE DENALI THEY SHOULD HAVE BLIND SIDE WARNING DETECTION 
THE HEADLAMPS COULD BE IMPROVED 
THE HEADLAMPS WORK EXCEPTIONALLY WELL BUT PERHAPS THEY WORK A LITTLE TOO WELL THE HIGH BEAMS LIGHT UP A SIGNIFIGANT PORTION OF THE ROAD AHEAD BUT THE REFLECTION FROM ROAD SIGNS CAN DAZZLE ME THERE IS ALSO A BLIND SPOT CREATED BY THE B PILL 
THE HEADLIGHT ADJUSTMENT FROM THE DASH IS GREAT ON DARK OR FOGGY ROADS WHEN HIGH BEAMS ARE TOO BRIGHT 
THE HEADLIGHT SYSTEM IS UTTERLY PHENOMENAL!
THE HEADLIGHT SYSTEMS AND TAIL LIGHTS ON THE VEHICLE ARE VERY GOOD VERY VISIBLE IN MORNING AND EVENING CONDITIONS 
THE HEADLIGHTS AGAIN NEED TO BE UPDATED IT IS SO HARD TO SEE AT NIGHT WITH THESE LIGHTS!
THE HEADLIGHTS AND BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE AMAZING 
THE HEADLIGHTS AND DAYTIME DRIVING LIGHTS ARE OUTSTANDING 
THE HEADLIGHTS AND TAILLIGHTS ARE BOTH VERY EFFECTIVE AND ATTRACTIVE 
THE HEADLIGHTS APPEAR TO HIT A WALL AND STOP WHEN YOU HIT A DIP AND THE LIGHTS FACE DOWN DUE TO THAT YOU HAVE NO LIGHTS TO THE FRONT ALSO THE AUTO HEADLAMPS SOMETIMES DOES NOT CHANGE WHEN GOING AROUND A CURVE OR PICK UP AN ONCOMING CAR AND LEA 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE A LITTLE DIM SO AT NIGHT IT IS HARD TO SEE IF THE HIGH BEAMS ARE NOT ON OTHERWISE I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE IN MY CAR 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE A LITTLE LOW AND DIM
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ABSOLUTELY CRAP I OWNED A MAZDA 3 AND THOSE HEADLIGHTS WERE FAR SUPERIOR THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ALSO SUCK THEY SHOULD BE USING A SINGLE BLADE LIKE BOSCH ICON RATHER THAN THE 1980 S STYLE WIPER FURTHERMORE THE DOOR MIRRORS SH 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE AMAZING
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE AMAZING 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE AMAZINGLY BRIGHT!! I RARELY EVEN NEED MY BRIGHTS IN SITUATIONS WHERE I WOULD HAVE USED THEM IN OTHER VEHICLES 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE AWESOME
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE BRIGHT AND COOL LOOKING 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE BRIGHT BUT THE OVERALL BEAM SHINES IN TOO SMALL AN AREA DEPENDING ON WHERE THE DRIVER SEAT IS SET IT FEELS LIKE DUCKING TO SEE BELOW THE BEAMS HORIZON LINE WHEN TURNING A LEFT CORNER THE DRIVER VISIBLILTY ON THE LEFT IS ALIGNE 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE DIFFERENT THEY LIKE CUT OFF ON DIM MAYBE DESIGNED NOT TO BLIND ON COMING TRAFFIC NOT SURE BUT DIFFERENT THEN ANY OTHER AUTO OWNED
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ESPECIALLY EXCEPTIONAL
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE EXTREMELY UNDERPOWERED COMPARED TO THE PROJECTOR HEADLIGHTS OF OTHER BRANDS

THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH EVEN WHEN USING THE BRIGHTS THE LIGHT DOES NOT REACH OUT FAR ENOUGH 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH!
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT GREAT WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT NEARLY AS EFFECTIVE AS I HAD HOPED THEY WOULD BE THEY SEEM A BIT DIM 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT VERY BRIGHT AT NIGHT
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON 24/7 WHEN THE CAR IS ON BUT THEY SWITCH TO THE APPROPRIATE LIGHT COLOR DEPENDING ON DAY OR NIGHT THE FRONT LIGHTS HAVE LED LIGHTS THAT TURN WHEN YOU TURN AND PREDICT WHERE YOU ARE GOING BY THE STEERING WHEEL 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE OUTSTANDING I FREQUENTLY DRIVE ON NARROW MOUNTAIN ROADS AND THE ADAPTIVE HEADLIGHTS GIVE ME EXCELLENT NIGHTTIME VISIBILITY THE AUTO DIMMING FEATURE THAT SWITCHES FROM BRIGHT TO DIM WHEN A VEHICLE APPROACHES IS EXCELLENT 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE OUTSTANDING! I HAVE A CORNEA PROBLEM WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE AT NIGHT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DRIVING THIS VAN COMPARED TO OUR OLD VEHICLE IS AMAZING! IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND I FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING AT NIGHT 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE POWERFUL BUT ANGLE DOWN SLIGHTLY MORE THAN THEY NEED TO 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE REALLY BRIGHT I CAN SEE SO CLEAR RARLEY HAVE TO USE HIGH BEAMS!
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE SUFFICIENT EVEN WHEN SELECTED TO PARKING LIGHTS SO AT HIGH BEAMS THEY ARE TRULY EXCEPTIONAL THE REAR WINDOW IS VERY SMALL AND HAVING ELEVATED HEADRESTS MAKE THE REAR VIEW EVEN MORE POOR THE REAR WIPERS MOUNT IS POORLY POSITIO 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE SURPRISINGLY POOR WHEN YOU TURN CORNERS THEY DO VERY LITTLE TO ILLUMINATE WHERE YOU RE TURNING 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE THE BEST I VE EVER EXPERIENCED
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE TOO BRIGHT 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY BRIGHT AND I CAN SEE ALL AROUND ME WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY CLEAR AND DIRECT HOWEVER GOING UP OR DOWN A HILL AT NIGHT GIVES THE APPEARANCE OF 1/2 THE WINDSHIELD NOT IN THE LIGHT IN TOTAL DARKNESS AND I AM CONSTINTLY LOOKING DOWN INTO THE BOTTOM 1/2 OF THE WINDWHEILD TO SEE THE 
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY DIM I WILL PROBABLY PURCHASE AFTERMARKET BULBS
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY DISAPPOINTING THE CONVENTIONAL LIGHTS ON MY 2014 PROVIDED BETTER VISIBILITY
THE HEADLIGHTS CAN BE A BRIGHTER
THE HEADLIGHTS COULD BE A BIT BRIGHTER AND THE WIPER BLADES ARE OK AT BEST THE SUN VISORS COULD USE A SLIGHT REDESIGN TO BLOCK THE SUN BETTER 
THE HEADLIGHTS COULD BE BRIGHTER THAN THEY ARE AT NIGHT THEY DO NOT THROW OUT ENOUGH LIGHT ON DIMLY LIT OR COUNTRY ROADS 
THE HEADLIGHTS DO A GOOD JOB FROM THE SENSE OF A WIDE ANGLE BUT IF ITS REALLY DARK OUTSIDE AND NO STREET LIGHTING ITS HARD TO SEE GOING UP AND DOWN HILLS OR MAKING TURNS THE LIGHTS ARE NOT ADEQUATE
THE HEADLIGHTS DO NOT HAVE A HIGH BLOOM EFFECT THERE IS A DEFINED LINE WHERE YOU CAN SEE VERY WELL AND WHERE YOU CANNOT 
THE HEADLIGHTS DO NOT ILLUMINATE JUST IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE I HAVE TO ALWAYS DRIVE WITH THE FOG LIGHTS ON IN ADDITION TO THE HEADLIGHTS TO SEE ASPECTS OF THE ROAD THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE FRONT END CURBS ETC 
THE HEADLIGHTS DO NOT ILLUMINATE WELL VERTICALLY ON A LEVEL SURFACE TOP OF THE LIGHT BEAM IS TOO LOW AND MAKES LOOKING WELL AHEAD OF THE VEHICLE VERY DIFFICULT WHILE IT HAS A NICE WIDE ILLUMINATION RANGE THE FACT THAT IT IS QUITE LOW MAKES 
THE HEADLIGHTS DO NOT SEEM TO SHINE AS FAR DOWN THE ROAD AS THEY OUGHT TO THEY SHOULD BE EITHER BRIGHTER OR AIMED FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD 
THE HEADLIGHTS DO NOT SHINE FOR FAR DISTANCE HOWEVER WHERE THEY DO SHINE IS VERY CLEAR AND BRIGHT 
THE HEADLIGHTS DON T SEEM TO ILLUMINATE AS WELL AS I FEEL THEY SHOULD AND THE SIDE PANELS FOR THE FRONT GLASS CREATE A BLIND SPOT 
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE A GREAT DESIGN BECAUSE THEY FAN OUT TO THE SIDES THE HEADLIGHTS ON LOW BRIGHTNESS ARE OK BUT THE BRIGHT SETTING IS AMAZING THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS CAN TAKE A LITTLE GETTING USED TO 
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE A LOW TOP TO ILLUMINATION RIDING ON HILLY CURVY ROADS AT NIGHT IS A CAUSE OF CONCERN
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE A SHORT OR SMALL HORIZONTAL ILLUMINATION ZONE ON REGULAR INCREASES THE HEIGHT OF VISIBILITY ON HIGH BEAM 
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE AN APPARENT CUTOFF IN THEIR HEIGHT NON BRIGHT SETTING MAKING IT A BIT UNNERVING DRIVING DOWN A HILL/DECLINE WITH LITTLE VISIBILITY AHEAD OF ME
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE AN UPPER CUTOFF THAT IS SO LOW THAT A SMALL HIGH SPOT IN THE ROAD BLOCKS THE ENTIRE LIGHT AND I CAN T SEE BEYOND THE HIGH SPOT 
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE GREAT DISTANCE
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE RAINBOW LIGHTS AND I DON T KNOW IF THIS IS A FACTORY DEFECT OR NOT I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS WITH MY OTHER CARS SUN VISORS ARE VERY SMALL AND CANNOT BE USEFULL FOR SHORT PERSON EVEN WHEN THE SEAT IN LEFTED 
THE HEADLIGHTS HIGH BEAMS ARE NOT MUCH BRIGHTER THAN THE NORMAL HEADLIGHTS
THE HEADLIGHTS IN THIS VEHICLE MAKE ALL OTHERS SEEM ANTIQUATED IN COMPARISON 
THE HEADLIGHTS IS REALLY NOTICEABLY JUST AVERAGE COMPARED TO OTHER CARS I HAVE DRIVEN BMW S HAVE ZENON LIGHTS THAT REALLY LIGHT UP THE ROAD SO WELL THE HEADLIGHTS ARE JUST ORDINARY AND JUST LIGHTS A SHORT WAY IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE AND I CAN T 
THE HEADLIGHTS LED I BELIEVE HAVE A VERY DEFINITE RANGE OF ILLUMINATION ALMOST LIKE A RECTANGLE WHEN DRIVING IN AN UNLIT AREA AT NIGHT MAKES SEEING DOWN THE ROAD DIFFICULT AND DON T FEEL I WOULD HAVE A VISUAL WARNING OF SOMETHING COMING DOWN 
THE HEADLIGHTS NEED TO BE TURNED ON MANUALLY WE HAVE FOUND OURSELVES DRIVING WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS ON AS ALL OF OUR PREVIOUS VEHICLES HAVE HAD AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS 
THE HEADLIGHTS NEED TO COME ON WHEN THE WIPERS COME ON IL STATE LAW
THE HEADLIGHTS NEED TO MORE OF A WHITE COLOR AND NOT A YELLOW COLOR 
THE HEADLIGHTS ON HIGH CONSTANTLY WHILE DRIVING SEEMS TO WORK ONLY SPORADICALLY IT MUST BE VERY VERY DARK BEFORE THE HIGHS KICK IN I DON T LIKE NOT HAVING MANUAL CONTROL OF ENGAGING THE HIGH LIGHTS TO LOW AND BACK AND FORTH 
THE HEADLIGHTS ON THIS MODEL DON T AUTOMATICALLY TURN ON AND OFF WHICH I MISS FROM THE PREVIOUS MODELS 
THE HEADLIGHTS PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY DURING NIGHTTIME DRIVING 
THE HEADLIGHTS SEEM TO HAVE A HORIZON WHICH IS DISTRACTING AT TIMES 
THE HEADLIGHTS SEEM TO STOP AT EYE LEVEL NOTHING ABOVE THAT LINE THE BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS OBSTRUCT THE VIEW WHILE DRIVING THEY AREN T ADJUSTABLE CAN T FOLD THEM BACK OUT OF THE WAY I HAD TO REMOVE THEM WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT IF THEY CO 
THE HEADLIGHTS SEEM TOO DIM 
THE HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE BRIGHTER I SOMETIMES AM UNSURE THAT THEY ARE ON 
THE HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE HID THEY ARE NOT AS BRIGHT AS I WOULD EXPECT THEM TO BE
THE HEADLIGHTS TURN WITH THE STEERING WHEEL PROVIDING A LIGHTED PATH AT ALL TIMES 
THE HEADLIGHTS WERE A MOST PLEASANT SURPRISE BOTH POWER AND TIE TO STEERING WE LIVE IN THE HILLS AND FORESTS OF MAINE DRIVING AT NIGH IS NOW A PLEASURE THANKS TO THE SUPERB LIGHTING SYSTEM 
THE HEADLIGHTS WHEN USED AT NIGHT SEEM TO BE AIMED VERY LOW ON THE STREET IT HAS TAKEN SOME GETTING USED TO WHEN DRIVING ON POORLY LIGHTED STREETS AT NIGHT 
THE HEADLIGHTS WITH THE TURN FEATURE IMPROVES VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING
THE HEADLIGHTS WON T COME ON AUTOMATICALLY WITH RAINY/SNOWY WEATHER AS THE 2013 DID ALSO THE SUN VISORS DO HAVE EXTENDERS ON THEM HOWEVER THE ROOF INTERFERES WITH BEING ABLE TO EXTEND THEM WHEN THE SUN VISOR IS OPENED COMPLETELY IN ORDER TO USE 
THE HEADLIGHTS WORK GREAT BUT ONLY WHEN I REMEMBER TO TURN THEM ON SINCE THE DASH IS SO BRIGHT I OFTEN FORGET TO TURN ON THE HEADLIGHTS BECAUSE MY MIND IS TRICKED INTO THINKING THEY ARE ALREADY ON BECAUSE ON A TRADITIONAL VEHICLE THE DASH IS 
THE HEADLIGHTS WOULD BE A 10 EXCEPT FOR THE CUTOFF WITH THE LED HEADLIGHTS AND THE POSSIBLE SAFETY CONCERNS THAT COULD RESULT FROM SIGNS NOT BEING ILLUMINATED BY HEADLIGHTS THAT SAID EVEN WITH THE CUTOFF THEY ARE STILL AWESOME AND I ABSOLUTELY 
THE HEADLIGHTS WOULD EVEN BE BETTER IF THEY HAD ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGY LIKE SOME CARS IN THIS CLASS AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY MY MODEL 3 8 DOES NOT HAVE THE OPTION FOR FOG LIGHTS IT ALLOWS FOR ALL WHEEL DRIVE BUT NOT FOG LIGHTS 
THE HEADPHONES PROVIDED STINK
THE HEADREST IN BACKSEAT BLOCKS YOUR VIEW WHEN BACKING OUT PASSENGER SIDE OTHERWISE NO PROBLEMS 
THE HEADREST MAKE IT A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW BUT I M NOT SURE HOW YOU COULD MAKE IT EASIER I RELY ON THE LIGHTS ON MY MIRRORS WHEN CHANGING LANES BECAUSE IT S NOT SO EASY TO TURN YOUR HEAD AND SEE CARS NEXT TO YOU ON THE HIGH 
THE HEADREST ON THE BACKSEATS SEEM TO BLACK SOME VISUAL ASPECTS WHEN TURNING TO LOOK
THE HEADREST ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT BLOCK VISIBILITY ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR TRAFFIC 
THE HEADREST ON THE NON STOW N GO SECOND ROW SEAT SHOULD BE ADJUSTABLE I CURRENTLY STICKS UP TOO HIGH AND IMPACTS VISIBILITY OUT OF THE REA OF THE VEHICLE WHEN USING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THE HEADRESTS ARE A BLIND SPOT FOR ME
THE HEADRESTS BLOCK MUCH OF AN ALREADY SMALL REAR WINDSHIELD I OFTEN PUT THE SEATS DOWN TO IMPROVE VISIBILITY ALTERNATIVELY ONE COULD MAKE THE HEADRESTS ADJUSTABLE SO THAT THEY FALL FORWARD WHEN NOT IN USE AND ALSO CONSIDER ALWAYS MAKING THE M 
THE HEADRESTS BLOCK THE DRIVER S VIEW TO THE RIGHT AND REAR 
THE HEADRESTS BLOCK THE REAR VIEW
THE HEADRESTS FRONT AND BACK ARE VERY TALL AND MAKE SEEING AROUND THEM DIFFICULT 
THE HEADRESTS IN THE REAR SEAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE VISIBILITY FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE REAR WINDOW
THE HEADRESTS OF THE SECOND ROW SEATS BLOCK THE REAR VIEW MIRROR VISIBILITY 
THE HEADRESTS ON THE BEHIND THE DRIVER PASSENGER SEATS SOMEWHAT BLOCK THE DRIVER S VIEW IT IS NOT OPTIONAL TO TAKE THEM ON AND OFF BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE TO STORE THEM AND ARE SADDLED WITH THE ISSUE OF PUTTING THEM BACK ON SHOULD YOU HAVE PASSENG 
THE HEADRESTS ON THE REAR SEATS IMPEDE REAR VISIBILITY 
THE HEADRESTS THAT ARE ON THE BACK SEATS ARE VERY HIGH WHEN I LOOK THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I FEEL AS IF I AM LOOKING THROUGH A TUNNEL IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FEEL SAFE WHILE BACKING UP 
THE HEADS UP DISPLAY IS GREAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOWEVER WHEN WEARING SUNGLASSES 
THE HEADS UP DISPLAY IS REALLY CONVENIENT 
THE HEADS UP DISPLAY ON THE WINDSHIELD IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE HEADS UP PROJECTION OF VEHICLE S SPEED AND NAVIGATION ON THE WINDSHIELD SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT 
THE HEADSETS ON BOTH FRONT AND REAR SEATS ARE TOO HIGH AND WIDE WHICH BLOCKS VISION WHEN TRYING TO LOOK OUT OF REAR WINDOW 
THE HEAT/COOLING DISPLAY IS TOUCHSCREEN ONLY
THE HEATED FRONT WIPERS AREN T AS USEFUL AS I WOULD HAVE HOPED 
THE HEATING SYSTEM
THE HEIGHT OF THE PASSENGER HEAD REST MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHILE LOOKING TO THE REAR IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE THE HEAD REST FULLY EXTENDED TO AVOID HAVING A BLIND SPOT 
THE HEIGHT OF THE PASSENGER SEAT AND HEAD SUPPORT BLOCK THE VIEW WHEN LOOKING OUT THE SIDE FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC AT TIMES 
THE HEIGHT OF THE REAR SEATS SOMETIMES MAKES IT HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE
THE HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE MAKES FOR GREAT VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY FOR SHORT PEOPLE WHICH CERTAINLY ENHANCES THE SAFETY FACTOR 
THE HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE WORKS WELL FOR ME AT NIGHT IN A LOWER PROFILE VEHICLE I HAVE ISSUES WITH NIGHT GLARE FROM OTHER HEADLIGHTS IN THE CX 5 I HAVEN T ENCOUNTERED ANY ISSUES WITH NIGHT GLARE 
THE HEIGHT OF VEHICLE IS EASIER TO GET IN THAN THAT OF A SEDAN CAR HEIGHT
THE HEIGHT WIDTH OF THE REAR CORNER POST ARE TOO TALL AND THE SLOPE IS TOO GREAT WHEN DRIVING THE 04 PARK AVE I COULD GLANCE ABOUT 45 DEGREES LEFT OR RIGHT AND SEE ONCOMING TRAFFIC ON THE REAR QUARTER BUT NOT IN THIS CAR I HAVE NOT GOTTEN 
THE HID HEADLIGHTS AND LED TAILIGHTS
THE HID HEADLIGHTS AND THE WIDE ANGLE ARE LIKE DAYTIME VISION LOVE LOVE
THE HID HEADLIGHTS PROVIDE EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AT NIGHT 
THE HID SWIVELING HEADLIGHTS ARE AWESOME!
THE HIDDEN CD PLAYER ON THE NAV SYSTEM IS NICE 
THE HIGH BEAM IS WEAK AND INEFFECTIVE COMPARED TO OTHER CARS 
THE HIGH BEAMS ARE EXCEPTIONAL THE LANE CHANGE WARNING INDICATORS ARE TOO SENSITIVE 
THE HIGH BEAMS ARE FOCUSED TO HIGH DOWN THE ROAD THE REFLECTION FROM ROAD SIDE SIGNS IS SO BAD THAT I CHOOSE TO DRIVE USING LOW BEAMS 
THE HIGH BEAMS ILLUMINATE A NICE HEMISPHERE IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE IT S LITERALLY A HALF DOME OFF IN THE DISTANCE 
THE HIGH HEADRESTS IN THE BACK PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTER SEAT MAKE REAR VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT LIMITED 
THE HIGH HOOD MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PULL INTO UP HILL PARKING GARAGES OR SPACES THANK YOU 
THE HIGH NUMBER OF AIRBAGS IN THIS SIZE/PRICE CATEGORY IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE HIGH QUALITY SOUND
THE HIGH REAR TRUCK PROFILE THE HIGH HEAD RESTS AND SMALLER SIDE AND REAR WINDOWS THICKER ROOF SUPPORTS MAKE ALL AROUND VISIBILITY A MAJOR PROBLEM BUICK IS NOT ALONE IN THIS REGARD 
THE HIGH SAFETY RATING OF THIS CAR WAS IMPORTANT TO OUR DECISION TO BUY 
THE HIGH SEATING IS GREAT FOR SEEING OUT OF THE VEHICLE 
THE HIGH SEATING POSITION GREATLY IMPROVES VISIBILITY
THE HIGH SMALL SIDE WINDOWS AND FRONT SIDE AIRBAGS REDUCE VISIBILITY 
THE HIGH TECH SAFETY FEATURES ARE WONDERFUL KEEP MY FAMILY SAFE AND HAS IMPROVED MY SAFE DRIVING 
THE HIGHT RIDE AND HANDLING
THE HK SOUND SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS SUPERIOR TO OTHERS I HAVE USED NO ONE COMPLAINS ON THE OTHER END AND THEY ALL MAKE COMMENTS OF HOW CLEAR I SOUND EVEN ON THE HIGHWAY LOVE
THE HMI COULD BE SIMPLER & CLEANER EASIER TO VIEW AT A GLANCE HAVE NEVER FIGURED OUT HOW TO ORGANIZE THE HARD DRIVE UPLOAD MUSIC INTO ALBUMS MANUALS ARE ALL BUT USELESS FOR LEARNING EASY OPERATION 
THE HOLDEN SEDAN HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENT FOR MORE THAN A DECADE AND WITH THE ADDITION OF THE MAGNETIC SUSPENSION THE TRICK TRANSMISSION AND THE LOW END TORQUE CAPACITY IT IS A JOY TO DRIVE 
THE HOLE SYSTEM JUST SUX IT DOESN T WORK WELL IT FREEZES
THE HOME SCREEN SHOWS RADIO NAVIGATION AND FAVORITE PHONE NUMBERS ON ONE DISPLAY ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH ONE OF THEM TO START USING THAT FUNCTION IT MAKES IT EASY TO CALL SOMEONE WITHOUT SEARCHING FOR A NUMBER WHILE DRIVING 
THE HONDA ACCORD HAS A CAMERA ON THE RIGHT SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT TURNS ON WHEN CHANGING LANES THIS MODEL SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT FEATURE AS WELL 
THE HONDA APP IS JUST TERRIBLE IT ABSOLUTELY SERVES NO PURPOSE AND DOESN T RUN WELL AT ALL 
THE HONDA LINK AND NAVIGATION APP COULD BE OFFERED TO ANDROID USERS
THE HONDALINK APP SEEMS TO ONLY WORK WITH IPHONE WE HAVE WINDOWS AND ANDROID DEVICES SO WE ARE UNABLE TO USE MANY OF THE FEATURES 
THE HONDALINK APPS ARE WEAK AND IT TAKES THREE EXTRA CABLES TO CONNECT MY IPHONE TO THE CAR AND THE MAP APP COSTS $60 AND HAS TERRIBLE RATINGS ONLINE I WISH THE SYSTEM USED APPLE S CARPLAY SYSTEM INSTEAD SO IT INTEGRATED MORE SEAMLESSLY WITH MY 
THE HONDALINK SOFTWARE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED
THE HONDALINK SYSTEM IS A LITTLE HARD TO FIGURE OUT
THE HOOD COULD BE A LITTLE LOWER IN HEIGHT FOR BETTER FORWARD VISIBILITY 
THE HOOD DESIGN IS SUCH THAT IT IS ACTUALLY QUITE DIFFICULT TO JUDGE FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT WHERE THE FRONT OF THE CAR ACTUALLY IS THIS MAKES PARKING WITH NOSE FIRST SOMETIMES DIFFICULT WHEN THERE IS A HIGH CURB IN FRONT OF YOU OR A BOX IN YO 
THE HOOD DESIGN WHERE THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS RECESS SHOULD BE REDESIGNED THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY TO PROTECT THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS FROM ACCUMULATING SNOW MAYBE THERE COULD BE A BUTTON TO PUSH TO OPEN THE AREA FOR THE WIPERS SO THEY CAN RE 
THE HOOD INTERFERES WITH FRONT VISIBILITY UP CLOSE TO THE FRONT OF THE CAR 
THE HOOD IS AT SUCH A SLANT THAT YOU CAN T SEE THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE THE CAR IS LOW AND THIS MAKES IT HARD TO PARK WHEN PULLING INTO SPOTS WITH CURBS OR SMALL CEMENT BARRIERS
THE HOOD IS FAIRLY LARGE SO ITS A LITTLE HARDER ESTIMATING WHERE THE CURB IS WHEN PULLING INTO A PARKING SPOT
THE HOOD IS MONSTEROUS IN SIZE FEEL I CANNOT SEE THE ROAD ADEQUATELY
THE HOOD IS PUFFED UP A BIT WHICH HINDERS VISIBILITY MORE THAN NEED BE 
THE HOOD IS SO ROUNDED IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO GAUGE SO DISTANCES I FOUND I NEEDED TO ADJUST THE SEAT MUCH HIGHER THAN IN THE OLD CADDY 
THE HOOD MAKES IT LOOK LIKE THAT THE VEHICLE IS WIDER THAN THE LANE YOU ARE IN SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE DRIVING A MUCH LARGER VEHICLE THAN YOU ARE 
THE HOOD THING
THE HOOK UP TO THE I POD IN THE GLOVE BOX COULD BE MORE SECURE 
THE HORN
THE HORSEPOWER AND DRIVEABILITY
THE HUGE DISPLAY IS A GREAT FEATURE 
THE HUMAN INTERFACE THE TOUCH SCREEN MENUS ARE ARCHAIC 
THE HYUNDAI FEELS SAFE AND STURDY BUT THE REAR VISIBILITY IS PRETTY SMALL AND I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE PARKING THE CAR IN A TIGHT PARKING SPACE THAT S WHY A REAR VIEW CAMERA IS NECESSARY 
THE I DRIVE BUTTON THAT CONTROLS FEATURES IS ON THE CENTER CONSOLE AS A WOMAN I OFTEN PLACE MY PURSE THERE AND WILL ACTIVATE THAT BUTTON DIALING THE LAST PERSON I CALLED ETC I WISH THE CONTROL DIAL WAS NOT IN THAT LOCATION
THE I DRIVE IS A DREAM 
THE I DRIVE KNOB FOR ADJUSTING / CHANGING
THE ICONS ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ARE NOT CLEAR AS TO WHAT THEY MEAN I DON T USE THEM OFTEN ENOUGH TO KNOW WHICH ICON DOES WHAT BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE 
THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO LOCATE PLACES USING VERBAL COMMANDS 
THE IDEA OF BEING HANDS FREE IT COMFORTING THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM IS REMARKABLE 
THE IDEA OF REMOVING THE FACTORY INSTALLED ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS WRONG THE NEW VERSION IS JUST A FRAME INSTALLATION FOR IPADS THIS IS NOT COOL 
THE IDENTIFICATION SYMBOLS FOR THE STEERING COLUMN CONTROLS FOR HANDS FREE PHONE USE ARE NOT EASY TO SEE ESPECIALLY IF YOU NEED READING GLASSES AND ARE NOT EASY TO INTERPRET MEANING WHAT EACH BUTTON DOES IS NOT INTUITIVE I GET CONFUSED AS TO 
THE IDRIVE CONTROL OF IPHONE IS EASY AND THE MEMORY BUTTONS MAKE IT SUPER EASY TO MAKE CALLS TO MY MOST FREQUENT CONTACTS
THE IDRIVE SYSTEMS RESPONSE AND SPEED IS VIRTUALLY DELAY FREE A RARITY THE SYSTEM RESPONDS INSTANTLY TO INPUTS NO MATTER WHAT IT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING 
THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE REAR CAMERA AND SIZE OF VIEWING SCREEN NOT ALWAYS EASY TO SEE INTO THE STREET WHEN BACKING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY HOWEVER I NOW DEPEND MORE ON THE BACKUP CAMERA WHICH GIVES ME A MUCH BETTER VIEW 
THE IN ABILITY TO USE MY SYSTEM DUE TO FREEZING SCREEN AND THE BLUE TOOTH TURNING OFF AFTER ONE CALL SOMETIMES TAKING IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR THEM SAYING IT WAS FIXED AND IT NOT BEING DONE IS VERY UNACCEPTABLE CLAIMED IT WAS A PATCH UPGRADE 
THE IN CAR APPS ARE TERRIBLE THEY DON T ALWAYS WORK AND INTERNET CONNECTION IS HIT OR MISS
THE IN CAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD DIRECTIONS FROM THE IPHONE 
THE IN COMMUNICATIONS APPLICATION NEEDS WORK TO OPERATE ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS
THE IN CONTROL APP IS NOT WELL DESIGNED LUCKILY I CAN PLAY THE MUSIC FROM MY IPHONE VIA BLUETOOTH BECAUSE THE APP INTERFACE IS AWKWARD NOT INTUITIVE REQUIRES THE IPHONE TO BE ON AND OPEN TO THE IN CONTROL APP AND THE IN CONTROL APP DOES NOTHI 
THE IN CONTROL APPS IS A COMPLETE WASTE IF YOU MADE IT THROUGH BLUETOOTH THEN IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT MORE USEFUL NOT MUCH BUT MORE USEFUL
THE INABILITY TO PROGRAM THE NAV SYSTEM BY THE PASSENGER REALLY PISSES ME OFF IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO HAVE TO PULL OFF ON THE HIGHWAY TO PROGRAM INFORMATION THAN IT WOULD BE TO MAKE CHANGES ON THE FLY 
THE INCLUDED BLIS SYSTEM IS REQUIRED AS THE BLIND SPOTS CAN BE PRETTY BAD 
THE INCONTROL APPS SYSTEM IS WEAK AND POORLY INTEGRATED 
THE INDUCTION CHARGER DOES NOT CHARGE IPHONE 5S AND BEYOND THATS TOO BAD NO ONE HAS A IPHONE4 ANYMORE!
THE INFO SPOT FOR YOUR NEXT SET OF DIRECTIONS WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM HELPS TO KNOW YOUR LANE CHANGES AND NEXT EXITS ETC 
THE INFORMATION DISPLAY IS ANNOYING IT ALWAYS DEFAULTS TO A LIST OF RADIO CHANNELS I WOULD PREFER TO BE ABLE TO SELECT WHICH DISPLAY IS DEFAULT THE PHONE BOOK IS VERY ANNOYING THE SYSTEM IMPORTS VIA BLUETOOTH YOUR PHONE BOOK IT IS VERY DIFF 
THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE NAVIGATION SYSGTEM IS EXCEPTIONAL ESPECIALLY WITH THE HEADS UP DISPLAY 
THE INFORMATION SCREEN IN THE CENTER OF THE DASH IS TO SMALL TO READ BECAUSE THE LETTERING IDENTIFYING EACH SCREEN ARE VERY SMALL AND HARD TO SEE 
THE INFORTAINMENT SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND IN PARTICULAR THE PERFORMANCE DATA RECORDER IS WONDROUS TO HAVE AVAILABLE FOR THE OVERALL ENJOYMENT OF THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE
THE INFOTAINMENT SCREEN IS EXTREMELY SLOW AND GLITCHY
THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM HAS A VERY LEGIBLE AND INTUITIVE DESIGN AND DOES AND IS EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE I DID NOT NEED TO REFER TO THE MANUAL TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM 
THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE THE TOUCHPAD IS TERRIBLE TOO MANY STEPS TO FINDING FREQUENTLY USED FEATURES THE SOUND IS LOUSY FOR THE PRICE A $70K CAR SHOULD PREFORM MUCH BETTER THAN THIS DOES MY OUTDATED AUDI WAS EASIER TO USE AND PE 
THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE BUT IT TAKES A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO LEARN HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH IT AND OPERATE IT IT IS MENU DRIVEN WITH MULTIPLE LEVELS 
THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE CUSTOMIZED BY THE OWNER 
THE INPUTTING OF DIRECTIONS IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SUCKS IT DOESN T ALWAYS LET YOU FINISH TYPING IN THE STREET NAME BEFORE IT GIVES YOU CHOICES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR DESTINATION
THE INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR PARTIALLY BLOCKS VIEW WHEN TURNING RIGHT 
THE INSTANT CONNECTION OF THE BLUETOOTH
THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE SO CONFUSING I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE SYSTEMS!
THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETUP AND USAGE ARE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND CONFUSING HOWEVER I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO HAVE THE DEALER EXPLAIN IT TO ME WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE AND THIS IS MY FIRST CAR WITH BLUE TOOTH CONNECTIVITY 
THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SYSTEM ARE RATHER COMPLICATED BECAUSE WE HAVE ONLY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR THREE MONTHS IT IS DIFFICULT TO RATE ALL OF THE SYSTEMS APPROPRIATELY 
THE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO USE COULD BE EASIER TO FIND 
THE INTEGRATED BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IS FLAWLESS! I LOVE USING MY PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH TO LISTEN TO MUSIC/PODCASTS 
THE INTEGRATED PHONE IS ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER HEARD AND WORKS REALLY WELL 
THE INTEGRATION OF DEVICES LIKE IPODS IS POOR AUDI HAS A PROPRIETARY CONNECTOR SYSTEM SEARCHING FOR MUSIC ON A LARGE IPOD IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WHILE DRIVING 
THE INTEGRATION OF SYSTEM CLEAN UP THE LOOK OF THE CENTER CONSOLE 
THE INTEGRATION OF THE PHONE WITH THE SOUND SYSTEM IS VERY IMPRESSIVE AND STABLE 
THE INTEGRATION OF THE VEHICLE S AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS IS EXCELLENT NAVIGATION THROUGH IDRIVE IS INTUITIVE AND FAST 
THE INTEGRATION OF TRAFFIC INTO ROUTE GUIDANCE IS EXCELLENT 
THE INTEGRATION WITH APPLE IPHONE COULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED THE CAPABILITIES ARE RUDIMENTARY AT BEST EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE OFFERS TEXT READING AND SENDING THAT FEATURES ONLY WORKS WITH ANDROID DEVICES GOOD THING I WASN T DEPENDING ON THAT 
THE INTEGRATION WITH MY IPHONE
THE INTEGRATION/INTUITIVENESS IS GREAT 
THE INTELLINK SYSTEM NEEDS AN APP STORE AND MORE CONNECTIVITY TO IPHONES THERE NEEDS TO HAVE THE OPTION TO WATCH VIDEOS FROM PHONE S LIBRARY & YOUTUBE THE OVERALL SYSTEM IS NICE BUT THE LACK OF APPS FOR ENTERTAINMENT NAVIGATION AND WEATHER IS 
THE INTERCONNECTIVITY BETWEEN MY SAMSUNG GALAXY 5 PHONE AND THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO IS COMPLICATED AND INEFFICIENT I CANT GET IT TO PLAY SMOOTHLY 
THE INTERFACE 
THE INTERFACE AND APPEARANCE OF THE CONTROLS ON THE SCREEN IS ARCHAIC
THE INTERFACE CAN BE COMPLETELY OVERHAULED I FIND IT TO BE VERY CHALLENGING TO NAVIGATE AND USE I ALSO FIND THE INFORMATION DISPLAYED ESPECIALLY USING SATELLITE RADIO IS MINIMAL I AM AN EXTREMELY TECHNICAL PERSON SO FOR ME TO SAY THIS IS A 
THE INTERFACE COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER NISSAN MADE FALSE ADVERTISING AGAINST CONNECTED APPS SINCE MANY OF THE APPS ADVERTISED ARE STILL NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE MODELS WITH NAVIGATION 
THE INTERFACE FOR ALL APPLICATIONS AND USES IS VERY WELL DONE 
THE INTERFACE FOR PLAYING AUDIO FROM AN IPOD IS DIFFICULT TO USE THERE IS TOO MANY STEPS AND YOU NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO BROWSE THE SONGS ON A PLAYLIST OR PODCASTS IN A TOPIC IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE IF THERE WAS A RUNNING TIME DISPLAYED 
THE INTERFACE IS BUSY LOTS OF BUTTONS AND TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO BUT OVERALL I LOVE IT
THE INTERFACE IS GREAT HOWEVER WHEN ON NAVIGATION MODE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE MORE INFO VISIBLE ABOUT WHAT SONG IS PLAYING CURRENTLY THE NAVIGATION ONLY DISPLAYS WHICH CHANNEL YOU RE LISTENING TO MY FIANCéE S MERCEDES BENZ DISPLAYS FULL SO 
THE INTERFACE IS JUST NOT UP TO THE STANDARD WE EXPECT TODAY I WISH I COULD JUST EASILY USE MY PHONE FOR ESSENTIALLY ALL THE NAVIGATION/AUDIO FUNCTIONS 
THE INTERFACE IS NOT THE MOST MODERN WHICH MAY DISCOURAGE MORE TECH TRENDY USERS 
THE INTERFACE IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE
THE INTERFACE IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE THE SMALL SCROLL BALL ON THE STEERING WHEEL IS REALLY THE DEFAULT TOOL TO TOGGLE AROUND AND USE THE SYSTEMS IT COULD BE BETTER AUDIO IS LACKING VOLUME LEVELS NEVER SEEM TO BE LOUD ENOUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN USI 
THE INTERFACE IS ODD AND DODGY TOO MUCH BS TO MOVE FROM AUDIO TO NAV 
THE INTERFACE IS OUTDATED I WOULD PREFER CARPLAY INTEGRATION AND LEVERAGE MY IPHONE 
THE INTERFACE IS SNAPPY AND STYLISH 
THE INTERFACE IS TOO BUSY FOR QUICK AND EASY CONTROL 
THE INTERFACE NEEDS UPDAING THE NEW SYNC 3 0 SHOULD BE BETTER THE ABILITY TO UPDATE THE INTERFACE TO CARPLAY WOULD BE FANTASTIC 
THE INTERFACE ON SCREEN COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE PERHAPS WITH MORE PRESETS ON HOME PAGE STEERING WHEEL SHOULD BE ABLE TO TUNE AUDIO PRESETS EASILY IN CAR APPS ARE MORE COMPLEX THAN NEEDED 
THE INTERFACE WITH THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE USER DRIVER BOTH THE HAND CONTROLS BUTTONS AND DIALS AND VOICE COMMANDS ARE MORE DISTRACTIONS THAN ASSISTANCE TO A DRIVER 
THE INTERFACES AND EASE OF USE STRAIGHT AWAY IS TERRIBLE 
THE INTERIOR DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE IS GREAT AND DRIVER FRIENDLY WHEN IT COMES TO VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY THE CONTROLS ARE EASY TO REACH GREAT JOB!
THE INTERIOR DESIGN PANEL OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM COULD USE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT
THE INTERIOR GIVES OFF A SPUNKY FEELING AND I THINK OF MYSELF AS SPUNKY
THE INTERIOR LIGHTS ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE THE FEATURE BELOW THE DRIVER
THE INTERIOR PANEL SEPARATING THE BACK WINDOW GLASS FROM THE QUARTER PANEL GLASS IS LIGHT GREY WHILE THE REST OF THE INTERIOR IS BLACK THIS WAS POOR DESIGN WHEN YOU LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER TO CHECK FOR CARS IN THE NEXT LANE SEEING THE LIGHT 
THE INTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR DOESN T ALLOW FOR A GREAT VIEW I THINK THIS IS IN PART DUE TO THE SEEMINGLY NARROW REAR WINDOW THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE BIG AND VERY USEFUL 
THE INTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR IS PRETTY USELESS
THE INTERMITENT SETTING OF WIPERS ON THE SLOWEST SETTING IS TOO FAST 
THE INTERMITTENT WINDSHIELD WIPER SETTINGS SEEMINGLY OFFERS ONE SPEED I M NOT PLEASED WITH THIS
THE INTERMITTENT WIPERS ARE NOT VERY EFFECTIVE AS THEY WORK AT TIMES AND DON T SEEM TO ACTIVATE AT OTHER TIMES 
THE INTERMITTENT WIPERS SEEM NOT AS RESPONSIVE AS THEY WERE IN MY FORMER CAR I HAVE TO MANAGE THEM A LOT MORE 
THE INTERNAL HARD DRIVE
THE INTERNAL NAV SYSTEM IS SLOW OR INOPERATIVE AND VERY AGGRAVATING 
THE INTERNET CONNECTION IS VERY SLOW PROBABLY WILL CANCEL AFTER TRIAL PERIOD BECAUSE IT TAKES TOO LONG TO DOWNLOAD ITEMS
THE INTERNET IS DIFFICULT TO ACCESS AND TAKES A LONG TIME TO DOWNLOAD PANDORA WILL NOT DOWNLOAD FOR SOME REASON
THE IPHONE CONNECTIVITY IS TERRIBLE MUCH WORSE THAN MUCH CHEAPER CARS I GET AS RENTALS IN THE END I GAVE UP TRYING TO CONNECT MY IPHONE BECAUSE THE MINI SUPPLIED ACCESSORY DIDN T EVEN WORK THE DEALER COULDN T EVEN FIX IT *VERY* DISAPPOINTING 
THE IPHONE MUSIC / PODCAST SELECTION IS NOT EASY DISPLAY ON THE MAIN SCREEN WOULD BE BETTER A BUTTON TO DISCONNECT THE HANDS FREE WOULD BE HANDY WHEN GETTING OUT OF THE CAR AND CONTINUING A CONVERSATION 
THE IPHONE/IPOD JACK IS NOT DESIGNED FOR NEWER PHONES EVEN THOUGH THIS VEHICLE IS A 2015 I HATE THAT THE IN DASH RADIO CONTROLS DEFAULT TO SATELLITE RATHER THAN PRESETS AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH THE OTHER FEATURES TO GET TO AUDIO 
THE IPOD CONNECTION WIRE SUCKS!!! IT KEEPS FRAYING AND SPLITTING AT THE CONNECTION PART THAT GOES INTO THE IPHONE! I HAVE TAKEN BACK 4 TIMES NOW TO DEALER FOR A NEW ONE!! FIX IT!!!!
THE IPOD CONNECTIVITY IS USELESS CAUSING ME TO HAVE TO USE XM RADIO THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL IT HAS PROBLEMS WITH EVERY PORTION OF ITS CONTROL LACK OF MULTIPLE CD S IS AN ISSUE AND THE USB FUNCTIONALITY IS LIMITED WHY TH 
THE IPOD CONNECTIVITY ISSUES THAT I MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS COMMENTS TO ME THE LACK OF PERFORMANCE WITH THE SYSTEMS IPOD CAPABILITY IS UNACCEPTABLE 
THE IPOD INTEGRATION HAS ISSUES IT RESETS ITSELF PERIODICALLY THE USER INTERFACE IS ALSO NOT GREAT 
THE IPOD INTERFACE IS NOT ABLE TO SHOW PLAYLISTS ARTISTS OR ALBUMS
THE IPOD INTERFACE ISN T VERY INTUITIVE IT S CUMBERSOME TO MOVE BETWEEN FOLDERS AND NOT SOMETHING I WOULD WANT TO DO WHEN DRIVING 
THE IS TRULY A QUALITY SYSTEM ONE OF THE BEST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED HOWEVER IT IS VERY COMPLEX TO USE THE SYSTEM IT SHOULD BE MORE INTUITIVE 
THE ISSUE IS MORE THE CELL PHONE MANUFACTURER S APPLICATIONS APPLE SHUFFLE AND PLAYING MUSIC FROM THE USB ON IPHONE 5 DOES NOT WORK 
THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE IS NOT PARTICULAR TO HYUNDAI BUT PERTAINS TO ALL NEW CARS THEY ARE BUILT SO AERODYNAMICALLY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL WHERE THE FRONT OR BACK OF THE CAR EXACTLY IS WHEN PULLING INTO TIGHTER SPACES YOU LOOK OUT THE WINDS 
THE ISSUE WITH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD THAT FOGS AND WATER SPOTS THAT TAKE SO LONG TO EVAPORATE IT IS A HAZARDOUS ISSUE 
THE ITEMS ARE JUST ABOVE AVERAGE
THE JAG ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY AND SCREEN COULD USE AN UPGRADE A BIT BEHIND OTHER MANUFACTURERS BUT STILL VERY GOOD 
THE JAGUAR CONNECTIVITY APPS NEED A SUBSCRIPTION WHEN PURCHASING A 70K + VEHICLE I WOULD ASSUME THAT FEATURES LIKE THIS WOULD BE INCLUDED 
THE JAGUAR FEELS STABLE AND EASILY CONTROLLED
THE JBL SOUND SYSTEM 
THE JEEP CHEROKEE HAS BETTER GPS TECHNOLOGY PUTTING A ENTIRE ADDRESS IN ONE LINE IS A MAJOR DRAW BACK AS OPPOSED TO CITY NUMBER AND STREET ON SEPARATE LINES THAT RECOGNIZE PARTIAL INPUT AND GIVE YOU QUICK REFERENCES COULD NOT BELIEVE 2015 HAD T 
THE JOYSTICK IN THE CENTER CONSOLE AREA
THE JOYSTICK IS A PAIN SHOULD HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN 
THE JOYSTICK ISN T THE EASIEST THING TO USE AND YOU HAVE TO FIND AND SEARCH FOR INDIVIDUAL LETTERS IT WOULD BE EASY IF IT COULD DO VOICE RECOGNITION 
THE JUKE BOX IS VERY NICE TO HAVE
THE JUKE HAS BLIND SPOTS IT S JUST THE WAY IT S MADE WHEN CHANGING LANES OR MAKING TURNS THE FRONT PILLARS REALLY GET IN THE WAY BUT AGAIN I KNEW THAT GOING IN THIS IS MY SECOND JUKE I LOVE THIS CAR 
THE JUKE HAS THE BEST VISIBILITY OF ANY CAR I VE OWNED
THE JUKE WAS NAVIGATING US THEN SAID TRAFFIC AHEAD WAS SNARLED AND ASKED IF WE WANTED TO CHANGE TO A DIFFERENT ROUTE WE DID AND WE AVOIDED A HUGE TRAFFIC JAM USING A ROUTE I HADN T KNOWN ABOUT THAT WAS COOL I DON T USE IT MUCH BUT I M GLAD 
THE JUKEBOX DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO UPLOAD MOST IF NOT ALL CDS THIS HAS BEEN A REAL HASSLE AND I FRANKLY DON T UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THE JUKEBOX UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES 
THE JUKEBOX FEATURE IS GREAT AND SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL PORSCHES IF IT ISN T ALREADY 
THE JUKEBOX HARD DRIVE HAS ALL 3 500 SONGS FROM MY LIBRARY 
THE KARMON SOUND SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL
THE KEYPAD IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND MAY BE DANGEROUS TO USE WHILE DRIVING IT IS TOO JUMPY AND DOESN T LET YOU SELECT WHAT YOU WANT 
THE KEYPAD IS HARD TO USE AND VERY TOUCHY WOULD PREFER TOUCHSCREEN
THE KEYPAD TO ENTER NAVIGATION INFO 
THE KNOB FOR VOLUME CONTROL IS TOO SMALL
THE KNOB IS DIFFICULT TO USE NOT INTUITIVE ALSO THE ICONS ON THE SIDE OF THE MAP ARE NOT UNDERSTANDABLE 
THE KNOB THAT CONTROLS THE VARIOUS VEHICLE MODES IS IN A POOR LOCATION I M CONSTANTLY BUMPING IT WITH MY ARM NOTICE NOT HAND OR AN OBJECT IT NEEDS TO BE PLACED BACK ON THE DASH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN TO SWITCH BETWEEN 
THE KNOB TO CHANGE THE STATION RADIO OR XM I ACTUALLY HAVE TO LEAN TO DO AND THAT FEELS LIKE I AM DISTRACTED WHILE DRIVING 
THE KNOBS FOR VOLUME AND STATION TUNE ARE WAY TOO SMALL IF YOU TRY TO JUST ADVANCE THE STATION USING THE KNOB ONE STATION YOU HAVE TO BE ULTRA STEADY OR YOU WILL JUMP ABOUT 5 STATIONS I AM STILL NOT SURE HOW TO SAVE STATION PRE SETS THE VOLUME 
THE KNOBS ON THE RADIO FEEL VERY WEAK EASY TO BREAK AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE DRIVER AND THE RADIO ON THE CONSOLE FEEL TO FAR
THE KRELL SOUND SYSTEM
THE LACK OF A COLLISION AVOIDANCE OR BLIND SPOT OR LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEMS THE POORLY PLACED WINDOW CONTROL AND STEERING WHEEL HEATING CLUSTER UNSAFE 
THE LACK OF ON PAR INTEGRATION WITH ANDROID AS APPOSED TO IOS IS FRUSTRATING AND DISHEARTENING GIVEN THE MARKET SHARE ANDROID HAS ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE OF AN EFFORT PUT FORWARD 
THE LACK OF STANDARD BACK UP CAMERA IN THE JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LAREDO IS DISAPPOINTING FRONT VEHICLE VISIBILITY FROM FORWARD SEATING IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED DUE TO THE SIZE AND LENGTH OF HOOD 
THE LACK OF VOLUME NOT LOAD ENOF 
THE LADY IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY NICE SHE KNOWS HOW TO SAY PLEASE WHICH HELPS RELIEVE STRESS WHILE DRIVING
THE LAG TIME I SOMETIMES EXPERIENCE WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE A SONG WITH THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION COULD BE INVESTIGATED AND IMPROVED 
THE LAND CRUISER IS THE CONSUMMATE SUV
THE LAND CRUISER IS THE ONLY VEHICLE I HAVE HAD IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT HAS CONSTANT DEAD SPOTS WITH THE SATELLITE RADIO
THE LAND ROVER JAGUAR INCONTROL APPS FEATURE VERY CONFUSING WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO WORK WITH IT THEY SAY THERE ARE APPS TO MANAGE TEXTS WHILE DRIVING BUT WHEN YOU TRY TO DOWNLOAD THE APP IT DOESN T EXIST I HAVE CALLED LAND ROVER CORPORATE AND TH 
THE LANE CHANGE BLIND SPOT IS A BIT LARGE BUT THE BLIND SPOT INDICATER HELPS WITH THAT 
THE LANE CHANGE WARNING IS A LIFESAVER!
THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM IS GREAT!!!1
THE LANE CHANGING ALERT IS PROBABLY SOMETHING EVERY VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE IT IS AN AMAZING SAFETY FEATURE 
THE LANE CHANGING ALERT IS REALLY SENSITIVE 
THE LANE CHANGING NOTIFICATIONS ARE VERY HELPFUL
THE LANE CHANGING SYSTEM HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL WITH BLIND SPOTS SINCE THE VEHICLE IS SO BIG 
THE LANE CHANGING WARNING AND AUTOMATIC SPEED REDUCTION SEEMS LIKE OVERKILL 
THE LANE CHANGING WARNING IS FANTASTIC
THE LANE CHANGING WARNING SYSTEM COMPENSATES FOR ANY BLIND SPOTS 
THE LANE DEPARTURE AND BLIND SPOT COLLISION AVOIDANCE ARE INCREDIBLE I DON T KNOW HOW THE US AUTO INDUSTRY HADN T COME UP WITH THOSE GREAT SYSTEMS YEARS AGO
THE LANE DEPARTURE AND BLIND SPOT SYSTEM IS AWESOME 
THE LANE DEPARTURE AVOIDANCE ALARMS CAN BE A BIT TRYING ON NARROW LANES OF TRAVEL OVER LONG DISTANCES HOWEVER THE OCCASIONAL ANNOYANCE IS PREFERABLE GIVEN THE ALTERNATIVE OF ATTEMPTING TO OCCUPY THE SAME SPACE AS ANOTHER VEHICLE 
THE LANE DEPARTURE SYSTEM DOESN T WORK VERY ACCURATELY IN LOCAL TRAFFIC ALTHOUGH IT WORKS PRETTY WELL ON HIGHWAYS THE BLIND SPOT SENSING SYSTEM GOES OUT OF SERVICE RATHER TOO OFTEN 
THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING AND FORWARD COLLISION WARNING ARE VERY SENSITIVE ALMOST TOO MUCH SO I KNOW THEY CAN BE ADJUSTED BUT I HAVEN T TRIED THAT YET SO IT S NOT REALLY A COMPLAINT PER SE I TURNED OFF THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING BECAUSE IT 
THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEM IS A BIT ANNOYING THOUGH I GUESS IT S FOR MY OWN GOOD 
THE LANE DETECTION IS FANTASTIC AND NOT OVERBEARING 
THE LANE WATCH AND BACKUP CAMERAS HELP ROUND OUT THE VISIBILITY FOR THE CAR 
THE LANEWATCH CAMERA WOULD BE VERY USEFUL ON THE DRIVER SIDE ALSO 
THE LARGE AMOUNT OF WINDOW SPACE WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE CHOSE THE FORESTER 
THE LARGE CLEAR SCREEN AND THE MULTI USE HOME SCREEN
THE LARGE DISPLAY SCREEN IS VERY USEFUL
THE LARGE FORWARD SLOPING WINDSHIELD SUPPORTS RESULT IN A VERY BAD BLIND SPOT AT THE 2 00 TO 3 00 POSITION WHEN AT A STOP SIGN 
THE LARGE HEAD REST THAT TILT FORWARD ARE THE WORSE !! THEY OBSTRUCT VISIBILITY AND CAUSE A BLIND SPOT THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS ALSO CAUSE A BLIND SPOT 
THE LARGE LEFT REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS VIEW OF CLOSE LEFT FRONT VIEW 
THE LARGE MIRRORS AND WINDOWS REALLY REDUCE THE BLINDSPOTS
THE LARGE REAR WINDOW IS ESPECIALLY NICE 
THE LARGE REAR/SIDE VIEW MIRRORS CAUSE BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY WITH SMALL VEHICLES I PERSONNALLY HAVE COME CLOSE TO HAVING TWO COLLISIONS DUE TO THE OVERSIZED REAR/SIDE VIEW MIRRORS VERY SMALL VEHICLE ARE DIFFICULT TO SEE AT A FOUR WAY INTERSECTI 
THE LARGE SCREEN 
THE LARGE SCREEN IS USEFUL BUT COULD IT FLIP DOWN OR NOT LOOK LIKE A PHONE CHARGING STATION STICKING OUT OF THE TOP OF THE DASHBOARD? EVERYBODY WANTS TO UNPLUG IT FROM THE DASH 
THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS HELP TO ELIMINATE BLIND SPOTS 
THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS WHICH I LOVE ARE HARD TO SEE AROUND SOMETIMES 
THE LARGE SIDE PILLAR SOMETIMES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE ONCOMING VEHICLES WHEN TURNING INTO A LANE OF TRAFFIC
THE LARGE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE EXCELLENT! I LOVE THEM 
THE LARGE TRUNK SEEMS TO CUT OFF SOME VISIBILITY I TRADED A DODGE AVENGER FOR THIS CHRYSLER AND THAT WAS VERY NOTICEABLE WHEN I FIRST DROVE THE CHRYSLER 
THE LARGE WINDOWS ARE AWESOME!!!
THE LARGER SCREEN SIZE IS SAFER AND BETTER LOOKING USING NAV WHILE DRIVING IS CRITICAL 
THE LAST CAR I HAD WAS A 1998 ACURA CL THE TECHNOLOGY IS ALL NEW TO ME I FEEL LIKE I AM DRIVING AROUND IN A MILLION DOLLAR CAR BUT IT REALLY WASN T THAT EXPENSIVE BEING ABLE TO TAKE A CALL WHILE I DRIVE KNOWING IF I NEED HELP GETTING TO A PLA 
THE LAY OUT OF THE DISPLAY THAT IS SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE 
THE LAYOUT AND FUNCTION ARE FLAWLESS AND EVERYTHING WORKS EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD 
THE LAYOUT FOR ME TO USE THE DIALS AND NOT HAVE TO LOOK DOWN AND AWAY FROM THE ROAD IS PHENOMENAL 
THE LAYOUT IS VERY EASY TO NAVIGATE I DON T HAVE TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TRYING TO LOCATE THE SYSTEM I AM LOOKING TO USE 
THE LAYOUT OF THE BUTTONS ON THE NAV/AUDIO SCREEN FORCES ME TO SCROLL TO SWITCH BETWEEN BLUETOOTH AUDIO AND THE OTHER AUDIO FUNCTIONS LIKE XM IT REALLY SHOULD ALLOW THE USER TO ARRANGE THEM ALSO IF THE SCREEN WAS BIGGER WITH BIGGER BUTTONS THEY 
THE LAYOUT OF THE CONTROLS FOR THE AUDIO COM AND ENTERTERTAINMENT DRIVER THE DIAL AND THE EYE LEVEL SCREEN ARE EXCELLENT MUCH BETTER THEN THE INFINITI 350FX THAT I USED TO DRIVE 
THE LAYOUT OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE
THE LAYOUT OF THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS 
THE LCD DISPLAY IS MONOCHROME I WONDER IF COLOR WOULD LOOK BETTER 
THE LEAF WITH ITS ADVANCED ELECTRIC DRIVE TRAIN DOESN T REALLY OFFER VERY MUCH IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL SAFETY FEATURES BEYOND THINGS LIKE AIRBAGS THE TOYOTA RAV4 I HAD BEFORE WITH BLIND SPOT DETECTION AND LANE DEPARTURE WARNING HAD MUCH MORE ADVA 
THE LEARNING CURVE FOR THE VOICE COMMANDS IS STEEP AND I NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME PRACTICING WITH IT WHILE READING THE OWNER S MANUAL S LIST OF COMMANDS WHEN THE CAR IS PARKED AT HOME I CAN T USE IT AS EFFICIENTLY AS MY SALESMAN AND I D LIKE TO 
THE LEARNING CURVE IS TOO HIGH SIMPLIFY THE USE OF THE CONTROLS 
THE LED ADAPTIVE HEADLIGHTS ARE A GREAT FEATURE IN THE DARK 
THE LED DRIVING LIGHTS ARE VERY BRIGHT AND LIGHTS UP DARK ROADS REALLY WELL 
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE AMAZING
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE EXCELLENT 
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE GREAT BUT THE PLASTIC ENCLOSURE DISTORTS THE VISABILITY I SEE PINK AND ORANGE CONCENTRATIONS OF LIGHT DISTORTION WHEN I DRIVE UP TO A WALL 
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE LESS BENEFICIAL AND DISTRACT OTHER DRIVERS
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE OUTSTANDING AND EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE ON COUNTRY ROADS I WAS VERY IMPRESSED THAT THEY WERE A STANDARD FEATURE AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT MADE ME PURCHASE THE MERCEDES HOWEVER I THINK THAT MZB SHOULD MAKE THE DYNAM 
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AND REALLY COOL TOO!
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY NICE AND PROVIDE GREAT VISIBILITY AT NIGHT
THE LED HEADLIGHTS DON T SEEN AS BRIGHT AS OTHERS I VE OWNED 
THE LED HEADLIGHTS HAVE RESTRICTED VERTICAL LIGHTING WHEN GOING DOWN/UP HILLS A WIDER VERTICAL LIGHTING CAPABILITY AND/OR AUTO ADJUSTMENT FEATURE IS NEEDED ESPECIALLY UP!
THE LED HEADLIGHTS PROVIDE GOOD LIGHTING AT NIGHT AND THE AUTO HIGHBEAM ASSISTANCE WORKS VERY WELL 
THE LED HEADLIGHTS WORK GREAT IN BAD WEATHER LIKE RAIN I FEEL THEY ARE BRIGHTER THAN THE XENON HEADLIGHTS IN MY PREVIOUS CAR 
THE LED ISSUE IN THE SIDE MIRRORS PRVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE VISIBILITY ISSUES STEM FROM THE RIDE HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE 
THE LED JEWEL HEADLIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL AND PROVIDES EXCELLENT VISIBILITY 
THE LED LIGHTS ARE AMAZING I CAN T BELIEVE HOW CLEAR I CAN SEE DOWN ROADS WITH NO STREET LIGHTS THE TELESCOPING PART OF THE SUN VISORS ARE GREAT AS I CAN PULL THE VISOR VERTICALLY TO BLOCK THE SEARING SUN OF THE SUN SHINE STATE 
THE LEFT AND RIGHT PANELS FROM THE BODY OF THE CAR THAT FRAME THE WINDSHIELD OBSCURE VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT THOUGH THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH MOST CARS 
THE LEFT OUTSIDE MIRROR HAS A CIRCULAR MIRROR ATTACHED TO IT TO INDICATE IF A VEHICLE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT THIS FEATURE IS WORTHLESS 
THE LEFT SIDE MIRROR COULD TURN OUT A LTTLE BIT MORE TO VIEW THE NEXT LANE TRAFFIC 
THE LEFT SIDE MIRROW SIGNAL LIGHT IS DISTRACTING AT NIGHT 
THE LEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR BLOCK VISION WHEN TURNING IT WOULD HELP IF THEY WERE A BIT SMALLER AND MOUNTED LOWER 
THE LEFT/RIGHT BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS NEW TO ME SO I AM GETTING USED TO RELYING ON IT WHILE ENSURING THAT I DRIVE SAFELY ANYWAY BUT IT IS CLEARLY A STRONG ADVANTAGE FOR ME AS A DRIVER THE VISORS ARE OK BUT I THINK THEY ARE SLIGHTLY LES 
THE LEGAL DISCLAIMER COMES UP EVERY TIME I TURN ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ANNOYING 
THE LEGENDS FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM ARE DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH 
THE LENGTH OF TIME TO CONNECT TO CELL PHONE CAN BE IMPROVED
THE LENS ON THE BACKUP CAMERA IS TOO EASILY OBSCURED BY RAIN AND GRIME 
THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY IS AMAZING I THINK IT COULD BE MADE TO OPERATE MORE SIMPLY HOWEVER THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE LEVEL OF THE BASE INTERIOR IS OUTSTANDING SO I THINK THE AUDIO SPEAKERS SHOULD INCLUDE A NAME BRAND/PREMIUM STOCK SPEAKER ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE ARE 8 SPEAKERS IN THE CAR 
THE LEXICON 17 SPEAKER STEREO IS CRYSTAL CLEAR WITHOUT ANY DISTORTION HOWEVER IT COULD USE A SEPARATE DEDICATED AMPLIFIER JUST FOR THE BASE PORTION 
THE LEXUS APP THAT CAN BE INSTALLED ON A SMARTPHONE WHICH ALLOWS GREAT INTEGRATION WITH THE CAR S SYSTEM IS FANTASTIC AND VERY INNOVATIVE 
THE LEXUS ENFORM SUITE IS A GIANT NUISANCE
THE LEXUS GUI AND TOUCHPAD CONTROL COULD USE AN OVERHAUL IT S OK BUT IT REALLY DOESN T STRIVE TO BE A LEADER IN INTEGRATION IN THE LUXURY MARKET I REALLY FEEL THAT TOYOTA NEEDS TO SPEND MORE RESEARCH WORKING WITH CUSTOMERS TO TAKE THEIR SYSTEM U 
THE LIFT GATE MOTOR BLOCKS MY VIEW IN THE REAR WINDOW THE HUMP CUTS OFF THE DRIVER S LEFT SIGHTLINE 
THE LIGHT WEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE IS TOUGH TO HANDLE WITH WINDS OVER 20 MPH OR GUSTING 
THE LIGHTS COULD BE MORE BRIGHT AND MOVE WITH THE CAR TURNS
THE LIGHTS PROVIDE GREAT VISION AND THE OVERALL VISION IS MUCH BETTER THAN CHEVYS CAMARO
THE LIGHTS WERE TOO FOCUSED ON THE ROAD WHEN DRIVING DOWNHILL LATE AT NIGHT ON A DARK WINDING ROAD LOST THE FRONT VIEW MOMENTARILY 
THE LIMITED MODEL SHOULD HAVE CHANGING LANES SENSOR AND WARNINGS BECAUSE THIS VEHICLE HAVE A LIMITED REAR SIDE VISION 
THE LIMITED VISIBILITY IS A RESULT OF THE EXTERIOR STYLING OF THE VEHICLE TO IMPROVE THE VISIBILITY YOU WOULD RUIN THE LINES OF THE VEHICLE YOU CAN T HAVE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME! DODGE GOT THE STYLING/VISIBILITY TRADEOFF JUST RIGHT WITH THE CH 
THE LIMITED VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW VIA THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS DISCONCERTING 
THE LINCOLN HIBIRD DESIGN INGENUITY IS ELEGANT AND THE AUTOMOBILE OUTCLASSES ALL OTHERS BAR NONE!
THE LINE IN THE HEADLIGHTS MAKES IT HARD TO SEE UP AN ONCOMING HILL IF YOU ARE GOING DOWN ONE IF YOU AREN T USING HIGH BEAMS 
THE LINES OF SIGHT IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE LIST OF MOVEMENTS THAT IS DISPLAYED WHILE A SYMPHONIC OR OPERATIC WORK PLAYS 
THE LITTLE BLIND SPOT MIRROR WITHIN THE DRIVER S SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS GREAT HOWEVER SINCE THERE IS NOT ONE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE VIEW MIRROR IT IS A BIT SCARY SOMETIMES CHANGING LANES 
THE LITTLE INSET MIRROR IN THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR IS GREAT! OVERALL VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS IS VERY GOOD THANKS TO GOOD MIRROR COVERAGE AND GENEROUS GLASS IT WOULD BE NICE IF OUTSIDE MIRRORS DIMMED AUTOMATICALLY HEADLIGHT PATTERN ON HI 
THE LITTLE MIRROR ON THE DOOR MIRRORS IS VERY DISTRACTIVE FOR ME DISTORTS MY HABIT OF CHANGING LANES AND DISTANCE OF CARS IN OTHER LANES PERSONALLY I USE THE REGULAR STANDARD LIKE MY 2004 LS HAD HOPEFULLY I WILL GET USE TO IT I M OLD DRA 
THE LITTLE MIRRORS INSIDE THE CORNERS FOR SEEING IS THE BEST OPTION I LOVE THEM
THE LITTLE ROLLER KNOB ON STEERING WHEEL TO ROLL TO NEXT OR PRIOR STATION DOESNT ROLL SOMETIMES INSTEAD ACTING AS A PUSH WHICH TAKES YOU TO DIFFERENT MODE RATHER THAN ROLLING TO NEXT/PRIOR STATION
THE LITTLE THAT I HAVE USED THE PHONE I HAVE FOUND THAT IT HAS TROUBLE PICKING UP MY VOICE OVER THE ROAD NOISE 
THE LITTLE TRIANGLE WINDOWS IN THE FRONT ARE NOT VERY HELPFUL AND OBSTRUCTIVE
THE LOCATION OF CONTROLS
THE LOCATION OF IMPUT USB CURRENTLY IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE AND GET TO EASILY
THE LOCATION OF THE AUDIO CONTROLS COULD BE PLACED HIGHER 
THE LOCATION OF THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE POST SIDE POST AND THE HEIGHT OF THE HOOD ALL PROVIDE FOR SLIGHTLY LESS VISIBILITY THAN IN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE SO I HAVE TO BE MORE CAUTIOUS 
THE LOCATION OF THE KNOB TO CHANGE THE STATIONS 
THE LOCATION OF THE SPEAKERS IN THE CHALLENGER MAKE IT SOUND AS THOUGH YOU ARE AT A CONCERT THE SOUND IS TRULY AMAZING THE SOUND IN THE CHALLENGER IS THE FIRST TRULY STEREO SYSTEM I HAVE HAD THE ENJOYMENT OF LISTENING TO!
THE LOCATION OF THE USB PORT
THE LOCATION OF THE USB PORT IS IN THE MOST AWKWARD PLACE IT SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE DASH
THE LOCKOUT FOR DESTINATIONS WHILE MOVING
THE LOGIC BEHIND THE SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH MY KYOCERA PHONE THE AUDIO IS ALWAYS QUITE SO I HAVE TO TURN UP THE AUDIO WHICH THEN IS TO LOUD UPON DISCONNECT 
THE LOGIC USED TO CONNECT AND PLAY FROM A USB CONNECTED DEVICE CORRECT IT SO THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE SAME SONG EVERY TIME I TURN ON THE AUDIO SYSTEM THE SYNC SYSTEM IN MY FORD WORKS MUCH BETTER IN THIS ASPECT THE WAY IT IS NOW 
THE LOOK
THE LOOK AND DESIGN
THE LOOK FEEL AND SOUND
THE LOOK OF CUE IS SHARP THE SOUND QUALITY IS FANTASTIC THE TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY USER FRIENDLY AND EASY TO USE I USE BLUETOOTH AND VOICE COMMANDS DAILY IN MY VEHICLE WHICH MAKES IT MUCH SAFER WHEN DRIVING VERY EASY TO PLAY PANDORA THROUGH MY 
THE LOOK OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED PERHAPS BY ADDING BETTER AND MORE ATTRACTIVE BACKLIGHTING 
THE LOOK OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS REALLY LOW QUALITY IF YOU DON T UPGRADE TO THE NAVIGATION PACKAGE IF YOU DON T HAVE NAV YOUR AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD STILL LOOK PREMIUM IT S A BMW EVEN FORD AUDIO SYSTEMS LOOK MORE PREMIUM THAN A 5 SERIES WITHOUT NAV
THE LOOK OF THE DISPLAY IS LESS THAN LOOKS CHEAPISH COULD HAVE USED SOME COLORS RATHER THAN THE GRAY LOOK 
THE LOOK OF THE ICONS AND SCREEN IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN OLD LOOK
THE LOOK OF THE INFOTAINMENT CENTER IS A LITTLE LACKING THE LOOK AND FEEL OF MY 2015 CAMARO S INFOTAINMENT CENTER WAS A LOT SLEEKER AND MORE RESPONSIVE AND THATS ODD CONSIDERING THEY RE BOTH CHRYSLER S 
THE LOOK OF THE SYSTEM IS AMAZING 
THE LOOK OF THE TOUCH SCREEN COULD BE IMPROVED GREATLY OR GIVE YOU THE OPTION TO CUSTOMIZE THE BACKGROUND
THE LOOK/GRAPHICS OF THE DISPLAY ARE A PERFECT BLEND QUALITY WITHOUT BEING OVER THE TOP 
THE LOUD BUZZING/WHINE NOISE ALREADY REPORTED THIS EARLIER IN THIS SURVEY THAT I HAVE TO LISTEN TO INTERMITTENTLY WHENEVER I LISTEN TO THE RADIO THIS NOISE COMES AND GOES BUT IS THERE 50% OF THE TIME MAKING MY LISTENING EXPERIENCE PRETTY MISER 
THE LOUDNESS OF THE SYSTEM 
THE LOUDSPEAKERS / SOUND SYSTEM STANDARS D NOT UPGRADED LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED COMPARED TO MY PREVIOUS MERCEDES E CLASS THE RC OFFERS VERY INFERIOR QUALITY
THE LOW BEAM HEAD LIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL AND PROVIDE GREAT VISBILITY 
THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE REALLY DISAPPOINTING FOR LED HEADLIGHTS HIGH BEAMS ARE FINE BUT THE LOW BEAMS ARE SUBPAR 
THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS SEEM A LITTLE WEAK 
THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS SEEM TO AIM LA BIT LOW I AM PLANNING TO VISIT MY DEALER SOON TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT 
THE LOW BEAMS POINT TO LOW 
THE LOW BEANS ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH BUT THE HIGH BEAMS ARE WONDERFUL THIS IS WHY I GAVE IT A 6 FOR LIGHTING OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN A 9
THE LOW PROFILE DIP IN FRONT SCRAPES ALL THE TIME 
THE LOW REAR VISIBILITY CAN BE REMEDIED BY AN AFTERMARKET REARVIEW MIRROR LIKE I HAVE OR TURNING YOUR HEAD A LITTLE MORE 
THE LOW ROLLING RESISTANCE TIRES SHOULD BE AN OPTION FOR THOSE WHO NEED TO MAXIMIZE RANGE IN THE RAIN AND WHEN DRIVING WITHOUT RANGE EXTENSION IN MIND THE SLICKNESS OF THE TIRES CAN BE DANGEROUS 
THE LT MODEL NEED HID LIGHTS STANDARD 
THE LUXURIOUS LOOK 
THE LX DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM AND NO NAVIGATION I M NOT VERY HAPPY 
THE M5 S ROAD FEEL IS OUTSTANDING!
THE MACAN IS SO STABLE AND ACCELERATES SO EFFORTLESSLY THAT I FEAR I WILL GET A SPEEDING TICKET BECAUSE I DIDN T REALIZE HOW FAST I WAS GOING THE SPEEDOMETER WORKS JUST FINE BUT IT FEELS LIKE I M JUST GOING 35 MPH WHEN I M ACTUALLY GOING 50 
THE MAIN BUTTON THAT USE FOR THE SYSTEM IT S NOT VERY FRIENDLY WHEN I M DRIVING
THE MAIN CONTROL ON THE CENTER ARM REST AREA IS EASILY BUMPED
THE MAIN DECIDING FACTOR FOR ME TO BUY THE CAR WAS THE FEELING OF SAFETY 
THE MAIN FRUSTRATION IS THAT THE VOLUME BUTTON IS HARD TO TURN UP AND DOWN 
THE MAIN OR DETAILED INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY EXTENSIVE AND NOT THAT EASY TO FOLLOW 
THE MAIN PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT I WAS GIVEN A V6 WHEN MY TRADE IN CAR WAS A V8 HEMI I WAS TOLD I WAS GETTING THE SAME CAR NOT HAPPY WITH THE ENGINE
THE MAIN PROBLEM OF THIS MODEL IS DEVIATION IN THE SNOW MACHINE DOES NOT PERHAPS HAVE THE BEST SYSTEM WITH SRS HEAVY WEIGHT BACK TO NOT DEVIATE IN SNOW
THE MAIN SCREEN IS TOO MUCH INFO IT IS A HASSLE TO SWITCH AROUND
THE MAIN THING I LIKE ABOUT THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS ARE THAT THEY WORK RELIABLY HOWEVER SOME OF THE NAVIGATION THROUGH THOSE MENUS IS NOT AS STREAMLINED AS IT COULD BE FINDING AN ADDRESS DOESN T FEEL AS 
THE MAJOR ISSUE WITH MY NX 200T IS THE HEADRESTS THEY ARE TOO LARGE AND TALL VERY VIEW OBSTRUCTING I TOOK ALL OF THE OUT SO I COULD VISIBLY SEE TO DRIVE!!! BIG ISSUE WITH ME I PAID MONEY FOR THESE AND I WONDER IF THEY CAN BE REPLACED WITH 
THE MANEUVERABILITY OF THE VEHICLE AND THE POWER FROM THE ENGINE MAKE ME CONFIDENT THAT I WILL BE EASILY ABLE TO AVOID SITUATIONS THAT MIGHT COMPROMISE SAFETY 
THE MANUAL ADJUST HEADLIGHTS ARE GENIUS
THE MANUAL CONTROLS CAN BE TOUCHY AND TO EASILY SELECT SOMETHING THAT YOU DON T WANT THE MIC FOR THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO DOES NOT PICK UP PASSENGERS VERY WELL 
THE MANUAL DUPLICATE CONTROLS ON THE CENTER CONSUL ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS ASKED ABOUT THE TOUCH SCREEN AND I INDICATED I RARELY USE IT THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE OUTSTANDING CONTROLS ON THE CONSOLE 
THE MANUAL FOR THE VEHICLE WAS CONFUSING AND INACCURATE FOR THE MODEL I PURCHASED 
THE MANUAL IS DIFFICULT TO STAND AND USE
THE MANUAL TRANSMISSION MAKES THE CAR SAFER FOR CAREFUL AND EXPERIENCED DRIVERS SHIFTING TO A LOWER GEAR GIVES ME POWER TO PASS FASTER ON TWO LANE HIGHWAYS AND MORE OPTIONS WHEN MERGING I VE DRIVEN THROUGH ST LOUIS IN AN AUTOMATIC SUB COMPACT 
THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD REVIEW ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH ONSTAR AND DEMAND IMPROVEMENTS ONSTAR HAS BECOME EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE IN RECENT MONTHS A CHANGE FROM ITS PREVIOUS HIGH STANDARD OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IT NOW TAKES FOREVER TO GET A CALL ANSWERE 
THE MANY CHOICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE 
THE MANY FEATURES 
THE MANY MANY WAYS TO USE IT
THE MANY WAYS WE CAN USE AND ENJOY THESE SYSTEMS ARE USEFUL AND WELCOME WE LIKE THE VARIETY AND THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND AND IT IS EASY TO CHANGE THE SETTINGS FOR EACH DRIVER AND MODIFY EASILY TO SUIT THE PASSENGERS 
THE MAP AND GRAPHICS ON IT ARE NOT SO GOOD I LIKE THE ROGUE MORE ALSO THE MICROPHONE ON THE TRUCK IS NOT SO CLEAR WHEN RECIEVED I AM TOLD 
THE MAP AND NAVIGATION ARE TERRIBLE WHEN COMPARED TO WHAT IS AVAILABLE THROUGH GOOGLE WAZE ETC 
THE MAP DISPLAY IS HARD TO READ YOU CAN T ZOOM IN AS CLOSE AS I WOULD LIKE I ACTUALLY JUST USE MY IPHONE MAPS APP AND SET IT UP RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE NAVIGATION SCREEN 
THE MAP INTERFACE NEEDS TO BE MORE SIMPLE AND EASY ON THE EYES THERE IS JUST TOO MUCH INFO AT A TIME DIFFICULT TO READ WHEN IN A HURRY 
THE MAP IS BIG AND EASY TO READ 
THE MAP IS HARD TO VIEW AND READ EVEN PASSENGERS CANNOT READ THE TYPE ON THE SCREEN FOR STREET NAMES 
THE MAP IS SOMEWHAT DISTURBING I ALWAYS INDICATES THAT NORTH IS AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN NO MATTER WWHICH DIRECTION THE ARE HEADING WE HVE HAD A NUMBER OF BOTH HANDHELD AND BUILTIN GPS AND THE GENESIS IS THE ONLY THAT ALWAY POINTS SHOWS NOTH AT 
THE MAP IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE NORTH IS USUALLY STRAIGHT UP AND IT IS NOT ON THE MAP 
THE MAP ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT ORIENT TO THE DIRECTION THE CAR IS HEADING RATHER IT SHOWS DIRECTION OFF OF THE COMPASS SHOWING NORTH IF YOU RE GOING SOUTH IT SHOWS ON THE MAP THAT THE VEHICLE IS GOING SOUTH ON THE MAP AND NOT THE D 
THE MAP ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CLEARLY LOW DEFINITION IT COULD BE IMPROVED 
THE MAP PART IS REALLY HARD TO USE TO HAVE TO TYPE IN THE DESTINATION IS CUMBERSOME 
THE MAP POINTS OF INTETEST SND DRIVING DIRECTIONS HAVE SENT US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION MANY TIMES WE USE OUR PHONE FOR DIRECTIONS MUCH MORE RELIABLE
THE MAP RESOLUTION IS MINIMAL UNLESS YOU ZOOM WAY IN I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE MORE STREET DETAILS AND NAMES WITHOUT HAVING TO ZOOM IN SO FAR 
THE MAP SIZE IS DIFFICULT TO CHANGE WHEN DRIVING YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR FINGER TIP TO TRY AND CHANGE THE SIZE OF THE MAP SCOPE WHICH IS OFTEN INACCURATE AND FRUSTRATING
THE MAP SYSTEM LOOKS MUCH MORE PRIMITIVE THAN SAY GOOGLE MAPS 
THE MAP VOICE IN THIS YEAR S MODELS IS SOOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAD IN A PREVIOUS HYUNDAI THE VOICE IS MUCH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND 
THE MAP ZOOM INCREMENTS ARE TOO LARGE 
THE MAPS ARE NOT AS UP TO DATE AS THEY CAN BE AND THEY ROUTE SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE WHEN YOU ARE CHOOSING TO GO A DIFFERENT ROUTE THEN IT IS RECOMMENDING UNTIL WELL INTO THE DIRECTION YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING 
THE MAXIMUM VOLUME SETTING IS EXTREMELY LOW FOR THE RADIO 
THE MAZDA 3 HAS A LARGE BODY AND HOOD WHICH MAKES IT LOOK VERY NICE AND NEW BUT I HAVE TO SIT A LITTLE HIGHER TO SEE PROPERLY OVER THE HOOD AS A RESULT I CANNOT FLIP THE SUN VISORS UP OR DOWN WHILE WEARING A HAT WITHOUT DUCKING OUT OF THE WAY 
THE MB SYSTEM IS POORLY INTEGRATED WITH THE IPHONE THE MB SYSTEM WORKS LIKE AN ANTIQUE IT HAS IMPROVED VERY LITTLE IN 15 YEARS THE PROBLEMS SHOULD BE EASY TO FIX SIMPLY UPGRADE THE MB SOFTWARE TO THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE IPHONE ADDRESS BOOK A 
THE MEDIA DISPLAY IS OUTDATED FOR ENTERTAINMENT THERE IS NO INTERFACE WITH SMARTPHONE FOR TEXT MESSAGES CANNOT SEND OR RECEIVE THE MEDIA DISPLAY WHEN CONNECTED TO SIRUSXM IS VERY ELEMENTARY NO ARTIST ART JUST STATION LOGO AND WRITTEN TEXT 
THE MEDIA STATION IS NOT EASY TO USE AT ALL NEEDS TO BE SIMPLIFIED
THE MEMORY BUTTONS DO NOT WORK ACCURATELY
THE MENU FOR RADIO PRESETS IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE ITS DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DELETE A STATION YOU DON T WANT ITS JUST NOT AN INTUITIVE SYSTEM IT TAKES TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK IT PROPERLY
THE MENU IS CUMBERSOME AND NOT INTUITIVE 
THE MENU SYSTEM CAN BE MORE SIMPLIFIED AND USER SETTING REMEMBERED 
THE MENU SYSTEM FOR THE SMALL DISPLAY IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND IF A MENU SELECTION IS SURROUNDED IN BLUE IT IS SELECTED WHY IS ANOTHER ONE CHANGED TO A BLUE BACKGROUND? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
THE MENU SYSTEM IS LITTLE CONFUSING ESPECIALLY FOR PLAYING MUSIC FROM A DEVICE CONNECTED EITHER BY USB OR THE BLUETOOTH 
THE MENU SYSTEMS ARE VERY DIFFICULT AND NON INTUITIVE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETIMES I END UP IN A PLACE AND ON THE SCREEN THAT I DON T KNOW HOW TO RETURN FROM TOO MANY MENU LAYERS 
THE MENU TO USE THE MP3 PLAYER HAS TOO MANY SCREENS TO GET THROUGH IN ORDER TO FIND A SONG ON A PLAYLIST EYES ARE OFF THE ROAD TOO LONG NAVIGATION CAN T ALWAYS FIND A PLACE OF INTEREST 
THE MENUS HAVE TOO MANY STEPS AND TOO MANY FEATURES HAVE TO BE ACCESSED THROUGH THE TOUCH SCREEN AND NOT THROUGH PHYSICAL CONTROLS 
THE MERCEDES BENZ DRIVING SAFETY IS OUTSTANDING WAY TO GO MERCEDES!
THE MERCEDES COMMAND CENTER WORKS WELL BUT HAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS ESPECIALLY IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
THE MERIDIAN SOUND SYSTEM HAS GREAT HIGH FREQUENCIES BUT LACKS IN LOW FREQUENCIES BASS ALSO THE NAVIGATION LOOKS TERRIBLE!
THE MERIDIAN SOUND SYSTEM IS AWESOME 
THE MERIDIAN SOUND SYSTEM IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL THE IN CONTROL APPS FOR MUSIC IPOD NEEDS IMPROVEMENT SEEMS LIKE A STEP BEHIND IN TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH EVEN MUCH CHEAPER CARS 
THE MESSAGE THAT PERIODICALLY APPEARS ON THE SCREEN WHEN A BLUE TOOTH DEVICE CONNECTS WHICH STATES SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF NOT KEEPING YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD CAN CAUSE ACCIDENTS IS EXTREMEMLY DISTRATCTING YOU HAVE TO DISMESS THE MESSAGE BEFORE 
THE METAL AROUND THE AIR VENT BY THE DRIVER WINDOW CREATES A REFLECTION IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR IT CAN BE PRETTY DISTRACTING WHEN USING THE MIRROR LOVE THAT THE WIPERS WILL AUTOMATICALLY TURN ON BUT THEY ARE NOISY WHEN GOING FAST 
THE METHOD OF DATA ENTRY FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DESTINATION ADDRESS ENTRY NEEDS TO BE RADICALLY IMPROVED THE CURRENT USER INTERFACE FOR THE NAV SYSTEM S DATA ENTRY IS ARCHAIC AND IT IS NEARLY UNUSABLE IN FACT MY WIFE WILL NEVER FIGURE O 
THE MIC FOR THE PHONE CALLS DOESN T SEEM WELL PLACED PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING ME 
THE MIC HAD TO BE REPLACED SOUND IS STILL NOT THAT WELL 
THE MIC IN PHONE CALLS IS REALLY AWFUL AND THE FACT THAT HONDA IS MARRIED WITH APPLE EVEN THEY ARE NEAR A 10% OF THE MARKET AGAINST ANDROID S 80% MAKE IT RIDICULOUS TO CONTINUE INSISTING ON ONLY APPLE DEVICES CAN CONNECT TO USB 
THE MIC QUALITY FOR BLUTOOTH PHONE CALLS 
THE MICROPHONE IS NOT VERY SENSITIVE DURING A CALL THE RECIPIENT HEARS A LOT OF BACKGROUND NOISE AND THE CALLER SOUNDS DISTANT 
THE MICROPHONE IS VERY SENSITIVE AND MY WIFE TALKS LOUD SO IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS YELLING WHEN USING IT 
THE MICROPHONE PICKS UP MY VOICE EXTREMELY WELL MANY PEOPLE I HAVE TALKED WITH USING IT DID NOT EVEN REALIZE I WAS SPEAKING TO THEM OVER BLUETOOTH 
THE MICROPHONE USED FOR MAKING PHONE CALLS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED I FEEL I MUST SHOUT TO BE HEARD WHILE SPEAKING ON THE PHONE 
THE MID ENGINE MAKES REAR VISION DIFFICULT USE THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS AND CAMERA A LOT! IT IS WORTH THE INCONVENIENCE FOR THE GREAT HANDLING AND STEERING
THE MID RANGE SOUND OF THE SPEAKERS NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
THE MIDDLE HEAD REST IN THE SECOND ROW SHOULD BE REMOVABLE SO THAT YOU HAVE A BETTER VIEW WITH REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THE MIDDLE HEADREST IN THE BACK SEAT BLOCKS SOME REAR VISIBILITY
THE MIKE CONTROLS I AM NOT SURE IF PEOPLE CAN HEAR ME WELL I WISH I COUDL SEE THE LEVELS BETTER 
THE MILES PER GALLON
THE MINI CONNECTED APPLICATION IS FRAUGHT WITH GLITCHES IT IS EXTREMELY AGGRAVATING TO USE 
THE MINI HAS NO LEAST FAVORITE 
THE MINI IS A FUN AND FUNCTIONAL VEHICLE 
THE MINI NEEDS MORE FEATURES SUCH AS AIR CONDITION SEATS BLIND SPOT DETECTION ELECTRIC SEATS NOT MANUAL 
THE MIRROR DIMMERS ARE AWESOME 
THE MIRROR SEEMS TO BE IN THE WAY WHEN TURNING LEFT 
THE MIRROR SENSORS COMPENSATE FOR THE BLIND SPOTS 
THE MIRROR WITHIN A MIRROR IS MOST HELPFUL 
THE MIRRORLINK OR STARLINK SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND DOES NOT WORK EVEN WITH APP DOWNLOADED TO DEVICE IT CONTINUALLY GIVES ERROR THAT APP NEEDS TO BE DOWNLOADED 
THE MIRRORS AND SUPPORT FOR THE ROOF/WINDSHIELD CREATE A GIANT BLIND SPOT ON EACH SIDE OF THE DRIVERS VISION
THE MIRRORS ARE LOCATED ON THE DOORS AND THIS ELIMINATES SOME POTENTIAL BLIND SPOTS I REALLY LIKE THIS FEATURE 
THE MIRRORS ARE NICE HOWEVER THE IN MIRROR SIGNALS ARE A LITTLE BLINDING AT NIGHT WHEN SIGNALING FOR A TURN THE MIRRORS ALSO BLOCK ONE S VISION WHEN TRYING TO LOOK LEFT OR RIGHT BEFORE TURNING 
THE MIRRORS ARE SLANTED DOWNWARDS INSTEAD OF LEVELLED
THE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL
THE MIRRORS ARE VERY SMALL I HAVE A HARD TIME CHANGING LANES I FEEL THE CAR COULD BE IMPROVED IN THIS ASPECT SINCE THE CAR FEELS SOLID BUT THERE IS THIS FEELING OR HESITATION BEFORE I CHANGE LANES THAT I DO NOT LIKE 
THE MIRRORS ARE WONDERFUL 
THE MIRRORS SEEM TO CREATE BLINDSPOT WHEN TURNING
THE MISSING ITEM THAT WERE MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE SURVEY 
THE MKX IS A FEW INCHES WIDER THAT MY 09 MERCURY MARINER I HAVE TROUBLE MANUVERING IT IN/OUT OF GARAGE THAT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SPACES I ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE DRIVER MIRROR A BIT IT BENT BACKWARDS AND GOT LOOSE I D ONLY HAD THE CAR TWO MON 
THE MKX NEEDS BIGGER MIRRORS WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR IT WOULD BE A BIGGER ISSUE THAN IT IS THE MIRRORS ON THE MKC ARE BIGGER THAT THE MKX THAT IS AN ISSUE
THE MMI WORKS THE BEST OF ALL VEHICLES I LOOKED AT VOICE COMMAND IS INCONSISTENT BUT THE CONTROLS ARE EASY THE MMI KNOB OPERATES COUNTER INTUITIVELY 
THE MODEL I BOUGHT NX200T DID NOT HAVE A GPS MOVING MAP NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOR AN EASY OPTION TO ADD IT 
THE MOE TIRES ARE THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK IN TERMS OF SAFETY 
THE MOLDING BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOORS CREATE A SEVERE BLIND SPOT 
THE MOLDING FROM THE REAR WINDOWS TO THE BACK WINDOWS IS TOO WIDE TAKING UP VIEWING SPACE THE VISORS ARE MORE NARROW THAN BEFORE MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT COVER THE SUN DURING EVENING DRIVING I REALLY THOUGHT THE HEAD LIGHTS WOULD BE MUCH BRIGHTER 
THE MONOCHROME LCD DISPLAY ON THE AUDIO HEAD UNIT IS DIM AND HARD TO READ IN DAYLIGHT A BRIGHTNESS OR CONTRAST CONTROL WOULD IMPROVE ITS READABILITY 
THE MOOD LIGHTS ARE HARD TO EVEN SEE NOT WORTH HAVING 
THE MORE I DRIVE THE CAR THE MORE I LIKE IT VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT AND I LIKE THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL AND LANE KEEPING SYSTEM ON A HIGHWAY 
THE MORE I USE IT THE EASIER IT BECOMES I M NOT A TECHIE!!!
THE MORE I USE IT THE MORE I LIKE IT 
THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED VOICE COMMAND SCREEN IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL WHEN ACCESSING THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
THE MOST HELPFUL WOULD BE HAVING THE CONTROLS NOT ON THE TOUCH SCREEN 
THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF MY CAR IS THE REARVIEW CAMERA FOR SAFETY NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR LOCATING INFORMATION AND AUDIO RADIO SYSTEM THE MERCEDES BENZ E CLASS IS OUTSTANDING 
THE MOST IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE IN ANY CAR IS RESPONSIVENESS THE A4 GETS AN A+ IN THAT SUBJECT 
THE MOST INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE SYSTEM WE EVER OWNED IN A CAR 
THE MOST TIME I VE SPENT IN THE CAR AT ONCE IS LESS THAN 2 HRS ! I DON T FEEL I CAN TRULY ASSESS THE SYSTEMS MENTIONED OTHER THAN THE SOUND SYSTEM IS ABOVE AVERAGE 
THE MOUSE 
THE MOUSE CAN BE HARD TO USE IT IS DIFFICULT TO LAND ON WHAT I WANT 
THE MOUSE CONTROL ON CONSOLE IS DIFFICULT TO USE YOU HAVE TO SET WHERE YOU WANT THE MOUSE ICON TO GO BUT WHEN YOU PUSH DOWN ON THE CONTROL IT OFTEN MOVES AWAY FROM WHERE YOU INTENDED TO USE IT FRUSTRATING 
THE MOUSE CONTROL SYSTEM IS HARD TO OPERATE TOO SENSITIVE
THE MOUSE CONTROLLER IS NOT GOOD I WORKED IN THE VEHICLE BUSINESS FOR MANY YEARS WORKING ON NAVIGATION AND TELEMATIC SYSTEMS WORKING FOR ALPINE SO I AM AN EXPERT IN THIS AREA IT IS NOT A GOOD INTERFACE MECHANISM 
THE MOUSE DOES NOT WORK WELL IT S DIFFICULT TO POSITION ON THE WINDOW DESIRED AS IT JUMPS AROUND AND VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL IT S DISTRACTING AND DANGEROUS AS YOU DRIVE AND TRY TO USE 
THE MOUSE IS HARD TO USE TO NAVIGATE AROUND THE SCREEN AND THE VOICE QUALITY O THE PHONE IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY 2010 WAS
THE MOUSE STYLE SYSTEM TO ACCESS THE NAVIGATION AND OTHER SYSTEMS IS IMPRECISE AND JUMPY THIS IS CLEARLY AN AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT 
THE MULTI CONTROL IS PRETTY ANNOYING TO TRY AND USE NOT SURE THAT A TOUCHPAD WOULDN T BE EASIER THOUGH THE FEEDBACK FROM THE CONTROLLER IS OFTEN HELPFUL 
THE MULTI FUNCTION NAV AUDIO BACKUP CAMERA ETC CONSOLE SCREEN HAS RELATIVELY LOW RESOLUTION ANGLES UPWARD AND HAS NO PROVISION FOR SHADING IT WASHES OUT COMPLETELY WHEN SUN HITS IT DOESN T SEEM WELL THOUGHT THROUGH 
THE MULTIPLE CHOICES ON THE AUDIO NAVIGATION SYSTEM ARE DISTRACTING WHILE TRYING TO DRIVE
THE MULTIPLE CONTROLS MAY BE OVERKILL I M NOT SURE YOU NEED CONSOLE CONTROLS IN DASH CONTROLS TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS AND STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS 
THE MULTIPLE FAVORITES MENUS ARE HARD TO GET TO ON THE SCREEN YOU HAVE TO SWIPE AT JUST THE RIGHT POINT ON THE SCREEN
THE MULTITUDE OF AUDIO CHOICES 
THE MURANO IS NOTORIOUS FOR ITS BLIND SPOTS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING DEVICE HAS REALLY HELPED WITH THAT THE ALL AROUND CAMERA SYSTEM IS SOMETHING I REALLY LIKE ALSO IT MAKES PARKING EASIER SEEING OBSTACLES AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT BEE 
THE MUSIC APPS THAT ARE PRE BUILT INTO THE MAZDA 3 ARE A BIT OUTDATED IT REALLY NEEDS SPOTIFY CONNECTIVITY IT WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS A WAY FOR THE DEALER TO UPDATE THE APPS WITHIN THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM SO THAT MODERN APPS COULD BE SUPPO 
THE MUSIC AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTS WHEN A CALL COMES IN OR I MAKE A VOICE COMMAND BUT IT DOESN T ADJUST TO THE OTHER CABIN NOISE SUCH AS WHEN ACCELERATING OR DECELERATING THE WAY MY LAST CHEVY DID IT MIGHT BE A SETTING BUT I CAN T FIND IT 
THE MUSIC SOUND QUALITY IS EXCEPTIONAL VOICE RECOGNITION AND I HAVE A MIDWESTERN ACCENT I DON T UNDERSTAND WHY IT DOES NOT
THE MUSIC SOUND SYSTEM IS CONCERT HALL QUALITY
THE MUSIC SOUNDS GREAT CAN ADJUST LEVELS TO SATISFY DIFFERENT DRIVERS DID NOT KNOW THE CD PLAYER COULD ALSO PLAY DVDS UNTIL AFTER I BOUGHT THE CAR COOL 
THE MUSIC SOUNDS INCREDIBLE
THE MYFORD TOUCH SYSTEM MAKES ACCEPTING CALLS A BREEZE WHILE DRIVING 
THE MYLINCOLN TOUCH SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY INTUITIVE TO USE AND WELL LAID OUT 
THE MYLINCOLNTOUCH SYSTEM SOMETIMES SWITCHES BETWEEN SCREENS WITHOUT PROMPTING THE SWITCH ESPECIALLY WHEN IN REVERSE AFTER THE REAR CAMERA SCREEN SWITCHES BACK TO MYLINCOLNTOUCH 
THE NAG SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND ACCESS I USE MY IPHONE WITH THE BLUE TOOTH BECAUSE IT S SO MUCH EASIER AND HAS CLEARER DIRECTIONS
THE NAG SYSTEM NEEDS A LOT OF WORK 
THE NAGIGATION IS HORRIBLE IT LOOKS UGLY SLOW AND CLUNKY 
THE NAV
THE NAV AND AUDIO SYSTEMS ARE NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY 
THE NAV AND INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM ARE A MESS TOO MANY REDUNDANT BUTTONS HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHILE DRIVING THE TLX JUST NEEDS A COMPLETE REDO ON THE UI I CAN T FIGURE OUT HOW THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC WORKS BUT I THINK IT SHOWS YOU THE MAP TR 
THE NAV APP ON MY MOBILE PHONE IS EASIER TO USE SO I DON T USE THE ONE IN THE CAR 
THE NAV CENTER FOR THIS CAR DOES NOT ALLOW FOR REAL TIME TRAFFIC INFORMATION TO BE SHOWN WHICH IS THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH IT GREAT SYSTEM BUT HUGE WEAKNESS OF SYSTEM
THE NAV DISPLAY IS TOO SMALL
THE NAV DOES NOT SHOW REAL TIME TRAFFIC YOU HAVE TO CLICK ON THE SETTINGS SCREEN AND GO INTO TO SERIOUS TO SEE IT ON A SEPARATE MAP IT IS BOGUS I WANT TO SEE REALTIME TRAFFIC AS I DRIVE 
THE NAV FUNCTION TO SELECT POINTS OF INTEREST IS TEDIOUS TO USE BY SELECTION MENU AND FUNCTION TO SELECT POI ON MAP DOES NOT WORK WELL 
THE NAV IS A LITTLE CLUNKY WITH LOTS OF BACK AND FORTH TO GET TO EXACT ADDRESSES
THE NAV IS NOT AS INTUITIVE AS OTHERS I VE USED SWITCHING BETWEEN SYSTEMS IS CONFUSING 
THE NAV IS TERRIBLE IT IS A JOKE THE SCREEN IS COVERED WITH JUNK YOU CAN T SEE THE MAP THE DISTANCE INTERVAL CONTROLS ARE ABSURD 
THE NAV ITS OLD TECHNOLOGY WELL IT SEEMS OLD SO I DONT USE IT GIVEN AMOUNT OF WORK IT TAKES 
THE NAV LADY SPEAKS OVER ANY OTHER AUDIO INCLUDING CELL PHONE CALLS THERE IS NO WAY TO QUICKLY MUTE THE NAV LADY 
THE NAV ON THE 2015 ROVER LR4 IS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT WHICH WAS IN MY LR4 OF 2013 AND 2011 VERSIONS 
THE NAV PROGRAM IS HARD TO NAVIGATE PUTTING IN AN ADDRESS ITS SOMETIMES LOST AND DOESN T AUTOMATICALLY GUIDE YOU THERE 
THE NAV SCREEN NEEDS TO BE MUCH BIGGER MAYBE 8 INCH LIKE AND THE RED DISPLAY UP ABOVE NEEDS TO GO TO MUCH 70 S LOOK 
THE NAV SCREEN SHOULD BE LARGER ON A $40K VEHICLE IT IS WAY TOO SMALL
THE NAV SHOULD BE PART OF THE DASHBOARD NOT MOUNTED
THE NAV SYSTEM
THE NAV SYSTEM COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY I LIKE TO ZOOM AND PAN AND THIS IS DIFFICULT IN THE TOYOTA 
THE NAV SYSTEM DEFINITELY HAS SOME BUGS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT WE VE HAD TO RESORT TO PULLING OVER AND USING OUR PHONES NUMEROUS TIMES AFTER IT S GOTTEN US COMPLETELY LOST 
THE NAV SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW FOR ALTERNATE ROUTES FOR REVIEW BEFORE SETTLING OUT FOR MY DESTINATION I HAVE THIS ABILITY ON MY APPLE DEVICES AND FIND IT VERY HELPFUL FOR USE IN THE CITY 
THE NAV SYSTEM DOES NOT PROVIDE TEXT THE NAME OF THE STREET YOU RE ON NOR THE TOWNSHIP YOU RE IN IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF THE DIRECTION OF THE NEXT TURN IS PROVIDED SOONER EVEN BETTER IF THE NEXT TWO TURNS DISTANCE AND DIRECTION WAS DISPLAYED 
THE NAV SYSTEM DOES NOT STORE FAVORITES ONLY HOME 
THE NAV SYSTEM DOESN T LIKE ADDRESSES THAT CONTAIN LETTERS AND NUMBERS W87 S1357 PROVIDENCE CT AS A RESULT IS BECOMES LESS EFFECTIVE 
THE NAV SYSTEM DOESN T REALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS AND OFTEN TIMES SENDS ME ON SLOWER ROUTES I TYPICALLY USE WAZE FOR MY NAVIGATION NEEDS 
THE NAV SYSTEM DOESN T WORK FOR SQUAT WITH REGARDS TO ENTERING/REQUESTING A DESTINATION SO WE USE OUR MOBILE PHONE SYSTEMS INSTEAD 
THE NAV SYSTEM FREEZES UP OR FAILS TO SHOW/ALLOW POSSIBLE CONTROLS LIKE SETTINGS OR FIND ADDRESS
THE NAV SYSTEM HAS ISSUES WITH THE ADDRESS PORTION
THE NAV SYSTEM HAS NOT WORKED FOR THE LAST 5 WEEKS NO REPLACEMENT PARTS
THE NAV SYSTEM IS A PAIN IN THE ASS NOT ONE TENTH THE USEABILITY OF MY GARMIN NUVI 3790T IT IS WAY OVER COMPLICATED AND OF COURSE NOT USABLE WHILE MOVING GET THE GD BOOK OUT AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW AND WHY THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS REAL NICE 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS A PAIN IN THE NECK TO OPERATE 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND HIGHLY VERSATILE COMPLETELY REPLACED MY IPHONE 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS FRUSTRATING DOESN T ALLOW YOU TO INPUT ADDRESSES WHILE MOVING EVEN IF IT S THE PASSENGER ENTERING IT THE AUDIO SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO ACCESS MY AUDIO FILES ON MY SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 VERY WELL 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS GENERALLY SPOT ON I LIKE THE DRIVER S MFI DISPLAY THAT SHOWS A BAR INDICATING THE REMAINING DISTANCE TO THE TURN/EXIT POINT IN AN AREA WITH SHORT BLOCKS AND COMPLEX INTERSECTIONS THE FEATURE IS VERY HANDY 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS GROSSLY INFERIOR IT HAS THE FEEL OF 2005 TECHNOLOGY AND IS POOR COMPARED TO A 5 YEAR OLD LINCOLN WE OWN THE LINCOLN HAS SLIGHTLY MORE USER FRIENDLY VOICE COMMANDS MICROSOFT SYNC THESE SEEM TO BE CHEAP IMITATIONS OF THE REAL 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE WITH VOICE ENTRY THE PHONE SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND PROVIDES BOTH MESSAGING & CALLS BUT ALL ARE USED MANUALLY INSTEAD OF VOICE THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS USED MANUALLY BECAUSE THE VOICE SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE THE 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS JUST REALLY DISAPPOINTING THE SCREEN IS NOT SHARP AND I DO NOT BELIEVE IT HAS THE MOST CURRENT MAP UPDATES IN IT
THE NAV SYSTEM IS LESS THEN USEABLE HORRIBLE SET UP NO FAVORITES SECTION VERY DIFFICULT TO INPUT INFORMATION
THE NAV SYSTEM IS PROBABLY FINE I M JUST NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH IT AS I COULD BE
THE NAV SYSTEM IS SLOW AND CUMBERSOME TO PROGRAM SO I NEVER USE IT GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE IS SO MUCH FASTER 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS SUB PAR GOOGLE NAV IS 100% FASTER MORE ACCURATE AND EASIER TO USE 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE I WISH I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THE CAR WITHOUT IT UNBUNDLE THE NAV SYSTEM I FEEL LIKE I WASTED MONEY BUYING IT THIS WILL IMPACT FUTURE BUYING DECISIONS THE NAV SYSTEM IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE AND A $100 GARMIN PORTAB 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS VERY POOR I OFTEN USE MY CELL PHONE AND GOOGLE MAPS TO AVOID THE NAV SYSTEMS ISSUES 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS VERY POOR IN UNDERSTANDING COMMANDS 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS VOICE ONLY WHEN IN MOTION TOO TIME CONSUMING THE PASSENGER SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM MANUALLY 
THE NAV SYSTEM IS WHAT NEEDS WORK IN BEING MORE SPECIFIC 
THE NAV SYSTEM ISN T AS GOOD AS THE ONE WE HAD ON OUR FLEX IT TAKES YOU THE WRONG WAY MANY TIMES AND SOMETIMES DOESNT HAVE ADDRESSES WE VE HAD TO USE OUR IPADS TO FIND PLACES WHILE IN THE CAR SEARCHING FOR PLACES ALSO THE WAY IT GIVES YOU A 
THE NAV SYSTEM ISN T THE MOST INTUITIVE ONE THAT I VE USED 
THE NAV SYSTEM SEEMS STRAIGHT FROM 1995 ITS VERY AWKARD TO USE AND THE ROUTES IT PICKS ARE QUESTIONABLE ALSO IT S SLOW WHEN I MISS A TURN IT WANTS ME TO TAKE THE NEXT ONE IT S SO SLOW I PASS THE NEXT ONE BEFORE IT FINISHES RECALCULATING 
THE NAV SYSTEM SHOULD BE UPDATED WHEN YOU BY THE VEHICLE I WAS TOLD THE LAST TIME THE NAV NEW STREETS WERE UPDATED WAS 2012 I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THE FIRST UPDATE WHEN IT FINALLY COMES OUT 
THE NAV SYSTEM SHOULD OFFER SOME SHORT CUTS WHEN ASKING FOR INFO ABOUT GIVING A DIRECTION 
THE NAV SYSTEM USES OUTDATED MAPS IT COSTS AROUND $300 TO UPDATE UPDATES ARE ONLY YEARLY UP DATES ARE ALREADY OUT OF DATE WHEN YOU GET IT 
THE NAV SYSTEM VOICE COMMANDS ARE TOUCHY AND THE SYSTEM IS NOT AS EASY TO USE AS A SMART PHONE 
THE NAV SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL GREAT MAP LARGE SCREEN I LOVE IT!
THE NAV UNIT IS THE WEAK SISTER I D HAVE PAID FOR A BETTER ONE 
THE NAV VOICE RECOGNITION IS A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT
THE NAV VOICE RECOGNITION IS HARD TO USE
THE NAV WORKS FLAWLESSLY
THE NAV/RADIO REBOOTS AT APPROXIMATELY 3 4 HOURS IN USE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WITH DEALER WHEN OWNING PREVIOUS COUNTRYMAN THEY TRADED US TO THE COUNTRYMAN WE RE IN NOW AFTER CHANGING THE RADIO IN THE OTHER CAR FOUR TIMES THE SAME PROB 
THE NAVAGATION SYSTEM GIVES TOO MUCH DETAIL AND INSTRUCTION SOMETIMES YOU JUST SAY THE WRONG NAME AND SHE GIVES YOU A COMPLETE DISORTATION ON THE SYSTEM THIRTY OPTIONS JUST SAY REPEAT YOU DON T NEED THAT KIND OF INSTRUCTION EVERYTIME YOU MAKE A 
THE NAVAGATION SYSTEM IS AWESOME BEING ABLE TO DO ROUTING BY VOICE COMANDS IS GREAT THE BOSE SYSTEM IS ALSO GREAT
THE NAVAGATIOON SYSTEM DOES NOT WARN YOU AT ENOUGH TIME THAT YOUR TURN IS UPON YOU 
THE NAVI IS HARD TO USE TOO MANY THINGS ON THE SCREEN THE VOICE IS ALWAYS ON WITH TRAFFIC INFO THAT IT BECOMES DISTRACTING 
THE NAVIGATION
THE NAVIGATION 
THE NAVIGATION ALPHABET WHEEL ENTRY IS TERRIBLE! AND VOICE RECOGNITION IS ONLY GOOD FOR TELLING IT TO GO TO A PREVIOUS DESTINATION 
THE NAVIGATION ALTHOUGH TIME CONSUMING SOMETIMES TO SET THE NAVIGATION FOR TRIP ROUTING ONCE THE SYSTEM IS SET IT DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OF GETTING YOU TO YOUR DESTINATION IT ALSO CORRECTS MISTAKES VERY QUICKLY SUCH AS WRONG TURNS AND MISSED ST 
THE NAVIGATION AND AUDIO SYSTEM ARE BEYOND EXCELLENT!
THE NAVIGATION AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
THE NAVIGATION AND MAPPING FROM THE CAR IS DIFFICULT DOING IT FROM MBRACE IS GREAT!
THE NAVIGATION AND PHONE COMMANDS ARE CLUNKY AND REQUIRE MUCH MORE INPUT THAN OTHER CARS REQUIRE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ESPECIALLY CLUNKY IN THE WAY THAT IT MAKES YOU INPUT AN ADDRESS 
THE NAVIGATION AND THE DISPLAY CAN USE HIGHER RESOLUTION MORE APPEALING GRAPHICS 
THE NAVIGATION APP AND BLUETOOTH CALL QUALITY I MENTIONED BEFORE 
THE NAVIGATION AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS SURVEY IT HAS ISSUES AND NEEDS MAJOR IMPROVEMENT ALL AROUND I EXPECTED MORE IN THIS AREA FROM A CAR MADE BY BMW 
THE NAVIGATION AUTO PREDICTION MAKES FOR AN AGGRAVATING INPUT NEVER HAVING THE OPTIONS I WANT SO I USUALLY JUST USE THE MAPS APP FUNCTION ON MY ANDROID SMART PHONE IF I NEED HELP GOING WHERE I M GOING I LL PUT THE MAP ON MY SCREEN IF I M TRYING 
THE NAVIGATION CANNOT BE USED WHEN DRIVING YOU CAN T INPUT ANYTHING WHICH IS REALLY INCONVENIENT WHEN THE PASSENGER IS TRYING TO FIND A SPECIFIC PLACE WHILE YOU DRIVE 
THE NAVIGATION COMMUNICATION SCREEN LOOKS LIKE IT WAS AN AFTER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE BUILT IN TO THE DASH BETTER OR TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CLOSE IT WHEN NOT IN USE 
THE NAVIGATION COMPARED TO GOOGLE MAPS ON OUR PHONES IS AVERAGE OR LESS THEN AVERAGE AT BEST MANY UNIQUE CHICAGO ADDRESSES ARE NOT IN THE DATABASE 
THE NAVIGATION COULD ACTUALLY WORK 
THE NAVIGATION COULD BE BETTER IT GAVE ME A CRAZY ROUTE WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH HOLLYWOOD AND DOWN TO IRVINE I USE MY WAZE APPLICATION ON MY CELL PHONE INSTEAD OF THE BRZ S NAVIGATION INSTEAD THE BRZ S NAVIGATION SEEMS TO FAVOR CITY STREE 
THE NAVIGATION COULD BE MORE ACCURATE AND VOICE COMMANDS ARE NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE 
THE NAVIGATION COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENT GOOGLE MAPS IS ABLE TO PROVIDE A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATED TRIP LENGTH RIGHT OFF THE BAT WHEREAS THIS BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM OVERESTIMATES THE TIME INITIALLY AND ONLY BECOMES ACCURATE ABOUT 75% 
THE NAVIGATION DASHBOARD IS TOO SMALL AND NEEDS TO BE BIGGER ALSO THE DISPLAY COULD BE A LOT MORE ATTRACTIVE 
THE NAVIGATION DESTINATION IS NOT CLEAR ENOUGH TO COMPARE WITH THE GARMIN BECAUSE WHEN I REACH MY DESTINATION I DON T KNOW IT IS IN MY LEFT HAND SIDE OR RIGHT HAND SIDE THE VOLVO NAVIGATION NEVER TELLS ME 
THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY AND FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT USER FRIENDLY SCREEN IS SMALLER THAN DESIRED TOO 
THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY IS IN THE DIAL AREA LEAVING THE LARGER SCREEN FOR ENTERTAINMENT USE 
THE NAVIGATION DOES NOT UNDERSTAND CLEARLY STATED COMMANDS
THE NAVIGATION DOESN T ALWAYS WORK AS EXPECTED FOR EXAMPLE MY DESTINATION WILL BE 1000 AHEAD ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STREET AND THE NAVIGATION WILL TELL ME TO TURN RIGHT AND CIRCLE AROUND THE BLOCK 
THE NAVIGATION DOESN T RESPOND AND DOES NOT LOCATE ADDRESSES 
THE NAVIGATION FEATURES ARE STILL PRETTY BAD IN COMPARISON TO GOOGLE MAPS AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM REROUTES ARE NOT AS GOOD AS GOOGLE S TRAFFIC CONDITIONS NOT AS ACCURATE AS GOOGLE S VEHICLE S NAV WILL SHOW GREEN WHEN MOVING AT BELOW MINIMUM PO 
THE NAVIGATION FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE CERTAIN ADDRESSES THAT MY GOOGLE MAPS CAN 
THE NAVIGATION FUNCTION IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE WAZE APP I USE THE PHONE APP INSTEAD OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THERE ARE NO REAL TIME TRAFFIC WORKAROUNDS ONLY VERY BASIC DESTINATION ROUTS INEFFICIENT IN FUNCTIONING WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH BETTER 
THE NAVIGATION GRAPHICS SHOULD BE BETTER THE AUDIO SPEAKERS ARE HORRIBLE AND SO ARE THE APPS 
THE NAVIGATION GUIDANCE IS SOMETIMES DELAYED ON WHERE TO GO OFTEN FIND THAT WHEN IT TELLS ME LATE IN THE ROUTE AND I HAVE TO MAKE A QUICK ADJUSTMENT ON MY ROUTE WHICH IS A SAFETY HAZARD 
THE NAVIGATION HAS PROVED TO BE VERY ACCURATE AND DEPENDABLE IT TELLS YOU WHAT TIME YOU WILL ARRIVE AT YOUR DESTINATION AND IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND EVEN INTERRUPTS YOU TO TELL YOU WHEN YOU ARE LOW ON GAS AND WOULD YOU LIKE IT TO DIRECT YOU TO 
THE NAVIGATION HAS TO BE BETTER AT RECOGNIZING MULTIPLE NAMES FOR THE SAME ROAD 
THE NAVIGATION I WISH THE 8 4A AND 8 4AN CAN BE INTERCHANGED SO WHEN THE DEALER LIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS AND THEN DON T DELIVER IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR THE CUSTOMERS TO MAKE THE DEALERS KEEP THEIR WORD AND GIVE US THE SYSTEM WE WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE
THE NAVIGATION INTERFACE MAKE IT MORE GARMIN LIKE OR GOOGLE MAPS LIKE MAKE THE SYSTEM EASIER TO QUICKLY ENTER AN ADDRESS 
THE NAVIGATION INTERFACE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO GET GOING WITH FEWER STEPS I HAVE USED SEVERAL WINDSHIELD MOUNT GARMIN PRODUCTS THAT DO THIS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL ALSO NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE SONGS WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH FIVE STEPS BECAUSE YO 
THE NAVIGATION IS A LITTLE AWKWARD THE ARROW MOVES AND IT HARD TO SEE WHAT DIRECTION YOU ARE TRAVELING AT TIMES THE ARROW INDICATOR POINTS DOWN AND LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED TO MAKE A RIGHT BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE A LEFT CAN BE CONFUSING WHEN DRIVING 
THE NAVIGATION IS A LITTLE FUSSY BOTH WITH TOUCH SCREEN AND VOICE ACTIVATION 
THE NAVIGATION IS CLUNKY THE SCREEN DOESN T DISPLAY AUDIO INFORMATION CONSISTENTLY THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION TO TURN OFF THE SETTING THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM CHANGING SOME AUDIO FEATURES WHILE IN MOTION BECAUSE EVEN THE PASSENGER IS NOT ABLE TO C 
THE NAVIGATION IS CONFUSING AT TIMES AND DIFFICULT TO CHANGE 
THE NAVIGATION IS DELAYED AND APPEARS VERY 2 DIMENSIONAL THE ENTIRE INTERFACE SEEMS VERY BEHIND ON TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY SINCE IT CAN T EVEN GET SATELLITE RADIO UNLESS I TAKE IT IN TO PAY MORE TO ADD IT ON PAYING EXTRA TO HAVE NAVIGATION AND BO 
THE NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND IS NOT INTUITIVE I HAVE EVEN WATCHED THE ONLINE VIDEOS ON HOW TO WORK IT AND STILL CANNOT GET IT TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY 
THE NAVIGATION IS HARD TO READ I THINK SO GIVING VOICE AND VISUAL COMMANDS SOONER WOULD BE HELPFUL 
THE NAVIGATION IS HARD TO USE
THE NAVIGATION IS JUST BAD AND EXPENSIVE 
THE NAVIGATION IS LACKLUSTER BUT OTHER THEN THAT IT GREAT
THE NAVIGATION IS NOT SIMPLE TO USE I STRUGGLE WITH THIS FEATURE IT WILL BE SIMPLER WHEN USED MORE OFTEN BUT ITS HARDER TO PROGRAM THAN IN MY LAST VEHICLE A PRIUS 
THE NAVIGATION IS NOT THE EASIEST TO USE IT IS SLOW TO RESPOND TO VERBAL COMMANDS AND OFTEN MISUNDERSTANDS RESPONDING WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT RESPONSE PERHAPS A DIFFERENT NAVIGATION SYSTEM LIKE A GARMIN WOULD IMPROVE THINGS 
THE NAVIGATION IS NOT USER FRIENDLY I VE HAD SEVERAL S CLASS MERCEDES AND THEY ALL HAVE HAD THE SAME NAVIGATION MERCEDES NEEDS TO ADD A TOUCH FEATURE TO THE NAVIGATION 
THE NAVIGATION IS ONLY TURN BY TURN NO MAPS AT ALL AND IS TOTALLY DEPENDANT ON EXSPENSIVE ONSTAR SUBSCRIPTION! THE OTHER SYSTEMS ARE VERY CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT TO USE ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING! ALL THAT TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE GREAT AT HOME 
THE NAVIGATION IS OUT OF DATE FOR A 2015 VEHICLE IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE MY STREET AND HOW TO GET THERE AND MY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN HERE FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS 
THE NAVIGATION IS POORLY DESIGN THOUGH SCREEN IS NICE THE SCREEN SHOULD BE FURTHER FORWARD AND CHANGED TO A TOUCH SCREEN I NEED TO SCROLL THROUGH LETTERS AND PUSH BUTTON IN ORDER TO USE THE SYSTEM I OFTEN USE MY PHONE BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG T 
THE NAVIGATION IS RIGHT ON POINT WITH DIRECTIONS THE PICTURES ARE VERY CLEAR
THE NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE
THE NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE WITH VOICE COMMANDS AND GETTING THE CORRECT STATE AND CITY IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO USE AND CANCEL CURRENT DATA INPUT 
THE NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE!
THE NAVIGATION IS THE BEST I VE SEEN EASY TO USE VIEW AND HAS TRAFFIC UPDATES 
THE NAVIGATION IS THE WEAK POINT FOR SURE I HAVE USED IT A FEW TIMES AND THE ROUTES IT HAS PROVIDED WERE COMPLETELY INACCURATE HOPEFULLY GM WILL COME UP WITH AN UPDATE FOR THE NAV SYSTEM I USE THE GPS/NAVIGATION ON MY IPHONE STILL IT S MUCH MOR 
THE NAVIGATION IS TO HARD TO USE OR FIGURE OUT 
THE NAVIGATION IS TOO DIFFICULT TO USE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE TRAFFIC ALERTS AND THE DIRECTIONS ARE HARD TO FOLLOW I WOULD RATHER USE MY CELL PHONE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS ITS FASTER AND EASIER TO USE 
THE NAVIGATION IS UNIMPRESSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO USE THE RESOLUTION OF THE VISUALS ARE NOT CLEAR IT S LOOKS A LITTLE CHEAP AND NON PREMIUM 
THE NAVIGATION IS VERY EASY TO USE AND BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS 2007 S8 WHICH I HAD
THE NAVIGATION LADY WOULD UNDERSTAND ME BETTER
THE NAVIGATION MAP IS EASY TO SEE AND I LOVE THE CAR ICON SHOWING ME WHERE I AM 
THE NAVIGATION MAP IS UGLY AND OUT OF DATE I EXPECTED MORE FROM A $40K VEHICLE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM SOMETIMES DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MY VOICE I M AWARE THAT IT NEEDS TO LEARN HOW I SAY THINGS BUT AT TIMES IT CAN BE A BIT FRUSTRATING I HA 
THE NAVIGATION MENU IS HARD TO NAVIGATE 
THE NAVIGATION NEEDS A QWERTY KEYBOARD INSTEAD OF THE SCROLL THROUGH THE LETTERS APPROACH 
THE NAVIGATION NEEDS TO FIND MORE/BETTER POINTS OF INTEREST WHEN USING THE VOICE COMMAND 
THE NAVIGATION NEEDS WORK ON THE ROUTING AND MAP COUNTY ROADS 
THE NAVIGATION ON THE STEERING WHEEL IS EASY TO USE AND I HARDLY HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD WHEN I NEED TO SWITCH A STATION 
THE NAVIGATION ONLY WORKS SOMETIMES AND IS NOT EASY TO ENTER INFO GM SHOULD TEAM UP WITH A LARGE MAP FIRM TO CREATE AN EASIER USER INTERFACE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO HAVE PEOPLE USE ON STAR PHONE CONNECTIVITY FOR MAPS COULD WORK WELL ALSO WAITING F 
THE NAVIGATION PLACE NAMES ARE OFTEN WRONG IT DOES NOT FIND WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR AND WILL TRY TO GUIDE ME TO A LOCATION ON THE OPPOSITE COAST OF THE COUNTRY 
THE NAVIGATION ROUTE DOESN T GIVE YOU THE BEST ROUTE TO TAKE APPS LIKE WAZE DOES A BETTER JOB I ALSO HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THE NEAREST GAS STATION MY GAS WAS ALMOST EMPTY AND THE SYSTEM SUGGESTED ONE AFTER GETTING BACK ON THE FREEWAY WHEN I S 
THE NAVIGATION ROUTE GUIDANCE IS REALLY WEIRD I BELIEVE IT IS CALIBRATED TO MAKE YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO USE LARGER HIGHWAYS AND BECAUSE I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA IT IS TAKING SOME TIME FOR IT TO LEARN THE ROUTES I USE THE LEARNING FEATURE IS GR 
THE NAVIGATION S ADDRESS METHODOLOGY IS CUMBERSOME 
THE NAVIGATION S TOUCH SCREEN IS SIMPLE TO USE ESPECIALLY THE POINTS OF INTEREST NEAR CURRENT POSITION
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN COULD BE BIGGER LIKE THE ONE IN MY 2013 GS350 
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN COULD BE LARGER THE SIZE OF CHRYSLER PRODUCTS THE NAVIGATION SCREEN SHOULD BE BUILT INTO THE DASH INSTEAD OF LOOKING LIKE AN AFTER THOUGHT 
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS DOWNRIGHT UGLY 
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE WHICH IS FINE HOWEVER IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GO DOWN WHEN NOT BEING USED 
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS FANTASTIC AND THE SIZE IS GREAT!
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS HARD TO SEE WHEN IT IS LIGHT OUT AND ESPECIALLY WHEN SUNNY 
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS SMALL FOR ME
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS VERY BUSY IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO READ A TURN BY TURN LIST AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE ALTERNATE ROUTES WOULD BE HELPFUL 
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS WHAT I LIKE THE MOST IT IS VISIBLE IN BRIGHT DAYLIGHT CONDITIONS AT ANY ANGLE OF THE SUNLIGHT AFTERMARKET GPS DEVISES DO NOT PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF VISIBILITY YOU MUST CONSTANTLY TILT THE SCREEN TO COMPENSATE FOR GLARE 
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN NEEDS TO BE LARGER EXAMPLE TESLA SCREENS MORE TOUCH SCREEN AND LESS BUTTON
THE NAVIGATION SEARCH FEATURE MAP AND LACK OF SHOWING CURRENT SPEED LIMIT MY AFTERMARKET GARMIN IS BETTER 
THE NAVIGATION SEEMS OFF TAKES AWKWARD ROUTES 
THE NAVIGATION SERVICE IS NOT VERY INFORMATIVE MAP OF STREETS COULD BE BETTER 
THE NAVIGATION SHOULD BE UPDATED AT PURCHASE AND ABLE TO UPDATE PER GOOGLE MAPS THE SOUND SYSTEM IS O K MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE HAD BOSE PREMIUM SOUND THAT IS DIFFICULT TO COMPETE WITH VOICE RECOGNITION ANSWERING CALLS WOULD BE CONVENIENT TH 
THE NAVIGATION SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT SIDE OF THE STREET YOUR DESTINATION IS I TURN OFF THE AUDIO AND JUST LOOK AT THE HEADS UP DISPLAY IT SHOULD HAVE AN ARROW OR STATE WHAT SIDE OF THE STREET ITS ON SPEAKERS ARE NOT THAT GREAT HAVE TO TURN UP 
THE NAVIGATION SOFTWARE COULD BE MADE MORE INTUITIVE TO USE 
THE NAVIGATION STILL FEELS BEHIND HE TIMES IT IS FINE FOR GUIDED NAVIGATION BUT IF JUST USING AS A MAP THE OVERALL USE OF SCREEN SIZE IS NOT OPTIMIZED AND ZOOM IN AND OUT IS VERY CLUNKY PLEASE REFERENCE THE BMW NAVIGATION EASY TO USE AND AMAZI 
THE NAVIGATION SUCKS I EXPLAINED WHY IN THE THINGS GONE WRONG 
THE NAVIGATION SUCKS IT FEELS LIKE THE CAR IS OLDER THAN 2015 THE DIRECTIONS ARE NOT VERY CLEAR IT DOESNT SHOW YOU MUTIPLE WAYS TO GET TO YOUR DESTINATION THE TIME DOESNT THINK OF TRAFFIC YOU CANT MOVE THE MAP AROUND AND LOOK FOR POI IN THE MAP
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM

THE NEW 2015 HEADLIGHTS ARE GREAT THEY GIVE A WIDE RANGE AND A GOOD DISTANCE OF VISIBILITY I FEEL LIKE I COULD SEE A PEDESTRIAN OR DOG ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD MUCH BETTER IN THE 2015 
THE NEW AUDIO SYSTEM IS A GREAT FEATURE FOR THE NEW F 150 DUE TO THE SLEEK TOUCH SCREEN AND VOICE COMMANDS THAT ALLOW YOU TO BE HANDS FREE THIS WASN T WHAT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FOR A TRUCK TO HAVE DESIGNED INTO IT AN I FEEL IT IS A GREAT ADDITIO 
THE NEW BLIND SPOT SAFETY FEATURE IS A WONDERFUL NEW ADDITION 
THE NEW BURRMEISTER SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING THE BEST CAR AUDIO I HAVE EVER HEARD 
THE NEW COLORS ARE HARDER TO SEE
THE NEW DESIGN IS INCREDIBLE HUGE UPGRADE FROM LAST BODY STYLE WELL DONE CHEVY PLEASE ALLOW ME OR A PASSENGER THOUGH TO UPDATE ADDRESSES IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING IT IS TRULY A NUISANCE ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS IN T 
THE NEW HEADLIGHTS ARE ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL 
THE NEW HIGH BELT LINE DESIGN OF ALL NEW VEHICLES HAS MADE THEM LESS SAFE TO DRIVE BECAUSE OF POOR VISIBILITY 
THE NEW HONDA MINIVAN PHONE/SYNC SYSTEM IS WAAAAAY BETTER 
THE NEW JAG DOESN T HAVE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY FOUND IN LOWER PRICED VEHICLES FORDS SPECIFICALLY WE WERE TOLD OURS HAD INTERNET CAPABILITY THROUGH A JAG APP IT DOES NOT I CAN T LISTEN TO PANDORA OR PLUG IN MY IPAD OR IPHONE ONLY MY IPOD I 
THE NEW LED HEADLIGHTS ARE THE FINEST I VE SEEN THE LIGHT OUTPUT IS EXCEPTIONAL THE REAL LED TAIL LIGHTS ARE REALLY BRIGHT AND CAN BEEN SEEN VERY FAR AWAY THERE S NO REASON FOR SOMEONE TO SAY THEY DIDN T SEE YOUR TURN SIGNAL ON 
THE NEW LEXUS MODELS USE A TOUCH PAD TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE AUDIO MEDIA NAVIGATION COMMANDS WITH NO TOUCH SCREEN OPTION DUE TO THE SENITIVITY IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TO USE WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON MAKING S 
THE NEW MIRRORS SUCK THEY ANGLED THE LOWER INSIDE OF THE MIRROR AND NOW YOU HAVE NO VIEW OF WHAT IS LOW AND CLOSE TO THE TRUCK 
THE NEW MOUSE ON THE CONSOLE IS HORRIBLE!
THE NEW ROGUE IS MUCH MORE STABLE THAN THE 2012 ROGUE DROVE ACROSS COUNTRY AND THE ROGUE WAS A DREAM TO DRIVE THROUGH ALL TYPES OF WEATHER THE WIND DID NOT SEEM TO IMPACT THE TRACKING 
THE NEW SAFETY OPTIONS IN THIS VEHICLE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE A MUST IN ALL CARS ON THE ROAD 
THE NEW SPEED CONTROL AND AUTO BRAKING W/ THE EYE SIGHT IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL AND GIVE CONFIDENCE OF SAFETY
THE NEW TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT LESS USEFUL AND MORE DISTRACTING 
THE NEW TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM IS A MUCH WELCOME IMPROVEMENT OVER THE ONE IN MY OLDER 2008 SUBARU IMPREZA 
THE NEW TREND IN REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY IN MANY MAKES OF VEHICLES ISN T GREAT ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED WITH SAY AN EARLY 2000 SUBARU FORESTER OR THE LIKE BUT YOU LEARN TO ADAPT AND YOU GAIN THE MPG I DO ACTUALLY FEEL QUITE SAFE IN MY 2015 PR 
THE NEW X5 INSTALLED A SMALLER SIDE WINDOW HARD TO SEE OUTSIDE/BACK I LIKED THE BIGGER SIDE WINDOW IN MY LAST X5 WHOSE VISIBILITY WAS GOOD PLEASE MAKE A BIG SIDE WINDOW X5 IS BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE A BIGGER WINDOW 
THE NEWEST ROADS DON T SEEM TO BE IN THE NAVIGATION AND NAVIGATION DOESN T SEEM TO WORK WHILE DRIVING AS IF A PASSENGER WAS TO ENTER THE INFORMATION THE AUDIO/COMMUNICATION SOMETIMES DOESN T RECOGNIZE MY VOICE OR COMMAND 
THE NEXT SONG CONTROL FROM STEERING WHEEL DOESN T ALWAYS WORK SPEAKERS AREN T THE BEST SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO PAIR BLUETOOTH WITH CAR 
THE NICE AND CRISP SOUND 
THE NIGHT VISION IS SUPER HELPFUL 
THE NISSAN APP IS A JOKE AND DOESN T WORK IN FACT MY PANDORA QUIT DISPLAYING THE AUTHOR TITLE AND TRACK INFO UNTIL I DELETED THE APP I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE REVIEWS AND NOT WASTED MY TIME TRYING IT OUT 
THE NISSAN APP IS DIFFICULT TO CONNECT TO DEVICES CAN T GET THE IPOD TO CONNECT ALL THE WAY SO HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES FROM THE ROAD TO CHANGE MUSIC
THE NISSAN APP IS ESSENTIALLY USELESS AS I DON T USE PANDORA IHEARTRADIO ETC AS WELL WHY ON EARTH WOULD I WANT FACEBOOK CONNECTIVITY IN MY CAR MY CAR IS THE SWEET ZEN LIKE ESCAPE FROM A WORLD SATURATED BY SOCIAL MEDIA NONSENSE NOTE I M A 29 
THE NISSAN APP IS HORRIBLE I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT TO PANDORA OR IHEART I HAVE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS SEVERAL TIME AND HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK
THE NISSAN APP NEEDS IMPROVED ON
THE NISSAN APPS HAS NOT WORKED SMOOTHLY FROM THE DAY I PURCHASED IT I DO NOT HAVE MUCH INTEREST IN THAT FEATURE SO I DO NOT PARTICULARLY MIND I SUPPOSE I NEVER GET UPSET ABOUT IT BECAUSE I AM NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT I AM MISSING 
THE NISSAN APPS WORK ONLY ABOUT 75% OF THE TIME THE NAV SYSTEM GAVE WRONG ARRIVAL TIMES 
THE NISSAN AROUND VIEW CAMERA IS EXCELLENT IT IS THE BEST SYSTEM THAT I HAVE USED 
THE NISSAN CONNECT APP IS VERY HARD TO USE AND I HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING IT TO WORK 
THE NISSAN CONNECT APP NEEDS WORK FOR EASE OF USE AND INTEGRATION TO AUDIO SYSTEM WOULD LIKE USE OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM IF PASSENGER SEAT IS OCCUPIED IF NOT OCCUPIED MUST STOP VEHICLE TO RE ROUTE 
THE NISSAN CONNECT APPS DO NOT WORK WELL AND THERE ARE VERY FEW OF THEM IT S ALMOST A POINTLESS FEATURE 
THE NISSAN CONNECT FEATURE COULD AT LEAST WORK WITHOUT HAVING ME CALL THEM TO GET IT GOING
THE NISSAN CONNECT PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME AND UNFRIENDLY 
THE NISSAN CONNECT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK AT ALL I TRIED IT A FEW TIMES AND JUST ENDED UP FRUSTRATED I DO LIKE THE BLUETOOTH LINK TO THE IPOD ON MY PHONE THOUGH 
THE NISSANCONNECT APP IS VERY POOR I HAVE HAD TO STOP THE CAR AND RESTART EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY APPS DON T LOAD MOST OF THE TIME AND IT WILL GET STUCK ON THE LOADING SCREEN
THE NISSANCONNECT SYSTEM/APPS SEEMS TO BE A WASTE SEEMS THAT RELATIVELY FEW ARE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING MORE THAN GOOGLE SEARCH TO WORK NONE OF THE OTHER APPS WORK MAYBE THEY DO NOW BUT I HAVE ALREADY MOVED ON WITH BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY I AM N 
THE NO HANDS VOICE COMMUNICATION APP COULD BE IMPROVED 
THE NOISE FOR INCOMING PHONE CALLS IS VERY ALARMING AND SHOULD BE CHANGED OR AT LEAST CONFIGURABLE 
THE NOISE PRESENT DURING FM RADIO RECEPTION IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE YOU WOULD THINK AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY GM COULD SUPPLY AN FM RADIO THAT WORKS PROPERLY 
THE NOISE UNDERNEATH THE TRUCK 
THE NON WINDOW SPACE IN THE BLIND SPOT AREAS IS LARGE AND OBSTRUCTS THE VIEW ESPECIALLY WHEN SHIFTING LANES 
THE NUMBER AND PLACEMENT OF THE AIRBAGS IS EXCEPTIONAL EVEN OUR DOGS IN THE CARGO AREA WITH THE BACK SEATS FOLDED DOWN ARE PROTECTED 
THE NUMBER OF AUDIO OPTIONS AVAILABLE
THE NUMBER OF COMMANDS REQUIRED TO LOCATE ANYTHING IS HIGHLY REDUNDANT IT SHOULD BE NO MORE DIFFICULT TO USE THEN THE MAPPING OR NAVIGATION FEATURES FOUND ON MY SMART PHONE THIS AREA NEEDS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT JUST TO COMPETE WITH A SMART PHONE 
THE NUMBER OF FEATURES ARE GREAT AND I LOVE THE ABILITY TO USE THE APP ON MY PHONE TO SEND A DESTINATION TO THE NAV IN THE CAR IT S MUCH EASIER THAN USING THE CONTROLS IN THE CAR 
THE NUMBER OF SAFETY FEATURES IS AMAZING EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND THERE IS ANOTHER FEATURE I DIDN T REALIZE!
THE NUMEROUS OPTIONS I LIKE THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS 
THE NX FEELS LIKE A WELL CRAFTED VEHICLE WITH NUMEROUS SAFETY FEATURES THAT FEELS SOLID WHEN DRIVING 
THE ODD DELAY BETWEEN IPOD TRACKS AND THE CONSTANT NEED TO RELOAD TRACK NAMES PHONE NUMBERS ETC FROM EXTERNAL DEVICES 
THE OFFERING OF SO MANY EASY TO USE FEATURES
THE OIL NEEDED CHANGING BOLTS ON SO TIGHT NEEDED A TWO FOOT CROW BAR UNACCEPTABLE 
THE OLD FASHIONED CLOCK LOCATED IN THE DASHBOARD SHOULD BE DIGITALIZED TO CONFORM WITH HIGH TECH FEATURES ON THE REST OF THE DASHBOARD
THE OLD IMPALA VEHICLES HAD SUCH SMALL SIDE MIRRORS I AM SO GLAD THAT THEY AREN T ANYMORE THAT WAS A PROBLEM FOR ME WHILE DRIVING THE RENTALS AT TIMES 
THE OLD NAV SYSTEM USED TO LET YOU PICK THE ROUTE YOU WANTED IE FASTER OR SHORTER THE NEW NAV SYSTEM HAS NO OPTIONS 
THE OLD STYLE CADILLAC ESCALADES WERE SOOO MUCH EASIER TO SEE OUT OF VISIBILITY WITH THE THIRD ROW HEADRESTS IN PLACE IS MORE DIFFICULT WE REMOVED THEM 
THE OLDER MODELS HAD MORE GLASS AND BETTER VISIBILITY
THE ON SCREEN CONTROLS ARE TEDIOUS TO USE EVEN WITH THE MOUSE TYPE INTERFACE
THE ON SCREEN DISPLAY OF THE CONTACT INFORMATION
THE ON SCREEN KEYPAD FOR USING THE PHONE IS VERY USEFUL FOR THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER
THE ON SCREEN MENU IS GOOD BUT COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IF YOU ARE DRIVING NOT PARKED AND WANT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS 
THE ON SCREEN NOTIFICATION OF TEXT MESSAGES 
THE ON STAR SYSTEM GM USES IS POOR FOR PHONE USE
THE ON THE STEERING WHEEL RADIO CONTROLS
THE ON/OFF BUTTON FOR THE MYLINK ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS NOT IMMEDIATELY RESPONSIVE AND DOESN T PROVIDE ANY TACTILE FEEDBACK WHEN YOU PRESS IT VOLUME CONTROLS ALSO COULD BE MORE RESPONSIVE AND EVEN BETTER AUDIO BETTER BASS MORE OF A SURROUND S 
THE ON/OFF KNOB IS ALSO THE VOLUME CONTROL KNOB IT S TOO SLIPPERY AND NEEDS TEXTURE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO USE MY FINGERS CAN T GRAB IT WITHOUT SLIPPING OFF OF THE KNOB 
THE ON/OFF/VOLUME KNOB IS TOO SMALL IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING EVEN WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVIY ALL THE WAY DOWN YOU INEVITABLY CHANGE THE STATION OR SHUT THE RADIO OFF WHILE TRYING TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT BOTH CONTROLS SH 
THE ONE ASPECT OF MY NEW VEHICLE S AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS THAT COULD BE IMPROVED THE MOST IS THE SOUND QUALITY 
THE ONE IN OUR 2012 LACROSSE WAS BETTER DON T LIKE THE TOUCHSCREEN INSTEAD OF BUTTONS IT ALSO TAKES MORE TIME AND MULTIPLE SEQUENTIAL TOUCHES TO DO WHAT WAS FASTER AND ONE TOUCH OF A BUTTON BEFORE THE TURN BOX FROM THE NAV SYSTEM IS TOO BIG AND 
THE ONE KNOB CONTROL IS CUMBERSOME AND SLOW TO INPUT INFOORMATION WITH THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM HAS NO INPUT FOR JUMP DRIVES IPOD ETC JUST A DVD SLOT
THE ONE THING I THINK CAN T BE CONTROLLED BUT THAT I DON T LIKE IS WHEN I HAVE THE STATION SET TO HD IT FREQUENTLY GOES IN AND OUT OF HD CAUSING THE SONG SKIP YOU CAN TELL I M OLD AND REMEMBER RECORDS 
THE ONE THING THAT BOTHERS ME MOST IS THAT THERE WAS NO CD PLAYER ALSO THE SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM AS GOOD AS THE ONE IN THE 2012 COLORADO IT SEEMS PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING/UNDERSTANDING ME WHEN I USE BLUE TOOTH THE SYSTEM DOESN T SEE 
THE ONE THING THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE WONDERFUL WAS THE AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS IT GETS SO ANNOYING SOMETIMES NOT SURE IF THERE IS A WAY TO SHUT IT OFF I LIVE IN CT AND WITH THE SNOW MELTING AND WATER ON THE ROADS I GO THROUGH SO MUCH WI 
THE ONLY AREA WHICH IS IN DEFICIT IS THE HANDLING THERE IS A LACK OF ROAD FEEL WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY THIS WOULD BE THE ONLY AREA WHERE HYUNDAI ENGINEERS SHOULD WORK ON IMPROVEMENT
THE ONLY BLIND SPOT FOR ME IS THE SECOND ROW SEATS HEADRESTS
THE ONLY BLIND SPOTS ARE IN THE BACK CORNERS THEY AREN T TERRIBLE BUT I HAVE TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME CHECKING BEFORE CHANGING LANES 
THE ONLY COMMENT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS REGARDING THE PASSENGER S WINDSHIELD WIPER OPTIMALLY I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO COVER A BIT MORE OF THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD IT SLIGHTLY OBSCURES THE PASSENGER S VIEW HOWEVER FROM THE DRIVER S SIDE THIS 
THE ONLY COMMENT IS THAT THE VISORS WHEN MOVED TO THE SIDE POSITION DO NOT HAVE FRONT TO REAR ADJUSTABILITY THIS COULD BE A RESULT OF THE SMALL SIZE OF THIS CAR VISIBILITY ALL AROUND IS AIDED BY THE LACK OF A REAR QUARTER BLINDSPOT AS A RESULT 
THE ONLY COMPLAINT I WOULD HAVE IS THE BLIND SPOTS BUT YOU HAVE THAT WITH ANY VEHICLE AND I DON T BELIEVE YOU WILL EVER GET RID OF THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM 
THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE LANE DEPARTURE AND FRONT COLLISION WARNING CAN BE A BIT TOO SENSITIVE AT TIMES THERE ARE TIMES THE FRONT COLLISION WENT OFF AND THE ONLY CAR IN FRONT OF ME WAS ON THE NEXT LANE OVER I LANE DEPARTURE WORKS AS IT IS SUPP 
THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE SIZE OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS I FEEL LIKE IT GIVES ME A BIGGER BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY AT A CROSSWALK BUT I FOUND THE SAME THING WHEN DRIVING A PRERUNNER 
THE ONLY COMPLAINT THAT I HAVE IS THAT THE REAR COLUMNS IN THE VEHICLE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE IN THE CAR S BLIND SPOT PERHAPS IF THEY WERE SOMEWHAT THINNER THAT WOULD INCREASE THE VISIBILITY OF THE VEHICLE 
THE ONLY CONCERN IS SITTING AT A STOP SIGN THERE MAY BE SMALL AREA OF A BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO LOOK LEFT AND RIGHT 
THE ONLY CONCERN IS THAT THE HEADLIGHTS FEEL A LITTLE DIM 
THE ONLY CRITICISM I HAVE IS THAT WHEN DRIVING IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL THAT THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON UNLESS YOU LOOK DOWN AT THE INSTRUMENT PANEL SOMETIMES AT DUSK IT CAN BE HARD TO TELL IF THEY ARE ON 
THE ONLY CRITICISM I HAVE REGARDING THE VEHICLE S VISIBILITY IS THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO VIEW THE VEHICLE S BLIND SPOTS PRIOR TO CROSSING LANES 
THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IN VISIBILITY I HAVE EXPERIENCED IS THE LIMITED VIEW WHEN THE CONVERTIBLE TOP HAS BEEN FULLY DECLINED MAKING CARS BEHIND MY SMART VERY DIFFICULT TO VIEW QUICKLY 
THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE IS THAT IT IS A SMALLISH CAR WITH MANY LARGER ONES ON THE ROAD
THE ONLY DOWN SIDE TO THE STEREO IS THAT WHEN YOU STOP AT A STOP SIGN FOR EXAMPLE THE VOLUME GOES DOWN THEN WHEN YOU ACCELERATE IT GOES BACK UP THE VOICE COMMANDS ON THE NAVI ARE MISHEARD ALOT
THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS THAT THE WIFI ENABLED AUTO IS USING T MOBILE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS OLDER THAN WHAT S AVAILABLE FROM T MOBILE OR ANYWHERE ELSE 3G SHOULD BE 4G AND/OR LTE AND EASILY USED REGARDLESS OF CONSUMER SELECTED CARRIER
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE COME ACROSS SO FAR IS WITH THE BLUETOOTH FUNCTION WHILE TRYING TO USE DIFFERENT MEDIA SUCH AS CD AND THEN BEING ABLE TO USE NAVIGATION AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE IT CONNECTED FOR CALLS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR THE NAVIGATION 
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS SOMETIMES WHEN I ON THE BLUETOOTH USING MY PHONE I HAVE TO TURN DOWN THE AUDIO A BIT DUE TO THE CALL SOUNDING MUFFLED CAN BE ANNOYING 
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THAT THE KEYBOARD FOR THE NAVIGATION IS DISABLED WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION I UNDERSTAND FOR SAFETY REASONS BUT WHEN THERE ARE PASSENGERS IN THE CAR THAT COULD OPERATION SAFELY THERE SHOULD BE AN OVERRIDE OR THE SY 
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THAT THE RECIPIENT OF MY PHONE CALL SOMETIMES HAS DIFFICULTY HEARING ME WHEN I USE BLUETOOTH 
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THAT THE SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS FREQUENTLY CHANGE SETTING I NEED TO KNOW PRECISELY WHAT AREA A GIVEN MIRROR IS COVERING TO DO OTHERWISE IS TO INVITE AN ACCIDENT 
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THE DRIVER SIDE FRAME OF CAR THAT CONNECTS TO WINDSHIELD IT S RATHER WIDE AND MAKES AN INCONVENIENT BLIND SPOT
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THE TRAFFIC FUNCTION TAKES ABOUT 30MINUTES TO UPLOAD BY THE TIME IT S READY I M ALREADY AT WORK 
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE NOTICED IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE REAR WINDOW TINTING IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE AN APPROACHING VEHICLE IN THE BLIND SPOT 
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE WHEN CONNECTING MY IPHONE WITH USB AND MY INTERNET CONNECTION NOT CONNECTING WELL WHILE USING IPHONE APPS SUCH AS SPOTIFY OR I HEART RADIO IT ONLY WORKS WELL ON BLUE TOOTH 
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE WITH IT IS I AM FROM THE HORSE & BUGGY DAYS & THE TECHNOLOGY IS A LOT TO GET USED TO BUT I AM GETTING THERE I AM RETIRED AND ONLY DRIVE ABOUT 7500 MILES PER YEAR NOW I READ THE MANUAL BUT JUST NEED TO SIT IN THE DRIV 
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE WITH MY NEW MALIBU IS THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT WHEN LOOKING TO THE LEFT ESPECIALLY WHEN STOPPED AT AN INTERSECTION AND YOU NEED TO SEE IF ANYTHING IS COMING BEFORE YOU START OUT I KEEP THE SEAT BACK A 
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE WITH MY TRUCK HAVING THE TOWING MIRRORS IS THE LACK OF VISIBILITY WHEN PULLING OUT MY WIFE BEING 5 5 SHE HAS TO HAVE THE SEAT RAISED HIGH TO AVOID THAT ISSUE 
THE ONLY ISSUE I WOULD POINT OUT IS THE BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING OUT THE BACK WINDOW FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT THE REAR PILLARS BLOCK A GOOD PORTION MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT WHEN BACKING UP AND SWITCHING LANES 
THE ONLY KNOCK ON THE SAFETY IS THAT THE CAR IS SMALL BUT I KNEW THAT GOING IN IT FEELS VERY SAFE BUT IN A COLLISION WITH A MUCH BIGGER VEHICLE I M GOING TO LOSE THE ONLY KNOCK ON THE VISIBILITY IS THAT I HAVE REMOVED THE READ HEADRESTS TO 
THE ONLY NEGATIVE ASPECT I HAVE EXPERIENCED IS THE FACT THAT THE BOOK MANUAL HAS SOME INFORMATION ONE MUST GO SIT IN THE CAR TURN ON THE IGNITION PULL UP THE DIGITAL MANUAL SEARCH FOR THE SUBJECT MATTER AND THEN READ THE OPERATORS MANUAL SOME 
THE ONLY NEGATIVE TO THIS CAR IS A VISIBILITY ISSUE WHEN BACKING OUT IT IS A CONVERTIBLE AND HAS A BLIND SPOT DO TO THE CONVERTIBLE TOP MY HARD TOP CARRERA 4 DOES NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE PORSCHE HAS GIVEN ME ALL OF THE TOOLS TO CIRCUMVENT THIS I 
THE ONLY NOTE IS THAT THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS CAN BLOCK YOUR VIEW OF SIDE TRAFFIC AT INTERSECTIONS IF THE TOP OF THE MIRROR WAS 2 LOWER WOULD HELP OUT FROM WHERE I HAVE THE SEAT ADJUSTED 
THE ONLY OCCASIONAL DIFFICULTY IS LOOKING OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER FROM THE DRIVER SEAT VISIBILITY ISN T QUITE AS GOOD AS IT IS LOOKING BACK OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER DUE TO THE HEADREST BUT THE SIDE MIRRORS ESP THE BLIND SPOT WARNING ARE SUPERB AN 
THE ONLY ODDITY IS THAT I CANNOT PLAY A YOUTUBE VIDEO AUDIO THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY EVERY TIME I START A YOUTUBE OR EXTERNAL SOURCE VIDEO OUTSIDE OF PANDORA OR ITUNES IT CLICKS BACK OVER TO PANDORA OR ITUNES IT S VERY ODD THAT 
THE ONLY OTHER VEHICLE I VE DRIVEN THAT IS AS DRIVER FRIENDLY INCREDIBLE VISIBILITY WITH NO OBSTRUCTIONS SOLID SAFE AND SECURE ETC IS MY WIFE AND MY 2014 IMPREZA 
THE ONLY OVERALL PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE JEEP IS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IT DOESN T MATTER HOW I ADJUST THE SEAT I SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BEING A BLIND SPOT 
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THAT MY PHONE WOULD NOT CONNECT FOR TEXT MESSAGING I CALLED FOR HELP BUT I DON T THINK MY PHONE IS CAPABLE THE PHONE CALLS WORK GREAT 
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS THE HEAD RESTS ON THE BACK SEAT IF THEY ARE DOWN THEY ARE OK 
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE USING MY IPOD IS THAT I HAVE TO ALSO PLUG IT INTO A POWER SUPPLY AT THE SAME TIME IT IS PLUGGED INTO THE AUX JACK OTHERWISE WHEN THE SCREEN GOES BLANK AFTER SEVERAL SECONDS THE MUSIC/BOOK CUTS OFF WHEN IT IS PLUGGED I 
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH MY 2015 NISSAN IS THE ENTERTAINMENT CD PLAYERS ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD REST I HAD A 2014 NISSAN AND THE CD PLAYERS HAD THE DISC INSERTED INTO THE PLAYERS ITSELF AND NOT IN THE FRONT RADIO LIKE THE 2015 MY KIDS ARE 
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS CAR IS THAT YOU CAN T SEE OUT OF THE RIGHT REAR WINDOW WHEN BACKING UP UNLESS THE PASSENTER SEAT IS MOVED UPWARD I DO USE THE CAMERA BUT I ALSO LIKE TO LOOK 
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE INCOMING PHONE CALL VOLUME IS WAY TOO LOUD DON T KNOW HOW TO LOWER IT IT IS SO LOUD IT COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT 
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE TIRE COVERS HALF THE BACK WINDOW
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS WHEN THE PASSENGER SIDE SUN VISOR IS DOWN ITS HARD TO SEE WHEN MAKING A RIGHT HAND TURN 
THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I HAVE AND IT IS A MINOR ONE IS THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT 
THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS THAT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM GIVES FREEWAY EXITS AS NUMBERS INSTEAD OF STREET NAMES WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE IN ADVANCE 
THE ONLY REAL ISSUES WITH VISIBILITY IS THAT THE VISORS ARE SMALL WITH NO SLIDING FEATURE SO THEY DON T BLOCK AS MUCH AS OTHERS AND THE FRONT END HAS ONE OF THOSE DROP OFF HOODS THAT MAKE TELLING HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO SOMETHING IN FRONT OF YOU A 
THE ONLY REAL VISIBILITY ISSUE IS DUE TO THE SHAPE OF THE C PILLARS WHEN YOU ARE IN A PARKING LOT AND TRYING TO SEE IF ANYONE IS COMING BEHIND THE VEHICLES PARKED ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU THE FAT C PILLARS BLOCK VISIBILITY OF A LARGE AREA THAT SEEM 
THE ONLY REASON I GAVE 5 FOR FEELING OF SAFETY WHEN DRIVING IS THE BLIND SPOT 
THE ONLY REASON I HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THE VISORS IS BECAUSE I M FAIRLY SHORT 
THE ONLY REASON I RATED 9 IS BECAUSE I DID NOT GET THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE WITH MY CAR IT WOULD BE A 10 IF I HAD THE TECK PACKAGE MAYBE ACURA SHOULD CONSIDER SETTING UP THEIR AUDIO SYSTEM WITH A BETTER BRAND ON THEIR STANDARD MODELS THEN THAT WO 
THE ONLY REASON THE FORWARD VISIBILITY GETS AN 8 IS I AM TALL AND SOMETIMES THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS IN A BAD SPOT FOR SEEING CROSSING TRAFFIC SO I NEED TO DUCK TO SEE 
THE ONLY REASON WHY IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE BACK IS BECAUSE I M SHORT
THE ONLY SERIOUS COMPLAINT IS VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT AT 45 DEGREE ANGLES LEFT AND RIGHT THE LARGE WINDSHIELD FRAME SUPPORTS BLOCK VISIBILITY FROM THOSE ANGLES I HAVE ALMOST PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE THE VIEW OF CROSS 
THE ONLY THING ABOUT THE NAVIGATION THAT I DON T LIKE IS THAT IT WON T LET YOU GET DIRECTIONS WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING IT MAKES YOU STOP THE CAR I UNDERSTAND THIS FEATURE BUT IT IS MOST INCONVIENT WHEN THE PASSENGER IS TRYING TO PUT IN THE DIRECTI 
THE ONLY THING FOR VISIBILITY THAT COULD BE CHANGED IS TO HAVE BIGGER SIDE MIRRORS 
THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF IS THE BLUE TOOTH CALLS ARE NOT ALWAYS CLEAR I HAVEN T TRIED TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET SO I COULDNT REALLY RATE IT BUT ONCE I DO IM SURE IT WILL BE SOMETHING I WILL USE OFTEN 
THE ONLY THING I DISLIKE WOULD BE THE SMALL BLIND SPOT MIRROR THAT I SPOKE ABOUT IN THE LAST PAGE I DO FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THAT MIRROR DOES HELP AT LOT IN THE BLIND SPOTS FROM OTHER LANES 
THE ONLY THING I DO NOT LIKE IS THAT THERE ARE NO SIDE AIRBAGS IF A COLLISION WAS TO HAPPEN FROM THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTING YOU FROM THE IMPACT AND THE METAL DOOR 
THE ONLY THING I DON T LIKE IS THE OUTSIDE VIEW MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE HAS A REFLECTION OF THE AIR CONDITION VENT THAT BLOCKS THE VIEW OF ON COMING TRAFFIC OTHER THEN THAT I LOVE MY SRX
THE ONLY THING I FEAR IS THAT I M TOO SMALL FOR OTHER CARS TO SEE IF I M IN A BLIND SPOT 
THE ONLY THING I HAVE A BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH IS WHEN I LOOK BACK TO MY RIGHT TO SEE ONCOMING TRAFFIC BEFORE I MERGE THE SIDE FRAME OF THE CAR GETS IN THE WAY AND I CAN T SEE BUT I LOVE MY CAR!!!
THE ONLY THING I HAVE A PROBLEM IS THE SIDE MIRROR HENDERS MY ABILITY WHEN MAKING LEFT TURNS 
THE ONLY THING I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES THE BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES ARE VERY DANGEROUS COULDN T SEE THE OTHER CARS IN THE OTHER LANE WHEN I WANTED TO MOVE OVER BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOOD!
THE ONLY THING I REALLY DON T LIKE ABOUT MY CAR IS THE POOR VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THE PIECE ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK REALLY HAMPERS THE VISIBILITY I USE MY SIDE MIRRORS A LOT TO COMPENSATE 
THE ONLY THING I THINK COULD REALLY BE IMPROVED IS THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TOUCH SCREEN I ACTUALLY HAVE TO PUSH THE TOUCH SCREEN TO GET IT TO RECOGNIZE MY COMMANDS ON A TABLET FOR EXAMPLE ALL I MUST DO IS LIGHTLY TOUCH IT 
THE ONLY THING I TRULY DISLIKE ABOUT MY CAR THE SUN VISORS ARE TERRIBLE UNLESS THE SUN IS IN A CERTAIN POSITION THEY DON T WORK AT ALL THEY DON T SLIDE OUT OR HAVE A PIECE THAT SLIDES OUT TO EXTEND THE RANGE & THEY ARE TOO SHORT 
THE ONLY THING I TRULY DISLIKE AND ACTUALLY FIND DANGEROUS ARE THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS I FIND THAT THEY CREATE A BLINDSPOT WHEN LOOKING AHEAD TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT I VE ALMOST CRASHED ON A FEW OCCASIONS TO TRY TO AVOID ANY ISSUES I LIFTED T 
THE ONLY THING I VE NOTICED IS A SLIGHT PROBLEM FOR ME IS SEEING THINGS TO THE SIDE/FRONT ON DRIVERS SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE WITH THE POST BETWEEN WINDSHIELD AND DOOR BEING WIDER THAN I M USED TO 
THE ONLY THING I WISH IS THAT ALL VEHICLES COME STANDARD WITH BLUE TOOTH I COULDN T GET IT UNLESS I WANTED THE WHOLE PACKAGE 
THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY IS THE BLIND SPOT FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BUT I AM 6 2 TALL SO I HAVE TO BEND DOWN TO SEE TRAFFIC AT A 4 WAY STOP 
THE ONLY THING IS SIDE VISIBILITY OR CHANGING LANES 
THE ONLY THING IS THAT I AM A BIT SHORT AND I CAN T VIEW ALL OF THE GUAGES THE WAY I WOULD WANT TO I HAVE ADJUSTED THE STEERING WHEEL BUT IT DIDN T WORK THE WAY I WOULD HAVE LIKED I GOT USED TO IT 
THE ONLY THING IS THAT I CAN NOT SEA THE TURNING SIGNAL ON MY DASHBOARD THE STEERING WILL IS BLOCKING MY TURNING SIGNAL VIEW SHOULD BE INSTALL LOWER ON THE DASHBOARD THANK YOU 
THE ONLY THING PREVENTING A 10 IN THE FORWARD VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT IS THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE PLACED AND SIZED SUCH THAT THEY BLOCK A LOT OF VISIBILITY TO THE DRIVERS SIDE 
THE ONLY THING THAT BOTHERS ME IN A WINDY DAY THE VEHICLE FEELS LIGHT AND IS SHAKY
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD BE BETTER IS THE REAR VISIBILITY BUT IF YOU HAVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA LIKE I DO IT WOULDN T BE A PROBLEM 
THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN SAY IS THE VOLUME COULD BE HIGHER 
THE ONLY THING THAT I DO NOT LIKE IN REGARDS TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS THE FACT THAT THE NAVIGATION CANNOT BE ROUTED/RE ROUTED WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION THIS MEANS THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A PASSANGER WHO IS INPUTTING THE ROUTE TO THE NAVI 
THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD CHANGE WOULD BE TO LOWER THE SIDE OF THE DOOR AND MAKE THE SIDE WINDOW LARGER SO THAT YOUR ARM REST IS AT A MORE COMFORTABLE HEIGHT I HAVE MY SEAT ADJUSTED TO THE HIGHEST SETTING SO THAT I CAN SEE OVER THE DASH AND D 
THE ONLY THING THE LEXUS IS MISSING IS A GREAT SOUND SYSTEM SUCH AS BOSE OR HARMAN KARDON
THE ONLY THING WOULD BE THEY TOOK OUT THE MUTE BUTTON THEY SHOULD PUT IT BACK 
THE ONLY TWO ISSUES I HAVE IS WHEN I GO TO USE THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND IT GOES TO CONNECT WITH THE CALLER IT WILL HAVE A ONE TO THREE SECOND BLAST OF MUSIC AND THEN IT WILL CONNECT WITH THE CALLER ALSO I CAN NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO 
THE ONLY VISIBILITY CONCERN IS LOOKING BACK OUT OF REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THE ONLY VISIBILITY ISSUE I HAVE IS SEEING THE DISTANCE IN FRONT AND BEHIND ME WHILE PARKING
THE ONLY VISIBILITY ISSUE IS THE PLACEMENT OF THE HEADREST AND ITS INTERFERENCE WITH REAR VIEW VISIBILITY 
THE ONLY WAY TO SHUT OFF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS TO TURN THE VOLUME TO 0 IF THE SOUND IS MUTED IT UN MUTES ITSELF WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STARTED TURNING THE VOLUME TO 0 ALSO AFFECTS NAVIGATION AND THE BUILT IN PHONE SO I AM CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING THE VO 
THE ONSTAR MODULE FAILURE IS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS!
THE ONSTAR RECEPTION IS UNACCEPTABLE COMPARED TO THE SYSTEM IN MY 2008 GMC I HAVE MADE INQUIRIES TO RESOLVE AND NO ANSWERS YET THE ATT CONNECTION IS NOT GOOD 
THE OPERATIONS USING STEERING CONTROLS AT TIMES IS CONFUSING WE NEED BETTER POSITIONING OF CONTROLS 
THE OPERATORS INSTRUCTION BOOK IS ONLY 3/4 OF AN INCH THICK 
THE OPTION OF HAVING BLUE TOOTH HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION CONTROL
THE OPTION OF MUTING YOUR SYSTEM HAS COME IN HANDY ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS 
THE OPTIONAL BOSE SYSTEM IS VERY NICE THE SYSTEMS ARE MUCH EASIER TO USE THAN MY WIFE S BMW 5 SERIES 
THE OPTIONAL HARMON KARDON AUDIO SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING 
THE OPTIONAL SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM WAS WELL WORTH THE MONEY 
THE OPTIONS FOR STEERING WHEEL OR TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS AND A NICE FEATURE IN ADDITION THE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS ARE LARGE AND EASY TO SEE AND USE 
THE OPTIONS OF PROVIDING MUSIC I WISH THERE WAS AN OPTION OF SELECTING OTHER MODES FOR MUSIC SUCH AS GENDER ARTIST ETC 
THE OPTONAL RADIO HAS EXCELLENT SOUND CHARACTERISTICS 
THE ORDER IN WHICH VOICE RECOGNITION TAKES YOU THROUGH NAVIGATION
THE ORDER OF INFO INPUT FOR NAVIGATION WOULD PERFER STREET # STREET NAME CITY STATE IN THAT ORDER THE WAY IT IS SET UP NOW TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO 
THE OTHER APPS WEATHER TRAFFIC ARE NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED SO I DON T REALLY USE THEM THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT SUPER SENSITIVE SO SOMETIMES I VE FAT FINGERED A BUTTON AND ACCIDENTALLY CALLED SOMEONE 
THE OUTLETS TO CONNECT A USB CORD DOES NOT WORK
THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO LARGE AND OBSTRUCT THE VIEW WHEN TURNING EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT 
THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS COULD DISPLAY A WIDER FIELD BEHIND THE VEHICLE 
THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS COULD HAVE A SMALL MIRROR ATTACHED THAT VIEWS THE BLIND SPOT 
THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS DO NOT AFFORD ENOUGH BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY I HAVE TO MOVE MY HEAD TO CHECK MY LEFT REAR CORNER A STICK ON MIRROR HELPS BUT IS NOT THE IDEAL SOLUTION I VE HAD SOME CLOSE CALLS 
THE OUTSIDE REARVIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL WAY TOO SMALL WAY WAY TOO SMALL!!!
THE OUTSIDE SIDE MIRRORS AND CORNER BRACE ON THE FRONT SIDE WINDOWS CONSTITUTE A REAL BLIND SPOT THE IS A CURVE JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM OUR HOUSE AND I JUST CANNOT SEE A CAR COMING AROUND IT FROM THE LEFT ALSO IN A SHOPPING CENTER PARKING L 
THE OUTSIDE TEMP READOUT IS IN A POOR POSITION WHEN THE STEERING WHEEL IS SET IN LOWEST POSITION THE OUTSIDE TEMP READOUT SHOULD BE IN THE CENTER OF THE DASH OR IN THE REAR MIRROR OR SOME SUCH EASY TO SEE PLACE 
THE OUTSTANDING SOUND SYSTEM
THE OUTWARD VISBILITY IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST POINTS OF THE ACCORD 
THE OVER ALL LOOK
THE OVER ALL SOUND QUALITY FOR MUSIC IS GREAT AND THE BLUE TOOTH FOR PHONE CONVERSATIONS IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE OVERALL APPEARANCE AND GRAPHICS HIGH TECH 
THE OVERALL ATTENTION TO DETAIL OF FORD IN DESIGNING AND BUILDING THIS FORD ESCAPE IS REMARKABLE AND I THANK THE DESIGNERS AND MANUFACTURING ENGINEERS FOR THEIR EXCELLENT WORK!
THE OVERALL AUDIO/SOUND IS POOR AND INCONSISTENT 
THE OVERALL INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM IS DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING COULD BE MADE EASIER TO USE AM GRADUALLY GETTING USED TO IT 
THE OVERALL INTEGRATION OF ALL SYSTEMS AND HOW THEY ARE COMMONLY CONTROLLED!
THE OVERALL LOOK AND THE FUNCTIONALITY IS JUST SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED 
THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED AS IT IS VERY BASIC 
THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE SYSTEM
THE OVERALL OPTIONS AVAILABLE REGARDING THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS AND QUALITY OF THE APPLICATIONS IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL CHEVY HAS COME A LONG WAY IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION WHEN DESIGNING THIS ASPECT OF ITS VEHICLES 
THE OVERALL POWER OR VOLUME OF THE STEREO COULD BE LOUDER 
THE OVERALL SOUND AND VARIETY OF OPTIONS 
THE OVERALL SOUND QUALITY AND THE EASE OF USING MULTIPLE SOURCES IE IPOD TO IPHONE 
THE OVERALL SOUND QUALITY OF THE SPEAKER SYSTEM COULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED MY 2012 MAZDA 3 WITH A BASE SOUND SYSTEM SOUNDS BETTER THAN THE PREMIUM SYSTEM THAT COMES WITH THE 2015 MUSTANG GT PREMIUM 
THE OVERALL SOUND QUALITY OF THE SYSTEM IS AVERAGE AT TIME THE VOICE ACTIVATED FEATURES CAN BE FRUSTRATING NAVIGATING FROM PHONE RADIO MEDIA ECT CAN BE CHALLENGING WHILE DRIVING 
THE OVERALL SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME I HAVE NOTHING BAD TO SAY AT ALL ABOUT THE 2015 LINCOLN MKZ
THE OVERALL SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND WORKS WELL 
THE OVERALL SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW TO START UP TURNING OFF THE CLIMATE CONTROL SHOULD BE A BUTTON NOT BURIED IN THE MENUS LIKEWISE TURNING THE SEAT HEATER ON IS BURIED IN THE CONTROLS IT IS THE FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IN THE WINTER AND THE SYS 
THE OVERALL VOLUME OF PHONE CALLS OVER BLUETOOTH COULD BE INCREASED 
THE OWNER S MANUAL IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND SO I FEEL AS THOUGH I AM NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALL THAT THE VEHICLE SYSTEMS HAVE TO OFFER 
THE OWNERS MANUAL SUPPLEMENT STATES THAT VOICE COMMANDS CAN BE USED WITH THE AUDIO SYSTEM TO CHANGE A SOURCE STATION ETC HOWEVER CHEVROLET ADVISES THAT THE TRAX DOES NOT INCLUDE VOICE COMMANDS FOR AUDIO FOR THE PHONE ONLY I BELIEVE THE T 
THE PAIRED APPLICATION THAT RUNS OF THE IPHONE NEVER SEEMS TO WORK I THINK IT S CALLED ENTUNE ALSO I HATE THAT I CANNOT MANUALLY ENTER AN ADDRESS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING 
THE PAIRING OF DEVICES IS THE SIMPLEST INTERFACE
THE PAIRING WITH DEVICE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED 
THE PAIRING WITH MY PHONE ALTHOUGH IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO GET THE CORRECT NUMBER WHEN I AM GIVING VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS THE HANDS FREE ABILITY TO TALK WITHOUT HOLDING A PHONE TO MY EAR IS OUTSTANDING AND I AM QUITE SPOILED! HOWEVER I WOU 
THE PANDORA APP THAT IT COMES WITH NEEDS WORK IT HAS MAJOR CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WITH MY HTC ONE WHEN IT DOES WORK I LOVE IT BUT THIS IS ONLY ABOUT 60% OF THE TIME I USE PANDORA A LOT SO ITS QUITE IRRITATING ESPECIALLY SINCE ITS ONE OF THE 
THE PANDORA COMES ON EVERY TIME I ENRER MY VEHICLE I DON T HAVE TO RE SET IT UP EVERY TIME 
THE PANDORA RADIO OPTION DOESN T WORK WELL ALSO WHEN I TRY TO PLAY MUSIC FROM MY PHONE IT TRY S TO PLAY THROUGH PANDORA AND DOESN T ALWAYS WORK PROPERLY 
THE PANEL BETWEEN THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW AND THE WINDSHIELD MAKE IT HARD TO SEE AROUND TIGHT TURNS AND CORNERS SOMETIMES ESPECIALLY AS COMPARED TO AN SUV 
THE PANEL ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WHEN LOOKING TO CHANGE LANES IS IN THE WAY 
THE PANELS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MIRRORS CAN OBSTRUCT VIEW OF TRAFFIC
THE PANORAMIC SLICE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR IS DISCONCERTING TO ME WHEN I LOOK INTO IT PRIOR TO CHANGING LANES 
THE PANORAMIC SUNROOF WHETHER REAL OR PERCEIVED SEEMS TO OPEN UP THE VIEW OF SURROUNDING TRAFFIC 
THE PARKING ASSIST SENSORS HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING ON PREVENTING DINGS AND FENDER BENDERS WOULD BE EVEN BETTER IF I HAD THE LANE DEPARTURE AND OTHER FEATURES 
THE PARKING ASSIST SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT AND I AM PARKED BETWEEN TWO LARGE VEHICLES 
THE PARTITION BETWEEN RT FRONT AND BACK DOORS IS A BIT TOO WIDE HARD TO SEE BLIND SPOT 
THE PARTITIONED SIDEVIEW MIRRORS MADE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS COMING UP ESPECIALLY ON THE DRIVER S SIDE 
THE PASSENGER CANNOT OPERATE THE NAV SYSTEM WHEN THE CAR IS MOVING THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY RESTRICTION YOU KNOW WHEN THE PASSENGER AIRBAG IS ACTIVE ALLOW NAV SYSTEM USE 
THE PASSENGER DOOR MIRROR COULD TILT DOWN WHEN REVERSING TO ALLOW FOR GREATER EASE IN SEEING THE CURB FOR PARALLEL PARKING 
THE PASSENGER HEAD REST OBSTRUCTS VISION WHEN LOOKING BEHIND TO MERGE INTO TRAFFIC
THE PASSENGER HEAD REST REALLY GETS IN THE WAY WHEN LOOKING OVER BUT I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR IT MAKES LOOKING OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER A LOT EASIER 
THE PASSENGER HEADREST BLOCKS VISION
THE PASSENGER SEAT HEADREST BLOCKS THE RIGHT SIDE VIEW WHEN MERGING INTO TRAFFIC CO9MING FROM THE RIGHT 
THE PASSENGER SEAT IN FRONT SITS TOO LOW AND MAKES IT HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND THE VISOR TO BLOCK THE SUN DOESN T HELP
THE PASSENGER SEAT IS VERY HIGH AND MAKES IT HARD FOR THE DRIVER TO SEE OUT THE REAR OR SLIGHTLY TO THE REAR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE I LIKE HOW HIGH THE DRIVER SITS IN THE CAR 
THE PASSENGER SEAT S HEADREST BLOCKS MY VIEW WHEN LOOKING BACK TO SEE IF ANYONE IS COMING UP ON MY RIGHT 
THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG WHICH RUNS ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD IS A VIEW OBSTRUCTION IT CREATES A BLINDSPOT WHICH I FIND I HAVE TO DELIBERATELY LEAN FORWARD IN ORDER TO SEE PROPERLY 
THE PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT AND REAR BACKING VISIBILITY WITHOUT THE ELECTRONIC AIDS WHICH DO A GREAT JOB WOULD BE TOUGH THE REAR CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM ARE MUST HAVES 
THE PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT WHILE DRIVING IS DISCONCERTINGLY BIG 
THE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA GETS A LITTLE ANNOYING WHEN IT COMES ON FOR EVERY RIGHT TURN NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE 
THE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA THAT IS INTEGRAL WITH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SHOWS AN EXCELLENT VIEW OF TRAFFIC IN THE RIGHT LANE WHEN THE RIGHT TURN SIGNAL IS ENGAGED 
THE PASSENGER SIDE LANE ASSIST CAMERA THAT GOES ON AUTOMATICALLY WHEN USING THE TURN SIGNAL FOR CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT IS A GREAT FEATURE 
THE PASSENGER SIDE LANE CAN BE TOUGH TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES SMALLER CARS ARE TOUGH TO PICK HUP AT NIGHT 
THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR HAS A CAMERA ON IT THAT INTERACTS WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN TO SHOW MY BLINDSPOT THE VIDEO REALLY DISTRACTS ME AND I FEEL LIKE I CANT TRUST IT I FEEL MORE SAFE LOOKING IN THE ACTUAL MIRROR 
THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR IS LARGE AND SOMETIMES IS HARD TO SEE OVER WHEN LOOKING TO THE RIGHT FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC AT AN INTERSECTION 
THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR IS POSITIONED A LITTLE HIGH ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE MAKING IT HARDER TO SEE TRAFFIC ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN ENTERING TRAFFIC AND PARALLEL PARKING 
THE PASSENGER SIDE VIEW OUT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD IS OBSTRUCTED 
THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER HAS NEVER QUITE CLEARED THE WINDSHIELD COMPLETELTY I THINK THAT THE ANGLE OF THE WIPER IS SLIGHTLY ASKEW 
THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH PRESSURE TO ALWAYS CLEAR THE WINDSHIELD 
THE PASSENGER SIXE SEAT IS MANUAL DONT LIE IT AT ALL
THE PASSENGER WIPER DOESN T CLEAR AS WELL AS IT SHOULD
THE PCM SYSTEM IS AMAZING I LIKE THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE PHYSICAL BUTTONS AND ALSO THE SCREEN DISPLAY AND USER INTERFACE VERY EASY TO USE AND VERY LOGICAL USER INTERFACE 
THE PEARL WHITE COLOR
THE PEOPLE COMPLAIN OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR CLEARLY
THE PEOPLE I CALL CAN BARELY UNDERSTAND ME AND I END UP USING MY EARPHONES I NEVER RECEIVED HELP USING MY VOICE RECOGNITION HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO USE IT
THE PERFORMANCE OF A SPORT SEDAN BUT THE FUNCTION OF A SUV
THE PERSON I AM CALLING HAS A HARD TIME HEARING ME IF I HAVE MY HEATING/COOLING SYSTEM GOING OR IF I AM DRIVING ABOVE 50MPH
THE PERSON YOU TALK TO CAN NOT HEAR ME
THE PHONE
THE PHONE AUDIO SHOULD BE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE CAR I CAN ONLY HEAR IT ON RIGHT FRONT SPEAKER 
THE PHONE BEING ABLE TO BE USED CLEARLY WITHOUT HAVING TO MANUALLY CALL OR ANSWER WE ALSO LIKE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND THE REVERSE BACK UP CAMERA 
THE PHONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTS AUTOMATICALLY AND FLAWLESSLY
THE PHONE BOOK STINKS 
THE PHONE BUTTON IS FAR TOO SENSITIVE AND THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH ACTIVATES AND IT S ANNOYING
THE PHONE CALL QUALITY IS GREAT 
THE PHONE CALLS ARE EXTREMELY PLAIN AND EASY TO HEAR CAN KEEP YOUR ATTENTION ON YOUR DRIVING AND NOT BE DISTRACTED A SAFETY FEATURE IN MY WAY OF THINKING HANDS FREE OPERATION 
THE PHONE COMMUNICATIONS ON MY NEW COUNTRYMAN ARE 100 TIMES BETTER THAN MY MINI COOPER S I M VERY PLEASED WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS 
THE PHONE CONNECTION AND CLARITY IS SOMETHING I RELY ON DAILY IT IS PERFECT
THE PHONE CONNECTION AND EASE OF USE 
THE PHONE CONNECTION AND SOUND IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE PHONE CONNECTION IS A LITTLE BEHIND THE TIMES THE CONTACT LIST IS SLOW TO LOAD AND THE PHONES SPEED DIALS DON T TRANSFER OVER INSTEAD THE USER HAS TO SET SPEED DIALS ON THE CARS SYSTEM I HAVE USED THE KIA OPTIMA SYSTEM AND IT IS FLAWLESS 
THE PHONE CONNECTION IS VERY CLEAR 
THE PHONE CONNECTION NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO EASILY BE TURNED ON AND OFF FROM THE CAR NOT ALL CALLS NEED TO BE BROADCAST THROUGH THE SPEAKERS 
THE PHONE CONNECTIONS ARE CONVENIENT AND EASY TO USE 
THE PHONE CONNECTS AS SOON AS I GET IN THE CAR BY ITSELF
THE PHONE DATA IS LIKE USING MY IPHONE 
THE PHONE DIRECTORY AND VOICE ACTIVATED PHONE NUMBER LOOKUP IS CONFUSING AND SEEMS OVERLY COMPLICATED 
THE PHONE DOESN T ALWAYS CONNECT AUTOMATICALLY IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WOULD DO THAT 
THE PHONE HAS TOO MANY STEPS BEFORE IT MAKES A CALL
THE PHONE IF I RECEIVE A CALL WHILE DRIVING I CAN ANSWER IT WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTED
THE PHONE IS SO CLEAR 
THE PHONE MODULE TAKES UP TOO MUCH ROOM IN THE CENTER CONSOLE STORAGE IT SHOULD BE EASILY REMOVABLE BY THE OWNER 
THE PHONE PAIRING PROCESS IS TOO COMPLEX AND NEEDS TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
THE PHONE PORTION IS NOT USABLE TO ME I HAVE AN ANDROID MOTOX I VE CONNECTED IT VIA BLUETOOTH AND TESTED CALLS THE OTHER PERSON SAYS IT IS NOT CLEAR WHICH WAS MY EXPERIENCE AS THE DRIVER TOO CONTROLS ARE NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND WO 
THE PHONE RECEIVER CAN NOT UNDERSTAND MY VOICE I CANT USE CAR PHONE I CANT USE MY PHONE CELL EITHER ALWAYS HANGS UP IF I TURN PHONE OFF TO RELY TO COMMANDS OF CAR
THE PHONE RECEPTION AND VOICE QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE 2013 FORD F150 THAT I REPLACED THE RADIO STATION PRESETS HAVE TOO MUCH DELAY WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN STATIONS 
THE PHONE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE LOADED EVERY TIME YOU START THE CAR THE NAV TELLS YOU EVERY TIME TO DO THE FOLLOWING LIST NUMBER STREET CITY AND STATE 
THE PHONE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT PERFECT BUT VERY GOOD I LIKE USING THE HANDS FREE AND LIKE HOW EASILY IT AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTS FOR ME 
THE PHONE SYSTEM 
THE PHONE SYSTEM HAS TOO MANY STEPS CAN NOT SEEM TO SAY JUST CALL AND GIVE NUMBER AND IT WILL NOT GO TO RIGHT NAME IN MY CONTCT
THE PHONE SYSTEM IS AWSOME 
THE PHONE SYSTEM IS HARD TO NEGOTIATE WHILE DRIVING 
THE PHONE SYSTEM IS NEVER CONSISTANT AS FAR AS SHOWING MY PHONEBOOK ON THE DISPLAY IS ONLY COMES UP ABOUT 10% OF THE TIME 
THE PHONE SYSTEM IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY 09 RAM IN REGARDS TO MAKING MORE THAN ONE CALL ONE AFTER THE OTHER WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO HANG UP AND IMMEDIATELY MAKE ANOTHER CALL AS THOUGH TIME NEEDS TO PROCESS BETWEEN PHONE AND RADIO
THE PHONE SYSTEM IS UNACCEPTABLE THE PEOPLE ON OTHER END OF PHONE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE SPEAKER IN THE CAR 
THE PHONE SYSTEM SOUND IS TERRIBLE 
THE PHONE SYSTEM TELLING IT WHO TO CALL AND BEING ABLE TO USE IT WITHOUT DISTRACTION
THE PHONE WOULD STAY CONNECTED ONCE PAIRED 
THE PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE NAVIGATION MAP IS EXCEPTIONAL OTHER THAN THAT IT SUCKS THE STREET NAMES ARE FIXED SO YOU DON T HAVE STREET NAMES DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN UNLESS YOU CHANGE THE MAGNIFICATION BUT WITH THAT SAID MOST OF THE STR 
THE PICTURE ON THE SCREENS ARE NOT THE SAME QUALITY 
THE PILLAR BETWEEN THE DOORS BLOCKS THE VIEW IN SOME MERGE SITUATIONS
THE PILLAR BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOORS IS VERY WIDE WHICH MAKES SIDE VISIBILITY DIFFICULT AT TIMES 
THE PILLAR BETWEEN THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR AND HATCH IS QUITE A BLIND SPOT!
THE PILLAR ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF WINDSHIELD WHEN LOOKING RIGHT 
THE PILLARS ARE REALLY BIG AND BULKY AND THE REAR WINDOW IS SO HIGH THAT IT REALLY LIMITS THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW I WOULD SUGGEST ADDING A BUTTON TO THE CAR TO VIEW VIA THE REAR CAMERA WHILE IN DRIVE TO GET A BETTER VIEW 
THE PILLARS PARTICULARLY THE B PILLARS ARE HUGE AND WITHOUT THE ELECTRONIC ASSIST WOULD MAKE THE CAR NEARLY UNDRIVABLE DUE TO A LACK OF REAR VISIBILITY 
THE PILLER FOR THE WINDSHIELD IS TOO WIDE CAUSES A BLIND SPOT 
THE PIONEER 9 SPEAKER SYSTEM AND THE HANDS FREE VOICE RECONIGITION
THE PLACE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION LOWER IN THE CAR THAN THE CEILING LIGHT 
THE PLACE WHERE THE SIDE MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE IS LOCATED MAKES IT HARD FOR A SHORTER PERSON TO SEE TRAFFIC COMING FROM THE RIGHT WE LIVE IN AN AREA WITH A LOT OF HILLS AND THE MIRROR HAS BLOCKED ME FROM SEEING A CAR CRESTING A HILL TO MY 
THE PLACEMENT OF THE LIGHT SWITCH CAN BE EASILY TAPPED AND CHANGING THE SETTING WITHOUT KNOWING THE CHANGE 
THE PLACEMENT OF THE SPEAKER MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I NEED TO INCREASE MY VOICE VOLUME WHEN TALKING ON THE PHONE SO I COME ACROSS SHOUTING AT TIMES I LOVE MUSIC SO THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENT FOR SOUND QUALITY LIKE BOSE SP 
THE PLACEMENT OF THE VISORS ALONG WITH A LACK OF ABILITY TO ADJUST SEAT HEIGHT GIVE LIMITED FRONT WINDSHIELD VISIBILITY & FEELING OF CRAMPED SPACE & LESS SAFETY VISOR IS HORRIBLE NOT LONG ENOUGH USELESS ON THE SIDE WINDOW 
THE PLAYING MODE DISPLAY FOR MUSIC ON A FLASH DRIVE SHOULD SHOW THE FILENAME NOT JUST THE METADATA OF THE FILE 
THE PLUG INS ARE IN THE CONSOLE WITH SMALL HOLES IN SIDES FOR CORDS TO RUN THROUGH 
THE POI DATABASE SHOULD BE MORE EXTENSIVE SO FAR EXCEPT FOR HONDA DEALERS I HAVE NOT HAD A MATCH FOR ANY PHONE NUMBERS 
THE POINTS OF INTEREST FUNCTION ON NAVIGATION IS CUMBERSOME 
THE POOR DESIGN OF THE LANE CHANGE WARNING IT A MAJOR ISSUE BECAUSE I HAVE OTHER CARS WITH MUCH BETTER/MORE RELIABLE SYSTEMS THUS I HAVE TO CATCH MYSELF FROM RELYING ON THE BMW SYSTEM WHICH IS SPOTTY AT BEST 
THE PORT FOR AUX AND LOCATIONS OF ALL PLUGIN COMPONENTS
THE POSITION AND SIZE OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR OCCASIONALLY BLOCKS VIEW OF THING LOW AND IN FRONT OF YOU 
THE POSITION OF DRIVERS SEAT IS SO FAR BACK THAT THE B PILLAR IS AN OBSTRUCTION 
THE POSITION OF THE A POSTS MAKE SOME VISIBILITY DIFFICULT FROM THE DRIVER S POSITION 
THE POSITION OF THE DOOR POST OFTEN OBSTRUCTS VISIBILITY OUT THE DRIVER S SIDE AS WELL AS THE PASSENGER SIDE 
THE POSITION OF THE FRAME CAUSES A BLIND SPOT WHILE TURNING LEFT THE WINDOW AND FRAME ON THE PASSENGER SIDES GIVES A BLIND SPOT IF YOU HAVE A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SET 
THE POSITION OF THE NAV SCREEN IS AWKWARD FOR THE PASSENGER TO TYPE ON AND TOUCH IT IS ANGLED TO THE DRIVER 
THE POSITION OF THE PLUG IN NAVIGATION IS ANNOYING AND MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE/FOCUS SOMETIMES 
THE POSITION OF THE USB PORT IS INCONVENIENT 
THE POSITIONING OF THE B PILLAR SOMETIMES OBSTRUCTS VISION WHEN MAKING A TURN OR CHANGING LANES
THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING AND RECEIVING PHONE CALLS VIA BLUETOOTH WITHOUT LEAVING THE STEERING WHEEL UNATTENDED 
THE POST AT THE FRONT LEFT OF THE WINDSHIELD MAKES IT HARD TO SEE APPROACHING VEHICLES WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN THIS IS ACTUALLY A HAZARD 
THE POST BETWEEN THE FRON WINDOW AND THE FRONT DOOR IS WIDE AND CREATES BLIND SPOTS 
THE POST BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD & DOOR IS WIDE ENOUGH TO BLOCK VIEW OF SOMEONE COMING FROM THE FRONT SIDE ANGLE 
THE POST BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE FRONT DOOR WINDOWS HAS BLOCKED BOTH PEOPLE AND CARS WHILE GETTING READY TO MAKE A TURN 
THE POSTS BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND DOORS ARE TOO WIDE OR IN A POOR LOCATION 
THE POSTS IN THE FRONT CORNERS ARE KIND OF BIG AND CAN CAUSE BLIND SPOTS
THE POWER
THE POWER AND FUN
THE POWER CONTROL NOT IN A GOOD PLACE
THE PREFECT WORKS BLUETOOTH
THE PREMIUM BEATS AUDIO SPEAKERS HAVE POOR SOUND QUALITY I HAD BETTER SOUNDING AUDIO IN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE THAT WAS HALF THE PRICE 
THE PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM IS NOT AVAILABLE UNLESS YOU SPECIFY LEATHER SEATS SINCE I AM A VEGETARIAN I DON T WANT MY CAR TO SMELL OF LEATHER BUT THAT APPARENTLY MEANS I CAN T ENJOY THE BEST QUALITY AUDIO!
THE PRESENTATION OF THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS ON TOUCHSCREEN
THE PRESET BUTTONS ON THE RADIO SHOULD BE BAND/SOURCE RELATED FOR XM RADIO THE STATION NAMES SHOULD BE LARGE IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT STATION YOU ARE LISTENING TO 
THE PRESET RADIO STATIONS NEED TO BE EASIER TO USE I LIKE THE OLD STYLE PERMANENT BUTTONS 1 6 THAT ARE ALWAYS THERE DON T LIKE SEARCHING THE SCREEN FOR THEM AND ONLY 3 SHOW AT A TIME
THE PRESETS ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AS THEY ARE NOT USED AS TRADITIONAL PRESETS BUT RATHER AS MEMORY SETTINGS FOR INSTANCE ONLY ONE OF THE PRESET BUTTONS IS USED TO STORE ALL OF YOUR FAVORITE RADIO STATIONS 
THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED AIR BAG PROBLEM FOR PASSENGER
THE PRICE WAS RIGHT
THE PRIMARY REASON I WENT FOR THE VEHICLE BEING IN THE PRICE RANGE I WAS LOOKING FOR THE RANGE IN VEHICLE AMENITIES LIKE THIS!
THE PROBLEM IS THAT I USE ANDROID GOOGLE PLAY APPS FOR NAVIGATION I WISH YOU COULD GET A CAR THAT USED ANDROID AND GOOGLE PLAY APPS THEN I COULD HAVE EVERYTHING I WANT AS IT IS INAVIGATE MOSTLY WITH MY PHONE THE APP I WANT TO USE IS WAZE 
THE PROBLEM WITH THE CD PLAYER KEEPS ME FORM RATING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM HIGHER I ALSO THINK IT SHOULD HAVE A MULTIPLE CD CHANGER INSTEAD OF A SINGLE DISC 
THE PROCESS OF ENTERING A DESTINATION ADDRESS IS TOO COMPLICATED IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER IF HAD TOUCH SCREEN BUTTONS OR A TRACK PAD TO ENTER THE ADDRESSES 
THE PROGRAMING OF THE SAFETY SYSTEMS COULD BE BETTER OR EASIER
THE PROGRAMMING OF THE PRE SET CHANNELS IS NOT EASY
THE PROJECTOR BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT OVER PREVIOUS GENERATIONS AND DO WELL TO LIGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE FRONT THE VISIBILTY TO THE REAR SIDES IS STILL POOR ALTHOUGH IT HAS ALSO IMPROVED SLIGHTLY OVER PREVIOUS MODELS DRIVER S CO 
THE PUSHBUTTONS THAT REPLACE THE SHIFTING MECHANISM ARE AN IDEA OUT OF STAR TREK I E DATED FUTURISM OF THE 1970S ALSO AWKWARD TO USE THERE S A REASON NO MANUFACTURER HAS STAYED WITH THIS IDEA FOR LONG I VAGUELY REMEMBER THAT SOME COMPAN 
THE Q40 REMOVED THE BACKUP ASSISTANCE WARNING ALERTS WHEN YOU ARE REVERSING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE VEHICLE BEHIND YOU IT DOESN T MAKE SENSE TO REMOVE AN INCREDIBLY USEFUL WARNING ALERT OPTION 
THE Q40 SHOULD SHOULD HAVE A FEW MORE OPTIONS FOR THE PRICE
THE Q40 USES THE SAME TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS USED IN THE G35 AND G37 WHICH IS MORE THAN 6 YEARS OLD 
THE QUALITY AND CLARITY OF SOUND OF THE HANDS FREE PHONE SYSTEM WHETHER IT BE A CELL CALL VIA BLUE TOOTH OR THE CAR S INTERNAL PHONE SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT I ALSO AM A BIG FAN OF THE SAFETY ASPECT IT PRESENTS WHILE DRIVING IT S NO DIFFERENT THAN 
THE QUALITY AND CLEARNESS OF THE SYSTEM EVEN AT HIGH VOLUME LEVELS 
THE QUALITY OF CALLS VOLUME WHEN USING HANDS FREE CONNECTION 
THE QUALITY OF COMMUNICATION VIA BLUETOOTH
THE QUALITY OF MAPS AND VISUAL CUES 
THE QUALITY OF RADIO SOUND IS VERY POOR 
THE QUALITY OF SOUND
THE QUALITY OF SOUND & FUNCTION I E USABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS IT WORKS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL!
THE QUALITY OF SOUND FROM THE SPEAKERS
THE QUALITY OF SOUND FROM THE SPEAKERS SEEMS TO BE AIMED MORE TOWARDS THE VOICE CONTROLS THAN THE MUSIC 
THE QUALITY OF SOUND IS AMAMZING!!
THE QUALITY OF SOUND IS EXCELLENT
THE QUALITY OF SOUND IS GREAT FOR INSIDE THE VEHICLE THIS IS NOTICEABLE ESPECIALLY WHEN ALL WINDOWS ARE ROLLED UP AND THE VEHICLE IS QUIET INSIDE 
THE QUALITY OF SOUND IS GREAT! I DON T USE THE HANDS FREE MODE ON MY PHONE BECAUSE I ALWAYS HAVE SOMEONE WITH ME I LIKE TO KEEP MY CALLS PRIVATE 
THE QUALITY OF SOUND IS OK BUT MORE BASS WOULD BE BETTER
THE QUALITY OF SPEAKERS 
THE QUALITY OF THE AUDIO
THE QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD FOR A FACTORY INSTALLED SYSTEM I PICKED UP THE PREMIUM AUDIO SYSTEM AND HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS THOUGH I FOUND THE BUILT IN SOUND PROFILES REALLY SUCKED AND WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE STEREO SYSTE 
THE QUALITY OF THE BASE SYSTEM NOT NAME BRAND SYSTEM SPEAKERS ETC COULD BE IMPROVED 
THE QUALITY OF THE FRONT WIPERS IS ATROCIOUS HARD TO UNDERSTAND FOR A VEHICLE THAT COSTS $30K
THE QUALITY OF THE HANDSFREE CALLING LOWERS THE OVERALL RATING CALLED PARTIES COMPLAIN ABOUT THE NOISE LEVEL THERE ARE HIGH QUALITY NOISE CANCELLING HANDS FREE BLUE TOOTH TECHNOLOGIES WHICH COULD BE INSTALLED 
THE QUALITY OF THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS ONE I VE EXPERIENCED IN THE 2104 MALIBU LZ THE DIFFERENCE IS CLARITY AND CRISPNESS FRANKLY I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT THE SAME 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND COULD BE IMPROVED 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND FROM MUSIC AS WELL AS PHONE CALLS IS EXCELLENT
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IS NOT WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM A HIGH END VEHICLE 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IS TERRIFIC! I M A MUSICIAN/SINGER AND LOVE THAT I CAN ACTUALLY ENJOY THIS SYSTEM WITHOUT HAVING TO REPLACE IT WITH AN AFTERMARKET PRODUCT 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IS TRULY AMAZING I FEEL AS IF I AM AT A CONCERT AND SITTING ON THE FRONT ROW I AM ABLE TO HEAR EACH INSTRUMENT CLEARLY AND THE VOICE ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CLEAR AS A BELL 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IS VERY GOOD 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND IT HAS AN EXCEPTIONAL FREQUENCY RESPONSE 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND MIGHT BE BETTER IT S A LOWER RANGE TRIM SO A VERY GOOD QUALITY IS ABOUT AS MUCH AS I FIND REASONABLE TO EXPECT AND I PREFER NOT TO HAVE THE DISTRACTION OF A PHONE/TEXT MESSAGES/GPS VOICES WHILE DRIVING SO I M QUITE H 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM AND CLARITY OF CALLS THROUGH THE BLUE TOOTH DEVICE 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND THAT COMES FROM THE SPEAKERS IS REMARKABLE! WE ALSO LOVE THE BLUE TOOTH HANDS FREE TO USE OUR PHONES 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND THROUGH THE MANY SPEAKER SYSTEM
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND WHEN MAKING CALLS USING A BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS POOR PEOPLE RECEIVING CALLS FROM MY VEHICLE SAY IT IS HARD TO HEAR ME 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND WHEN PLAYING MUSIC NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE SPEAKER SOUND
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND WHETHER USING HANDS FREE PHONE OR LISTENING TO MUSIC RADIO OR CD IS OUTSTANDING I APPRECIATE THE TRULY FINE QUALITY OF THE SOUND SPEAKERS ETC THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS WONDERFUL AND THE QUALITY OF PHONE CONVERSATIO 
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUNDS SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT!
THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKER SYSTEM WHILE MAKING CELL PHONE CALLS IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS ARE A JOKE THE VOICE MENU IS A HEADACHE TOO MANY STEPS CANNOT FOCUS ON THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING NAVIGATION COULD BE MORE DETAILED GRAPHICS WISE 
THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS COULD BE A LOT BETTER 
THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS IS NOT GOOD THEY SOUND TINNY THE SUB WOOFER IS UNDER THE DRIVERS SEAT AND CAUSES ANNOYING VIBRATION THE RADIO RECEPTION IS NOT GOOD 
THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS IS VERY NICE 
THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED 
THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS SOUND IS GREAT 
THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS THEY ARE OUTSTANDING 
THE QUALITY OF THE VOICE COMMUNICATION IS EXCEPTIONAL MOST PEOPLE DON T REALIZE I AM CALLING FROM MY CAR 
THE QUALITY OF THE VOICE ON THE PHONE
THE QUALITY OF THE WIPER BLADES AND THE ACCESIBILTY IN RELAXING THEM
THE QUALITY OF VOICE RECOGNITION AND VOICE QUALITY ON THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE FAR SURPASSES ANY SYSTEM I VE HAD IN OTHER VEHICLES TOYOTA SUBARU AND NAVIGATION IS MORE INTUITIVE I VE GOTTEN USED TO THE TOUCH PAD CONTROLLER WORKS WELL EX 
THE QUALITY SEEMS TO BE FINE BUT IT IS VERY BASIC NOTHING SPECIAL COMPARED TO WHAT OTHER CAR MANUFACTURERS OFFER IN THE SAME CLASS AND PRICE RANGE 
THE QUALITY SOUND 
THE QUALITY SOUND AND THE REAR SCREEN SYSTEM
THE QUANTITY OF PROGRAMMABLE AUDIO SELECTIONS THE GRAPHICS OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE OVERALL SOUND IS FINE 
THE QUEST IS VERY SMOOTH AND QUITE WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD FOR A LARGE MINI VAN IT HAS SURPRISINGLY GREAT VISIBILITY THE ADJUSTABLE HEADLIGHTS ARE JUST PLAIN COOL THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS THE GREATEST DRIVING TOOL AND SHOULD BE MANDATORY 
THE QUESTION ABOUT VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES HAS ME THINKING OF THE ENHANCED DRIVER SIDE MIRROR THAT HAS THIS SPLIT FEATURE THAT I GUESS IS SUPPOSED TO HELP WITH CHANGING LANES I DON T THINK IT DOES INITIALLY I FOUND 
THE QUESTION WONT LET ME LIST MORE OF WHAT WE LIKE
THE QUIET OF THE CABIN AND CLEAN AND FULL SOUND OF THE AUDIO SYSTEMS IS WONDERFUL I LIKE ALSO HOW THE VARIOUS VOLUMES AND AUDIO SOURCES COORDINATE APPROPRIATELY WHEN FOR EXAMPLE THE NAV SYSTEM IS GIVING ME AN INSTRUCTION WHILE MY RADIO IS PLAYI 
THE RADAR CRUISE CONTROL IS AN OUTSTANDING SAFETY DEVICE 
THE RADICAL AND AWESOME DESIGN OF THE REAR OF THE V COUPE DOES LEND ITSELF TO GREAT REARWARD VISIBILITY I KNEW THIS GOING IN SO NOT A REAL PROBLEM THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A NICE TOUCH FOR PARKING CAR IS AWESOME!
THE RADIO / NAVIGATION HAS SPLIT SCREEN FOR SHOWING BOTH ITS ARDUOUS TO SET UP AND REMOVE FROM EITHER RADIO NAVIGATION OR SPLIT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TOGGLE BETWEEN THEM RADIO STATIONS ARE HARD TO SET WITHOUT TOGGLING UP / DOWN THE ON SCR 
THE RADIO ACTUALLY HAS TROUBLE WITH MAINTAINING A STEADY WORKING FLOW SOMETIMES IT WILL SKIP SONGS RANDOMLY 
THE RADIO AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WITH MY PHONE MAKE MUSIC PLAYING AND PHONE PLACING/RECEIVING SO SIMPLE I LOVE IT!
THE RADIO AND NAVIGATION VOLUME IS A BIT AWKWARD TO ADJUST SINCE THEY ARE BOTH TOGETHER 
THE RADIO AND SPEAKER SYSTEM ARE AWESOME
THE RADIO AND SPEAKERS ARE CHEAP THE CAR NEEDS BETTER SPEAKERS AND MORE SPEAKERS WITH THE HIGH GAS MILEAGE THAT THIS CAR GETS I WOULD THINK PEOPLE WILL BE COMMUTING LONG DISTANCES TO AND FROM WORK LIKE I DO A GOOD SOUNDING SYSTEM IS NEEDED 
THE RADIO BEEPS WITH YOU CHANGE HEAT ETC 
THE RADIO CAN LOOK AND FEEL A LOT BETTER THAN IT IS
THE RADIO CHANNELS NEED TO BE IN THE VOICE RECOGNITION 
THE RADIO CONTROLS COULD BE EASIER IT IS VERY EASY TO SWITCH BETWEEN PRESETS ON SAT RADIO BECAUSE YOU CAN USE THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ANYTHING BEYOND THAT YOU HAVE TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN WHICH IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT WHILE DRIVING 
THE RADIO CONTROLS ON THE STEREO 
THE RADIO CONTROLS STATION SELECTION BUTTONS SOUND ADJUSTMENTS ARE NOT CONSUMER FRIENDLY 
THE RADIO COULD LOOK BETTER IE WHEN IN FM MODE IT IS NOT VARY ATRACKTIVE 
THE RADIO DIAL IS AN ARMS LENGTH AWAY I CAN CONTROL IT FROM THE STEERING WHEEL BUT I HAVE A LIST OF ALL RADIO STATIONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL THE CONTROL THAT IS FARTHER AWAY HAS MY FAVORITES IT IS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE TO FLIP THROUGH THE ST 
THE RADIO DISPLAY CAN BE VASTLY IMPROVED TO SHOW THE ARTIST AND SONG TITLE ON THE SAME SCREEN THE ICON FOR AM/FM ON THE DISPLAY SCREEN IS WAY TOO BIG 
THE RADIO DISPLAY IS HARD TO SEE EASILY DEFINITELY CANNOT SEE WHILE DRIVING WHICH MAKES IT HARD TO SEE WHO IS CALLING WHEN YOU ARE USING HANDSFREE OR SEE WHAT RADIO STATION 
THE RADIO DISPLAY IS WAY TOO BRIGHT AND THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT 
THE RADIO DISPLAY LOOKS PLAIN COMPARED TO THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY WHICH IS VERY PLEASING 
THE RADIO DOES NOT ALWAYS PAUSE WHEN A PHONE CALL COMES IN 
THE RADIO DOES NOT HAVE A MANUAL ON OFF SWITCH IT COMES ON AS SOON AS YOU START THE VEHICLE SO YOU TAKE A SECOND TO EITHER MUTE IT OR TURN THE SOUND ALL THE WAY DOWN A TIME CONSUMING BAD FEATURE ONLY TO HAVE IT BACK ON AGAIN AFTER VEHICLE IS RE 
THE RADIO DOES NOT HAVE THE NUMBERS TO PUSH THE SCROLLING IS HORRIBLE
THE RADIO DOESN T SOUND AS GOOD AT LOW VOLUME LEVELS IT NEEDS TO BE FAIRLY LOUD IN ORDER TO SOUND ITS BEST 
THE RADIO FADES IN AND OUT AND VOLUME DOES THE SAME 
THE RADIO FEATURES SUCH AS THE EQUALIZER SETTINGS AND ADJUSTMENTS LOVE THE SPLIT SCREEN VIEWINGS
THE RADIO HAS A NUMBER OF BUTTONS AND DIALS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE USES DEPENDING ON THE MODE SELECTED IT S COMPLEX AND NON INTUITIVE IT REQUIRED A LOT OF MANUAL READING TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THE RADIO 
THE RADIO HAS AN ECHO WHICH I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS BECAUSE THE HD RECEPTION 
THE RADIO HAS AN OPTION FOR TEXT MESSAGES BUT IT DOESN T SEEM TO WORK WITH ANY PHONE I HAVE TRIED AND I HAVE A RATHER NEW PHONE WITH THE MOST UP TO DATE SOFTWARE ON IT 
THE RADIO HAS TO BE TURNED WAY UP TO HEAR IT VERY WELL 
THE RADIO IN THE BMW X 4 LOOKS CHEAP
THE RADIO IN THIS VEHICLE IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME I DON T LISTEN OFTEN AND IT GETS THE JOB DONE WHEN I DO I AM SURE HAD I WANTED A BETTER SYSTEM THAT THE BEST IS AVAILABLE 
THE RADIO INTERFACE IS UGLY JUST LOOKS BAD IT S VERY FUNCTIONAL BUT VERY UNAPPEALING 
THE RADIO IS AMAZING 
THE RADIO IS CLEAR 
THE RADIO IS EASY TO USE
THE RADIO IS EXCELLENT 
THE RADIO IS GREAT I LISTEN TO MUSIC OR TALK RADIO WHILE I DRIVE I LOVE THE SET UP WHERE YOU CAN CHOSE YOUR STATIONS FOR QUICK MOVING FROM ONE TO NEXT 
THE RADIO IS NOT EASY TO USE COULD BE MORE EFFICIENT AND INTUITIVE TOO MANY STEPS TO FIND WHAT YOUR ARE LOOKING FOR 
THE RADIO IS OVERLY COMPLICATED TO USE AND SOMETIMES IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HEAR AN ECHO 
THE RADIO IS REALLY NICE AND CLEAR TO LISTEN TO THE FARM REPORTS
THE RADIO IS SO CLEAR!
THE RADIO IS THE MOST DIFFICULT ONE TO USE THAT I HAVE EVER HAD IN A CAR!!!!!
THE RADIO IS THE WEIRDEST THING TO SET UP HAD TO HAVE THE DEALER EXPLAIN IT
THE RADIO IS VERY GOOD BUT WE CONNECT OUR IPHONES TO THE SYSTEM VIA BLUETOOTH AND IT IS A VERY GOOD CONNECTION THE STEREO IS BOSE AND IT IS FANTASTIC THE PHONE CALLS ARE CLEAR AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY HELPFUL WITH TRAFFIC WE HAVE AU 
THE RADIO LOOKS TEN YEARS OLD 
THE RADIO LOOKS TO SIMPLE MITSUBISHI SHOULD MAKE THE RADIO BETTER LOOKING
THE RADIO MY MUSIC SIMPLY DOES NOT GET LOUD ENOUGH 
THE RADIO NEEDS A SEEK BUTTON
THE RADIO OR MUSIC SHOULD COMPLETELY STOP PLAYING WHEN INFORMATION FROM THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS PRESENTED DIRECTION FROM NAVIGATION IS TOO LOW 
THE RADIO PORTION HAS A LOT OF STATIC
THE RADIO PRESET CONTROL COULD BE EASIER TO USE
THE RADIO PRESETS ALSO A MORE INTUITIVE FUNCTION FOR TURNING THE RADIO ON AND OFF WHILE KEEPING THE OTHER DISPLAYS ON THE LITTLE CONSOLE SCREEN I E THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY 
THE RADIO SHOULD BE MUCH BETTER ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING IT IS A VERY COSTLY UPGRADE
THE RADIO SOUND AND QUALITY IS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING CLEAN HIGHS AND MID TONES THE BASS FROM THE SPEAKERS AND THE FACTORY SUB WOOFER AMAZE MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHENEVER TRAVELING 
THE RADIO SOUND AND VOLUME OF MY CURRENT RADIO IS POOR 
THE RADIO SOUND COULD BE BETTER QUALITY 
THE RADIO SOUND IS SPECTACULAR HOW THE HELL DO THEY ACHIEVE THAT WITH SUCH SMALL EQUIPMENT?
THE RADIO SOUND SYSTEM IS 100 TIMES BETTER THAN MY 2013 SILVERADO WHICH HAS A VERY SAD SOUND SYSTEM
THE RADIO SOUNDS GREAT AUDIO & COMMUNICATIONS ARE EXCELLENT REALLY HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET 
THE RADIO SOUNDS GREAT I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THE REST OF IT DON T LIKE SPEAKER PHONES ETC 
THE RADIO STATION DISPLAY SETUP IS POOR COMPARED OTHER CAR MODELS NEEDS BETTER LAYOUT 
THE RADIO STATION SCAN FEATURE DOES NOT EXIST AT LEAST THAT I COULD EASILY FIND AS A RESULT I HAVE TO MANUALLY SEARCH THROUGH STATIONS USING THE STATION DIAL 
THE RADIO STATION SETTINGS ARE SET SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT SOMETIMES WE PRESS THE WRONG ONE & HAVE TO PRESS IT AGAIN TO GET THE CORRECT ONE HARD TO REACH ESP WHILE DRIVING 
THE RADIO STATIONS SHOULD PROGRESS TO THE NEXT GROUP WITHIN THE SOURCE SELECTED IN OTHER WORDS AS THE NEXT STATION BUTTON IS PUSHED THE STATIONS PRESETS SHOULD PROGRESS FROM FM1 TO FM2 AND SO ON NOT JUST REPEAT WITHIN FM1 
THE RADIO SYSTEM IS NICE SO IS THE CD PLAYER I DON T USE ANY THING ELSE 
THE RADIO SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING BUT WITHOUT THE NAVIGATION INSTALLED THE SYSTEM IS WORTHLESS MAKE IT SO WE CAN RUN A GARMIN OR OTHER SOFTWARE THROUGH THE USB PORT OR INSTALL NAVIGATION MAPS ON ALL VEHICLES 
THE RADIO SYSTEM SOUND GREAT 
THE RADIO TOUCHSCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN ON BUMPY ROADS 
THE RADIO TUNING SYSTEM IS VERY POOR DIFFICULT TO SCAN STATIONS ETC 
THE RADIO VOLUME CONTROL IS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE
THE RADIO WORKED WONDERFUL ON A 7 HOUR TRIP I JUST TOOK AND I ALWAYS FOUND A GREAT RADIO STATION ALONG WITH THE CD PLAYER WORKING GREAT
THE RADIO/NAV SYSTEM IS INCONVENIENT TO OPERATE WHILE DRIVING STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS WOULD HELP FOR DRIVING SAFELY
THE RADIO/SATELLITE RADIO AND USC FOR IPOD IS GREAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GET TO KNOW HOW TO USE 
THE RAIN SENSING FUNCTION OF THE FRONT WIPERS EITHER SEEMS TO BE FULL SPEED OR NOT FAST ENOUGH THE INTERMITTENT FUNCTION SEEMS TO NOT WORK AS WELL AS THAT OF OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE OWNED 
THE RAIN SENSING WIPERS DON T WORK ALL THAT GREAT AND THE CONTROL IS CONFUSING SO MAYBE I DON T UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THEM 
THE RAIN SENSING WIPERS KEEP YOUR VISION AT IT S OPTIMUM
THE RAIN SENSING/AUTO ADJUSTING WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE A GREAT AND VERY PRACTICAL OPTION LIVING IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST VISIBILITY IS GOOD FOR A SPORTY SUV AND THE DRIVING POSITION IS COMFORTABLE 
THE RAIN SENSOR EVEN AT THE MOST SENSITIVE SETTING DOESN T ALWAYS WORK 
THE RAIN SENSOR WIND SHIELD WIPERS DON T ALWAYS WORK THE GREATEST I LIKE THE WIND SHIELD TO BE CLEARED AND IT DOESN T ALWAYS SENSE A MIST 
THE RANGE FOR THE BLIND SPOT IS PRETTY BIG YOU REALLY NEED TO LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE RANGE OF SEAT HEIGHTS
THE RANGE OF THE LIGHT FROM THE HEADLIGHTS AT NIGHT IS WIDE AND REALLY NICE TO HAVE
THE RANGE ROVER IS WAY BEHIND THE TECH CURVE WITH ITS INTERFACE WITH MY IPHONE BMW MERCEDES AND ESPECIALLY AUDI DO IT MUCH BETTER THE ON SCREEN INTERFACES ARE TO CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT TO USE A CAR OF THIS PRICE AND CLASS SHOULD REALLY GET 
THE RATING I GAVE ARE FOR THE STOCK RADIO PRIOR TO REPLACING IT WITH AN AFTERMARKET SINCE I COULD NOT USE THE BLUETOOTH AND VOICE SYSTEMS SINCE I DON T HAVE AN APPLE DEVICE I COULDN T PROVIDE MUCH INSIGHT THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO USE 
THE RATING SPEAKS FOR ITSELF 
THE RDX SHOULD COME WITH SIDE CAMERAS WHEN CHANGING LANES JUST LIKE THE 2015 HONDA CRV CONSIDERING THAT ACCURA IS HONDA S LUXURY BRAND THIS IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING THE REAR CAMERA COULD HAVE A BETTER QUALITY AS WELL 
THE REACH FROM THE DRIVER SEAT TO THE AUDIO CONSOLE IS A BIT OF A STRETCH PARTICULARLY PRESET STATIONS 4 6 I M AROUND 6 FT 2 IN AND FEEL MYSELF STRETCHING TO REACH THOSE BUTTONS 
THE READ VISIBILITY IS VERY LIMITED
THE READABILITY OF THE SCREENS AND THE SOUND IS GREAT 
THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC AND ABILITY TO RE ROUTE ME PROACTIVELY 
THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC FEATURE WORKS PRETTY POORLY IN MY OPINION I RARELY GET ALERTS OF ANY TRAFFIC PROBLEMS WHEN ROADS ARE COMPLETELY STOPPED MY OLD GARMIN DID MUCH BETTER 
THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC HAS NEVER BEEN ACCURATE I ALSO OWN A 2015 VEHICLE AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ALREADY OUT OF DATE IT SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY UPLOADED WITH THE MOST CURRENT INFORMATION 
THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC INFORMATION HAS SAVED ME A LOT OF TIME 
THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC INFORMATION IS VERY USEFUL AND ALLOWS ENOUGH TIME TO CHOOSE ALTERNATIVE ROUTES TO THE DESTINATION 
THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC IS PHENOMENAL IT HAS COME IN HANDY MULTIPLE TIMES!
THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC IS VERY CONFUSING AND I DONT THINK THE TRAFFIC IS EVEN FOR MY AREA THAT IT DISPLAYS
THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC SYSTEM IS VERY USEFUL AND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IT S A NECESSITY 
THE REAR ASSIST CAMERA DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK SOMETIMES THE SCREEN IS BLACK THIS BEGAN HAPPENING THE WEEK I TOOK THE VEHICLE HOME
THE REAR B/C?PILLAR IS TOO THICK
THE REAR BACK SEATS WITH HEAD REST BLOCK OUT 20% OF THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME AS I JUST REMOVE THE HEAD REST WHEN NO ONE IS SITTING IN THE REAR SEATS 
THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS A MUST WITHOUT THE CAMERA THERE WOULD BE BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR HOWEVER THE CAMERA HAS AN AMAZING WIDE ANGLE IMAGE DISPLAY SO YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO WHILE BACKING UP 
THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY USEFUL AND THE VIEW IS BROADER AS COMPARED TO MY HUSBANDS PRIUS BACK UP CAMERA 
THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA PICTURE COULD BE IMPROVED 
THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA SYSTEM IS AMAZING
THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA NEEDS TO BE CLEANED OFF OFTEN CAN GET HAZY/BLURRY
THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA SHOULD STAY ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AFTER SHIFTING OUT OF REVERSE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO PARK 
THE REAR BLIND SPOTS OF THE VEHICLE ARE LARGE 
THE REAR CAMERA COULD BE BRIGHTER IN IT S DISPLAY WHEN BACKING UP IT IS POSITIONED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE HATCH AND APPEARS TO BE SHADED BY THE OVERHANG I WILL ASK THE SERVICE WRITER TO HAVE IT INSPECTED ON MY NEXT VISIT 
THE REAR CAMERA DOESNT ALWAYS COME ON
THE REAR CAMERA EXPOSURE AND WARNING BLEEPERS ARE A DEFINITE PLUS WHEN BACKING 
THE REAR CAMERA GREATLY HELPS WHEN BACKING UP WITHOUT IT I WOULD HAVE TROUBLE SEEING DIRECTLY BEHIND ME I M NOT REFERRING TO SIDE/REAR I CAN SEE VERY WELL THERE 
THE REAR CAMERA IS A LITTLE STRANGE LIKE CVR BETTER ALSO THEIRE IS A GLARE FROM DASHBOARD ONTO THE FRONT WINDOW IT TOOK TIME TO NOT NOTICE ON SUNNY DAYS 
THE REAR CAMERA IS A PLUS
THE REAR CAMERA IS A VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE 
THE REAR CAMERA IS A VERY NICE TOOL 
THE REAR CAMERA IS EASILY DIRTIED AND CAN T BE USED FOR BACKING UP THE LARGE POST BEHIND THE REAR DOORS CAUSES BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP AND CHANGING LANES THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND REAR WINDOW ARE LARGE AND EASY TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR AND 
THE REAR CAMERA IS FANTASTIC! WISH I COULD HAVE GOTTEN BLIND SPOT WARNING SIGNALS AND/OR SIDE VIEW CAMERAS IN THIS MODEL 
THE REAR CAMERA IS GREAT AND THE LANE CHANGE SIGNALS ARE VALUABLE FEATURES
THE REAR CAMERA IS OFTEN BLURRY DUE TO CONDENSATION 
THE REAR CAMERA IS ONE OF THE BEST I VE SEEN IN A SUV / CUV MAKES REVERSING AN EASE 
THE REAR CAMERA IS SLUGGISH AT TIMES AND THE INTERFACE TO GO FROM SAT TO AN APP LIKE SPOTIFY STILL NEEDS REFINEMENT
THE REAR CAMERA IS VERY GOOD BUT SOMETIMES YOU DO WANT TO LOOK WITH YOUR EYES AND THAT IS DIFFICULT 
THE REAR CAMERA MAKES IT EASY TO BACKUP 
THE REAR CAMERA MAKES PARKING AND BACKING UP VERY CONVENIENT AND EASY 
THE REAR CAMERA NEEDS SOME FINE TUNING AND THE SUN VISORS SHOULD BE BIGGER AND HOW ABOUT INSTALLING A SMALL FRONT VENT WINDOW?
THE REAR CAMERA SCREEN IS VERY HARD TO SEE DURING THE DAY
THE REAR CAMERA SHOULD HAVE A WIDER FIELD OF VISION 
THE REAR CONVERTIBLE WINDOW IS TOO SMALL WHICH MAKES TERRIBLE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW WHEN THE TOP IS UP 
THE REAR CROSS PATH DETECTION AND HUGE BACKUP CAMERA MAKE UP FOR THE LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY A SPOT MIRROR ADDED TO THE PASSENGER SIDE HELPS WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC WARNING SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD
THE REAR DECK IS HIGH THAT ALLOWS SOME VEHICLES TO FOLLOW YOU CLOSE ENOUGH THAT YOU CAN T SEE THEIR HEADLIGHTS WHICH MAKES THEM HARD TO SEE THE FRONT DOOR PILLAR POST ARE DID AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE A CAR IN THE OPPOSING LANE WHEN MAKING A 
THE REAR DEFROSTER DOES NOT DEFROST THE TOP QUARTER OF THE REAR WINDOW BECAUSE THEY PUT THE ANTENNA THERE I AM TALL SO THAT BASICALLY OBSTRUCTS MY REARVIEW VISION 
THE REAR DRIVER AND PASSENGER WINDOWS ARE SO SMALL THEY ARE BASICALLY USELESS
THE REAR EDGE OF THE HOOD SHOULD NOT BE SOL VISABLE
THE REAR END SIT PRETTY HIGH UP SO I ALWAYS THINK SOMEBODY IS RIGHT ON MY TAIL I HAVE A LID ON THE BED SO THAT BRIGHT WHITE CATCHES MY EYE A LOT IT IS NOT A PROBLEM I AN GETTING USE TO IT THE UPSIDE IS THE BED IS SUPER TALL COMPARED TO ALL THE 
THE REAR END SITS HIGH UP THAT MAKES THE CAR A LITTLE HIGH UP WHEN BACKING UP 
THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM HAS A COMPONENT IN EACH SEAT AND THEY ALL PLAY THE SAME THING HAVING THEM PLAY DIFFERENT THINGS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL ADDITIONALLY I CANNOT LET THE KIDS LISTEN TO THAT WHILE I LISTEN IT IS ALL THE SAME THING TO 
THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WOULD BE BETTER IF SCREENS WERE BUILT INTO THE SEAT AS A STANDARD OPTION 
THE REAR FACING CAMERA IS TOO DIM AND UNCLEAR 
THE REAR GLASS SLIGHTLY WARPS THE VIEW OF VEHICLES BEHIND YOU AT ABOUT 20 YARDS AWAY AS A RESULT WHEN LOOKING BACK VIA THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND THROUGH THE REAR GLASS SOME CARS AT AROUND 20 YARDS BEHIND LOOK SQUISHED AS THEY GET CLOSER THE 
THE REAR HEAD REST AND HANDLES GET IN THE VIEW WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER TO MAKE SURE THE LANE IS CLEAR IN ORDER TO CHANGE LANES 
THE REAR HEAD RESTRAINTS BLOCK VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REAR I KEEP THE MIDDLE FOLDED DOWN BUT I HAVE PASSENGERS IN THE REAR ON A DAILY BASIS SO THE LEFT AND RIGHT NEED TO REMAIN UP 
THE REAR HEAD RESTS ARE TOO LARGE TO SEE EFFECTIVELY FROM THE DRIVER SEAT WHEN TURNING TO LOOK BEHIND THE VEHICLE 
THE REAR HEAD RESTS DO LIMIT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR VISIBILITY BUT IT S A MINOR THING 
THE REAR HEAD RESTS GET IN THE WAY OF VISIBILITY THEY BLOCK PART OF MY REAR VISION WHEN DRIVING FORWARD 
THE REAR HEAD RESTS SHOULD FOLD DOWN WHEN NO ONE IS IN THE BACK SEAT SO THAT YOU MAY BETTER SEE IN THE REAR
THE REAR HEADRESTS ARE IN THE WAY WHEN TRYING TO LOOK OUT WINDOWS BEHIND DRIVER
THE REAR HEADRESTS BLOCK ALMOST ALL YOUR VIEW OUT THE REAR AND THE PASSENGERS HEADREST BLOCKS YOUR SIDE VISION WE ACTUALLY HAD TO REMOVE THE HEADRESTS FROM THE REAR SEATS SO WE COULD SEE 
THE REAR HEADRESTS BLOCK MY VIEW THE HEADRESTS COULD FOLD DOWN WHEN NOT IN USE 
THE REAR IS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN I LIKE WHEN PASSING/CHANGING LANES
THE REAR OF THE FRAME MAKES IT CHALLENGING TO LOOK TOWARD BLIND SPOTS TO CHANGE LANES BACK UP ETC 
THE REAR OF THIS TRUCK SITS ALOT HIGHER THAN THE 2006 COLORADO I HAD IT S HARDER TO SEE BEHIND OR THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR CORNER A BLIND SPOT
THE REAR PASSENGER HEAD RESTS GET IN THE WAY OF SEEING OUT THE BACK WINDOW TOTALLY 
THE REAR PASSENGER HEADRESTS PARTIALLY OBSTRUCT VIEW OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW THE REAR SEATBELT HANGS DOWN RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REAR WINDOW 
THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE HAS A HUGE BLIND SPOT I AM OFTEN EXTREMELY HESITANT TO MERGE TO THE RIGHT LANE AND IN A CITY THAT IS VERY INCONVENIENT 
THE REAR PILLARS ARE VERY FAT AND THE REAR HEADRESTS ARE HUGE IT MAKES IT HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK 
THE REAR PILLARS ARE WIDE AND MAKE IT SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS BEHIND AND TO THE RIGHT 
THE REAR PILLARS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS PRESENT OR APPROACHING IN THE BLIND SPOTS I DON T THINK A LARGER REVIEW MIRROR WOULD HELP THE REAR WINDOWS NEED TO BE LARGE TO AFFORD DRIVERS A BETTER VIEW 
THE REAR QUADRANTS ARE A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF AND IT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW WHEN SOMEONE IS IN THE MIDDLE SEAT IN BACK WHICH IS ALWAYS AS WE HAVE A TODDLER AND CARSEAT THAT LIVE BACK THERE 
THE REAR QUARTER PANEL VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT BUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS EXCELLENT 
THE REAR QUARTER PANELS ARE TOO OBSTRUCTIVE THE REAR WINDSHIELD IS TOO SMALL 
THE REAR ROOF LINE IS ANGLED IN A WAY THAT RESTRICTS VISIBILITY IT S LIKE YOU CAN ONLY SEE AT A DOWNWARD ANGLE 
THE REAR ROOF POSTS ARE WIDE AND RESTRICT REAR VISIBILITY 
THE REAR SEAT AND HEAD RESTS OBSTRUCT MY VIEW SOMEWHAT
THE REAR SEAT DVD PLAYER SHOULD NOT BE MOUNTED IN THE CENTER OF THE VEHICLE WHEN IN USE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS RENDERED INEFFECTIVE I REALIZED THAT THE ONLY OPTION TO FIX THIS IS TO MOUNT TWO SCREENS DIRECTLY BEHIND EACH OF THE FRONT SEAT A 
THE REAR SEAT ENTERTAINMENT IS SO DIFFICULT TO USE THE CONTROLS ARE HORRIBLE IF YOU HAVE SMALL CHILDREN 1990 S CONNECTIVITY AND WITH THE SCREEN DOWN THE REAR WINDOW MIGHT AS WELL BE METAL AS ITS USELESS 
THE REAR SEAT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS UNACCEPTABLY DIFFICULT TO USE 
THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTRAINTS OBSTRUCT THE DRIVER S REAR VIEW MUCH MORE SO ON MY 2015 XTERRA AS COMPARED TO MY 2011 XTERRA 
THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS MAKE A BIG BLIND SPOT 
THE REAR SEAT HEADREST BLOCKS A PORTION OF THE REAR WINDOW 
THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS BLOCK OUT A GREAT DEAL OF VISION!!!
THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS BLOCK THE VIEW THE SEAT BELT PANELS BLOCK THE VIEW I USE THE REAR CAMERA AND MIRRORS MORE THAN ACTUALLY LOOKING OUT THE REAR WINDOW 
THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS CREATE A DIFFICULT REAR VIEW FOR MY SHORTER SPOUSE
THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS HAVE TO BE DOWN IN ORDER TO SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOW 
THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS SEEMS TO INTERFERE WITH VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW
THE REAR SEAT MIDDLE HEADREST IS A DISTRACTION 
THE REAR SEAT PASSENGER DOOR SILLS ARE TOO HIGH THE VEHICLE IS ALREADY QUITE A TALL VEHICLE FOR SUCH A SMALL SIZE WHEN YOU MATE A TALL VEHICLE WITH REAR DOORS THAT HAVE EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH SILLS THAT MAKES FOR POOR VISIBILITY IT NEEDS TO H 
THE REAR SEAT VIDEO SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO PLAY BLU RAY DISCS 
THE REAR SEAT WINDOWS ARE A LITTLE SMALL OR TOO SLANTED FOR GREAT VISIBILITY
THE REAR SEATS ARE HIGHER THAN THE FRONT SEATS MAKING VISIBILITY FROM THE BACK SEATS GREAT
THE REAR SIDE PASSENGER WINDOW IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF BECAUSE THEY RE VERY SMALL & THE PASSENGER HEADREST AND THE PASSENGER S HEAD GET IN THE WAY 
THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE SMALL AND HIGH MAKING IT HARD TO SEE BLINDSPOTS 
THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE SMALLER FROM WHAT I M USED TO IN MY OLD PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER FOR VISIBILITY AND MORE IMPORTANT IS WHEN THE MIDDLE ROW SEATS ARE COLLAPSED UP AGAINST THE FRONT ROW VISIBILITY IS GREATLY REDUCED 
THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE SO SMALL IT MAKES IT HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES AND BACKING UP USING THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE ALWAYS HELPFUL AND I AM HAVING TO RELY ON THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA MORE OFTEN WHICH IS A NICE FEATURE BUT I LIKE BEING ABLE T 
THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE TINY AND SLOPED DOWN MAKING THE FIELD OF VISION SMALL THE BACK SLOPES DOWN LIMITING THE REAR VIEW THE HEAD RESTS TAKE UP MUCH OF THE FIELD OF VISION ESPECIALLY WITH THE THIRD ROW SEATS 
THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS COULD BE BIGGER THERE IS NO VISIBILITY BETWEEN THE SIDE WINDOWS FRONT TO BACK I M SURE THE SUPPORT BETWEEN THE WINDOWS CONTRIBUTES TO THE CAR S SAFETY RATINGS AND THAT S IMPORTANT 
THE REAR SPOILER INTERFERES WITH THE VIEW WHEN USING THE REARVIEW MIRROR 
THE REAR SPOILER SEVERELY IMPAIRS LOOKING BEHIND YOU HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE A REAR VIEW CAMERA TO HELP COMPENSATE FOR THAT THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR HAS A CONVEX LENS WHICH GREATLY HELPS LOOKING TO YOUR SIDE BECAUSE ITS HARD TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT 
THE REAR SPOILER SHOULD HAVE BEEN RAISED HIGHER SIMILAR TO THE GT3RS 
THE REAR SPOILER THAN IS STANDARD SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE LOW IT S HARD TO SEE BEHIND WHEN DRIVING DOWN A HILL 
THE REAR SPOILER THAT SPLITS THE TWO GLASS PANELS DISTRACTS THE DRIVER S VIEW NOTHING HORRIBLE BUT IT ALWAYS NOTICEABLE THE VELOSTER TURBO SHOULD COME WITH HID HEADLIGHTS THE HALOGEN BULBS ARE VERY OLD TECHNOLOGY FOR A CAR OF THIS CLASS I CH 
THE REAR VEDIO SCREEN ACTUALLY LIMITS REAR VISIBILITY WHE OPERATIONAL 
THE REAR VIE CAMERA SCREEN HAS NO GUIDE BARS FOR BACKING UP I FIND IT ESSENTIALLY USELESS AND DISAPPOINTING TO FIND ON THE RX WHEN MY OLDER CAMRY HAS VERY USEFUL GUIDE BARS TO ASSIST WHEN VIEWING THE REAR CAMERA MONITOR 
THE REAR VIEW AND THE AROUND VIEW CAMERAS GIVE THE DRIVER GOOD VISIBILITY WHEN PARKING OR BACKING UP 
THE REAR VIEW BECAUSE OF SIZE OF BACK SEAT HEADREST AND REAR WINDOWS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CHANGE LANES FROM LEFT TO CENTER OR CENTER TO RIGHT LANE THE VIEW GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE IS A CAR IN THE NEXT LANE WHEN IN EFFECT IT IS THE BACK 
THE REAR VIEW CAM GETS WATER ON IT MAKING IT LESS USEFUL WHEN IT IS RAINING ONLY LIGHTLY 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA GET DIRTY AND GIVE A BLURRED VIEW
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS AN EXCELLENT FEATURE 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS AWESOME NOT ONLY DOES IT ALLOW ME TO AVOID HITTING A SMALL CHILD OR PET THAT WANDERS BEHIND THE VEHICLE BUT IT ALLOWS ME TO BACK UP VERY CLOSE TO AN OBJECT KNOWING THAT I WON T HIT IT I ACTUALLY WISH THERE WERE A FRONT 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS EASY TO USE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS GREAT 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS GREAT BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE I DON T KNOW WHERE THE TWO BACK CORNERS OF THE VEHICLE ARE I VE ONLY 1100 MILES ON IT AND I WAS USED TO DRIVING AN SUV SO I AM STILL GETTING USED TO THE CAR THE CAR IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIGGE 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS INTUITIVE TO USE AND WORKS VERY WELL THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION AND BACK UP RADAR DETECTION SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL THE EYE SIGHT FEATURE WAS SOMETHING THAT I INSISTED ON AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SYSTEM THERE ARE A F 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS MORE USEFUL THAN INITIALLY EXPECTED GIVEN THE LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS VERY CONVENIENT AND MAKES DRIVING A LARGER VEHICLE MUCH SAFER 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS VERY GOOD AND HELPFUL 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS VERY HANDY FOR GETTING AROUND IN PARKING LOTS 
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO BUT IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS HOWEVER I FEEL THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY RELY TO HEAVILY ON IT AND THE DEPTH PERCEPTION OF THE CAMERA S VIEW ISN T THE GREATEST
THE REAR VIEW CENTER MIRROR COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER THE SMALL REAR VIEW CENTER MIRROR IS A BIT SMALL TO WHAT I M USED TO THE SUN SHADE COULD USE A BUILT IN EXTENDERS FOR SUNSHADES 
THE REAR VIEW COULD BE A BIT BETTER BUT NOT AN ISSUE
THE REAR VIEW FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO AS THERE IS A BAR THAT RUNS THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW I HONESTLY DON T NOTICE IT MUCH NOW THAT I HAVE DRIVEN IT FOR A WHILE BUT I COULD SEE IT SCARING NEW CUSTOMERS A LITTLE BIT 
THE REAR VIEW IS BLOCKED BY SPARE TIRE AND REAR WIPER BLADE MOTOR 
THE REAR VIEW IS SEVERELY LIMITED WITH THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM DOWN 
THE REAR VIEW IS SOMEWHAT AWKWARD WITH THE SMALL LOW REAR WINDOW AND THE SOLID PIECE BETWEEN THE REAR WINDOW AND ROOF WINDOW NOT AWFUL JUST AWKWARD
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR APPEARS TO BE MOUNTED UPSIDE DOWN
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCK SOME OF THE FORWARD VISION ALSO AS LOW AS YOU SIT INSIDE THE VEHICLE YOU GET A SMALLER WINDOW OF VIEW OUT THE REAR WINDOW OF COURSE THE REAR VIEW ISSUE IS NOT AN ISSUE WHEN THE CONVERTIBLE TOP IS DOWN 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS DRIVER VISION 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS THE DRIVER S SIGHT TO THE RIGHT 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR CAN BE SMALLER
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR FIELD OF VISION SEEMS TOO SMALL

THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A BIT DIFFICULT TO ADJUST DUE TO THE EYESIGHT UNIT
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A JOKE THE SHAPE IS TOO ODD TO BE USEFUL
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A LITTLE SMALL 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS AWKWARDLY PLACED
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS GREAT BECAUSE I CAN SEE EVERY LANE BEHIND ME WITHOUT OVERLY ADJUSTING IT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE USELESS TO ME I AM TO TALL TO SEE OUT OF THEM ALL I SEE IS THE SIDE OF THE CAR
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS PLACED AT A VERY ODD SPOT IN THE WINDSHIELD IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE AT ALLOWING THE DRIVER TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW THIS LEAVES A 5 6 INCH OR MORE GAP BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD AND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR ON 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS SMALL AND WHILE THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE EXCEPTIONAL I STILL FEEL THERE ARE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDES 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS SMALL JUST ENOUGH FOR THE SMALL REAR WINDOW I HAVE TO USE MY SIDE MIRRORS TO SEE MORE OF MY BLIND SPOTS 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO DARK AT NIGHT LIMITING VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO LARGE REDUCING VISIBILITY TO RIGHT 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO LOW FOR TALL DRIVERS IT BLOCKS SOME OF THE FORWARD VISIBILITY 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL I DON T LIKE THE SMALL SHAPE OF IT 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS WAY TOO SMALL THAT S REALLY MY ONLY VISIBILITY ISSUE WITH THE CAR FOR DRIVING SAFETY I WOULD HAVE LIKE MAYBE THE KIND OF DRIVING ASSIST SYSTEM WHERE IT MAKES A NOISE IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WHEN SWITCHING LANES OR EVEN IF 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS WORTHLESS WHEN ONE OR BOTH TV SCREENS ARE DOWN THE TVS SHOULD BE MOVED OVER 6 8 IN SO THAT THE MIRROR ALLOWS THE DRIVER TO SEE OUT THE REAR 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BLOCKS THE VIEW OF CARS COMING FROM THE RIGHT AFTER STOPPING AT A STOP LIGHT/SIGN I ALWAYS NEED TO LEAN FORWARD AND BACK TO MAKE SURE NO CAR IS COMING 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR S FIELD OF VIEW IS TOO CONFINED ALMOST TUNNEL LIKE 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS SMALL THE CAR HAS SOME WICKED BLIND SPOTS SO THE BLIND SPOT ASSISTANCE FEATURE IS TRULY HELPFUL HOPE THOSE LIGHTS AND SENSORS DON T FAIL!!
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS TO BE MOUNTED TOO LOW ON THE WINDSHIELD AND BLOCKS VISABILITY TO THE RIGHT
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS TO BE PLACED SLIGHTLY TOO LOW FOR A TALL DRIVER CREATING A BLIND SPOT THAT I HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO WORK AROUND 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SHOUD BE A LITTLE LARGER
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SHOULD BE LARGER 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SITS LOW I FIND MY SELF LOOKING AROUND IT AT STOP SIGNS AND TRAFFIC LIGHTS 
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TAKES SOME ADJUSTMENT TO GET USED TO IT IT SEEMED SMALL AND DARK AT FIRST NOW I VE ADAPTED TO IT BUT IT COULD BE IMPROVED BY BEING A BIT LARGER 
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE EXCELLENT THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO BLIND SPOTS ALSO THE HEADLIGHTS ARE FANTASTIC THEY LIGHT UP THE ROAD WITH OUT BLINDING ON COMING VEHICLES 
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE PLACED TOO FAR TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE CAR THEY WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF THEY WERE CLOSER TO THE FRONT DOOR HINGES AS AN AVERAGE HEIGHT FEMALE 5 4 WITH A MANUAL TRANSMISSION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CLUTCH I HAVE TO 
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE SO LARGE AND PLACED IN SUCH MANNER THAT SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE AROUND/OVER THEM 
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO BIG AND ARE HARD TO SEE AROUND WHEN TURNING ONTO ROADS WITH MEDIANS
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VIEW VEHICLES COMING ALONG SIDE OF ME 
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS INCLUDE A USEFUL MIRROR WITHIN THE MIRROR THAT VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE THE BLINDSPOT OF THE VEHICLE ALLOWING ME TO SEE CARS THAT I OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE 
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS KIND OF BLOCKS THE CAR TO YOUR LEFT WHEN MAKING A FULL STOP IN A FOUR WAY STOP STREET 
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SEEM INADEQUATE EITHER IN SIZE OR STYLING CAN T TELL 
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SEEM TO BE IN THE DIRECT LINE OF SIGHT WHEN CHANGING LANES OR GOING AROUND CORNERS THE SUN VISORS ARE FAIRLY USELESS 
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SEEM VERY LARGE SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE THEY OBSTRUCT MY SIGHT LINE 
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SHOW BLIND SPOT CARS BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS MURANO
THE REAR VIEW THROUGH THE HATCH WINDOW IS VERY NARROW HOWEVER I GOT USED TO IT VERY QUICKLY I HAD READ ABOUT THIS IN CONSUMER REPORTS SO IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I CONSIDERED CAREFULLY BEFORE BUYING THE CAR THE CAR IS SMALL ENOUGH THA 
THE REAR VIEW WINDOW CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF 
THE REAR VISIBILITY AND BLIND SPOTS ARE NOTTGREAT
THE REAR VISIBILITY COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS A VALUABLE AID 
THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT THRU THE BACK WINDOW SEEMS VERY DARK MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE FOLLOWING VEHICLES 
THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT IS TOO SMALL 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS AWFUL 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT FROM THE DRIVER SEAT WHEN THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS ARE UP YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM DOWN TO SEE WELL 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS EXTREMALY POOR THEREFORE HAZARDOUS WHIS THESE TYPE OF MODELS IT IS NECESARY A REAR BACKUP CAMERA FABRIC INSTALLED 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS FAIRLY POOR IT IS HARD TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE THE REAR CORNERS OF THE VEHICLE ARE ALSO THERE IS QUITE A LARGE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES AND A SLIGHTLY SMALLER ONE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHA 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS IMPAIRED AND ITS DIFFICULT TO SEE LOWER OBJECTS IN THE FRONT 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS LIMITED DUE TO REAR TIRE BACK UP CAMERA WOULD RESOLVE THIS HEADLIGHTS WAS REPORTED IN PREVIOUS PART OF SURVEY BUT NOT DEFECTED THEY ARE NOT UP TO MY PERSONAL REQUIREMENTS AFTERMARKET LIGHTS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT BECAUSE OF THE SPOILER AND THE BACK BEING A BIT HIGHER BUT THE REAR VIEW CAMERA REALLY MAKES UP FOR IT 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT NECESSARY A PROBLEM IT REQUIRES AT LEAST TWO ATTEMPTS LOOKING OUT THE BACK PRIOR TO CHANGING LANES 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT VERY GOOD 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS REDUCED BY NOT HAVING THE SMALL CONVEX MIRRORS AS PART OF THE SIDE MIRRORS 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS SPLIT BY THE HATCH SYSTEM AND MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE HOWEVER SETTING THE REARVIEW MIRROR CORRECTLY AND FAMILIARITY WITH THE CAR MAKES THIS A MINOR PROBLEM FOR SAFE DRIVING 
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS THE WORST FEATURE DUE TO A SMALL BACK WINDOW AND STRUCTURE OF CAR CREATES BLIND SPOTS WHICH IS HELPED A BIT BY THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS UNFORTUNATELY THESE ARE NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ACCURATE AND PULLS UP FALSE ALARMS
THE REAR VISIBILITY ISN T GREAT BUT COMING FROM A CONVERTIBLE IT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT I WAS USED TO THIS IS NOT A DETRACTION FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE EXCELLENT CAMERA SYSTEM WHICH IS BETTER THAN ANY AMOUNT OF REAR VISIBILITY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 
THE REAR VISIBILITY ISSUE IS WHAT I REFERENCED IN THE SEAT SECTION IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE NOT THAT THE REAR SEAT REST HAVE BEEN RAISED FROM MY 2006 MODEL
THE REAR VISIBILITY NEEDS TO BE INCREASED WINDOW IS TOO SMALL 
THE REAR VISIBILITY ON THE TLX IS MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER SEDANS THAT I TESTED 
THE REAR VISIBILITY STRAIGHT BEHIND THE CAR ISN T BAD BUT VIEWING REARWARDS AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THE BACK UP CAMERA HELPS SIGNIFICANTLY
THE REAR VISIBILITY THOUGH THE REAR MIRROR IS EXTREMELY LIMITED THE REAR PILLARS AND CENTER PILLARS BLOCK THE VIEW WHILE LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER THE THICKNESS OF THE FRONT PILLARS AND ANGLE CAN MARKING PARKING DIFFICULT 
THE REAR VISION CAMERA GETS DIRTY VERY QUICKLY RENDERING IT LESS EFFECTIVE 
THE REAR VISION CAMERA IS IN A POOR SPOT AND IS ALWAYS DIRTY AND IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE OUT OF
THE REAR WINDOW AND THE REAR CAMERA LENS GET COVERED WITH DIRT VERY QUICKLY WHEN DRIVING ON DIRT ROADS 
THE REAR WINDOW COMES DOWN IN THE BACK A LITTLE TO LOW FROM WERE I SIT IN THE DRIVERS SEAT COMFORTABLE DRIVING POSITION BUT I HAVE TO STOOP A LITTLE TO SEE IN MIRROR OUT BACK WINDOW REALLY NOT A BIGGY I KNOW IT IS BECAUSE OF HOW I HAVE THE SEAT 
THE REAR WINDOW COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER ALSO THE PASSENGER REAR SIDE WINDOW COULD BE BIGGER 
THE REAR WINDOW COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER IT IS TOO SMALL
THE REAR WINDOW FEELS FAIRLY NARROW COMPARED TO THE RX AND VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD 
THE REAR WINDOW HAS EXTREMELY LIMITED RANGE OF VISION A CAMERA WHEN BACKING IS NEEDED 
THE REAR WINDOW HEIGHT COULD BE INCREASED AND OR THE TRUNK LOWERED
THE REAR WINDOW IS A BIT SMALL 
THE REAR WINDOW IS A LITTLE LOW DOWN MEANING THAT IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT EXTENDER FURTHER UP THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE THE FRAME ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD CAN BLOCK VISION FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE BUT THE VEHICLE SAFETY FEATURES HELP COMBAT TH 
THE REAR WINDOW IS A LITTLE SMALL AND VISIBILITY SEEMS LIMITED BUT I AM GETTING USED TO IT 
THE REAR WINDOW IS A LITTLE SMALL BUT I WAS USED TO A BIGGER VEHICLE I CAN STILL SEE WELL REGARDLESS 
THE REAR WINDOW IS HALF THE SIZE OF PREVIOUS MODELS WHICH REDUCES THE VISIBILITY TREMENDOUSLY 
THE REAR WINDOW IS KIND OF HARD TO SEE OUT OF 
THE REAR WINDOW IS KIND OF HARD TO SEE OUT OF IF YOU WANT LOOK FAR BEHIND YOU WITHOUT HUNCHING WAY DOWN YOU CAN T SEE MORE THEN ABOUT 20 FEET THIS HAPPENS EVEN IF THE SEAT HEIGHT IS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE SIDE MIRRORS WORK VERY WELL AND ARE VERY 
THE REAR WINDOW IS NARROW AND WITH THE HEADRESTS OF THE BACK SEATS IT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE 
THE REAR WINDOW IS QUITE SMALL I REALLY CAN T SEE OTHER CARS WHEN CHANGING LANES SO I HAVE TO TURN ALL THE WAY AROUND AND LOOK THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT THE REAL DISTANCE OF CAR IN SIDE MIRROR AND APPEARANCE OF DISTANCE IS VERY LARGE 
THE REAR WINDOW IS RELATIVELY SMALL NOT GIVING GREAT VISABILITY

THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL 
THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL AND I HAVE REMOVED THE REAR HEADRESTS FOR EASIER VIEWING SINCE I NEVER HAVE REAR SEAT PASSENGERS 
THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL AND THE IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER SIDE 
THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL AND THIS GIVES GREAT STYLING BUT DOES HAMPER VISIBILITY A LITTLE THE REAR WIPER IS MINUTE WHICH DOESNT HELP IN REALLY WET WEATHER 
THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL AND VISIBILITY IS LIMITED AT TIMES BECAUSE OF THE POSITIONING OF THE REAR HEAD RESTS 
THE REAR WINDOW IS TOO SMALL BUT WITH THE EXCELLENT SIDE MIRRORS YOU ARE ABLE TO SEE EVERYTHING AROUND YOU IN ORDER TO BE SAFE 
THE REAR WINDOW IS VERY SMALL LIMITING THE VISIBILITY OF IT WHEN BACKING UP OR CHECKING YOUR REAR MIRROR 
THE REAR WINDOW MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I NEED ABOUT ONE TO TWO INCHES MORE VIEWING HEIGHT I DON T QUITE SEE AS MUCH TRAFFIC THRU THE REARVIEW MIRROR AS I WOULD LIKE 
THE REAR WINDOW NEEDS TO BE RE ENGINEERED FOR SOME INSANE REASON THAT WINDOW GETS DIRTY WHEN NO OTHER WINDOW DOES AND WHEN IT IS DIRTY IT S OF LITTLE OR NO USE AS A REFERENCE YES THE LITTLE WIPER HELPS BUT IS INADEQUATE TO KEEP THAT VERY I 
THE REAR WINDOW NEEDS WIPER BLADES
THE REAR WINDOW PIECE THAT SEPERATED WINDOWS GETS IN THE WAY ALOT
THE REAR WINDOW RESTRICTS VISIBILITY
THE REAR WINDOW SEEMS TO BE TOO SMALL FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT AND IS AT A STRANGE ANGLE 
THE REAR WINDOW SHOULD BE BIGGER
THE REAR WINDOW TAKES ON WATER WHEN IT IS WET OUTSIDE WHICH MAKES IT HARD TO KEEP THE REAR WINDOW CLEAN 
THE REAR WINDOW TENDS TO GET DIRTY VERY FAST I E THE ROAD DUST QUICKLY ACCUMULATES FASTER THAN ANY OTHER WAGON/SUV I HAVE HAD 
THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR 
THE REAR WINDOW WASHER SEEMS TO POINT TOWARD THE WIPER BASE INSTEAD OF THE ARM I LL ASK THE DEALER ABOUT THAT WHEN I GET IT S FIRST SERVICE
THE REAR WINDOW WHEN IT GETS FROSTED DOESN T DEFROST MAKING IT HARD TO SEE CARS IN MY REAR VIEW WINDOWS BLIND SPOT 
THE REAR WINDOW WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE TOO SORT AND ONLY CLEAN BARELY HALF OF THE WINDOW
THE REAR WINDOW WIPER SHOULD CLEAR MORE OF THE GLASS I E BE LARGER WHEN IT TURNS OFF THERE IS ALSO A NOISE AS IT TUCKS ITSELF AWAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT S BROKEN 
THE REAR WINDOW WIPER SWIPES TOO SMALL AN AREA 
THE REAR WINDOW/WIPER IS INADEQUATE IT DOESN T HELP MUCH AT ALL 
THE REAR WINDOWS ARE TOO SMALL CANNOT SEE OUT ENOUGH WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE REAR WINDSHIELD DOESN T GIVE A TON OF VISIBILITY BEHIND THE CAR THE DESIGN AND LOOK OF THE CAR FROM THE OUTSIDE ARE EXCEPTIONAL SO I WOULDN T NECESSARILY CONSIDER ALTERING IT TOO MUCH BUT AT TIMES IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS VERY LITTLE SPACE B 
THE REAR WINDSHIELD FEELS LIKE IT S PLACED REALLY LOW AND CAN BE HARD TO SEE OUT OF I AM VERY SHORT SO I IMAGINE IT S EVEN MORE OF A PROBLEM FOR SOMEONE EVEN OF AVERAGE HEIGHT 
THE REAR WINDSHIELD GETS DIRTY VERY FAST DUE TO THE WAY THE JEEP IS DESIGNED 
THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER IS A BIT SMALL AND DOES NOT CLEAR THE WHOLE WINDOW 
THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER IS USELESS 
THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER PARTIALLY OBSTRUCTS THE VIEW TO THE REAR 
THE REAR WING BLOCKS REARVIEW MIRROR
THE REAR WIPER DOES NOT CLEAR A LARGE AREA
THE REAR WIPER DOESN T WIPE AS MUCH OF THE REAR WINDOW AS I WOULD LIKE BUT OVERALL THIS IS ALL QUITE GOOD 
THE REAR WIPER SHOULD BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDOW FOR OPTIMUM VISION WHEN IN USE THE LOWER LEFT ISN T CLEAR AND I WOULD RATHER SEE THE LOWER SIDES THAN THE UPPER 
THE REAR WIPER SHOULD COVER MOR AREA 
THE REAR WIPER SPRAYER IS PRETTY WEAK 
THE REAR WIPER SYSTEM IS WEAK DOES NOT CLEAN WELL 
THE REAR WIPER/WASHER IS TERRIBLE IT IS TOO SMALL 
THE REAR WIPERS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS THE FRONT WIPERS
THE REAR/LANE CHANGE VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT HOWEVER I CAN ACCEPT THIS DUE TO THE SPORT NATURE OF THE VEHICLE 
THE REAR/SIDE VISIBILITY ON THE DRIVER S SIDE IS NON EXISTENT I M CERTAIN THAT S WHY THEY PUT A BUILT IN FISH EYE MIRROR IN THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR 
THE REARMOST SIDE WINDOWS TEND TO DECREASE SIDE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE REARVIEW CAMERA COULD A LITTLE BETTER IN COLOR CLARITY AND COULD USE CROSS TRAFFIC IN REAR BACKING
THE REARVIEW CAMERA IS USELESS IN RAINY CONDITIONS WATER DROPLETS OBSCURE THE CAMERA VIEW 
THE REARVIEW MIRROR BLOCKING VIEW OUT
THE REARVIEW MIRROR CREATES A MASSIVE BLINDSPOT FOR THE DRIVER I M NOT TALL ONLY 6 EVEN BUT I HAVE TO DUCK MY HEAD OR MOVE TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT TO SEE CARS THAT WOULD BE APPROACHING AT 90 DEGREES TO MY RIGHT WHEN CLOSING ON AN INTERSECTION 
THE REARVIEW MIRROR MAKES TRAFFIC IMAGES SMALLER THAN THEY ARE 
THE REARVIEW MIRROR WHICH IS MOUNTED ON THE WINDSHIELD SHOULD BE ADJUSTABLE HIGHER OR LOWER TO ACCOMMODATE THE DRIVER THERE SHOULD BE A SET SCREW WHICH WILL ALLOW THE DRIVER TO SLIDE THE MIRROR UPWARDS TOWARDS THE ROOF AS TO ALLOW BETTER VISIBI 
THE REARVIEW MIRRORS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE NORM BUT I LIKE THEM AND THEY ARE EFFECTIVE
THE REARWARD VISIBILITY OF THE CAR IS HAMPERED BY LOW SEATING POSITION AND THE HIGH SHOULDERS OF THE REAR END BUT THE SKINNY PEDAL MAKES SURE THAT YOU RE WELL AHEAD OF ANYTHING LURKING IN THE LANE NEXT TO YOU AND THAT S REASSURING 
THE REASON FOR AN AVERAGE RATING FOR THE SUN VISORS BESIDES SIDING TO BLOCK THE SUN THEY SHOULD ALSO HAVE A PULL DOWN SCREEN TO BLOCK THE SUN WHEN IT IS BELOW THE LOWER EDGE OF THE VISOR 
THE REASON FOR REPORTING ANY VISIBILITY PROBLEMS IS THE FACT THAT THE VERY STUPID HEAD RESTS ARE IN THE WAY DRIVER PASSENGER 2ND ROW SEATS AND 3RD ROW SEATS HAVE HEAD RESTS THAT ARE TOO LARGE I WOULD GUESS THAT PROBABLY MOST NEW VEHICLES HAVE 
THE REASON I CHOSE THE VW TIGUAN IS BECAUSE IT IS ROOMY AND SEEMS TO HAVE MORE WEIGHT THAN OTHER SUVS ALSO I LIKE THE APPEARANCE THIS IS MY SECOND TIGUAN 
THE REASON I LIKE SUV S IS FOR THE HEIGHT AND ADDED VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING IN TRAFFIC THIS MODEL WAS REDESIGNED AND NOW I AM MORE AT THE LEVEL OF A CAR THAN AN SUV SO VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD 
THE REASON THE VISIBILITY IS IS NOT A PROBLEM IS THE EXCEPTIONAL FEATURES ON THE CAR LIKE THE CHANGE LANE SIGNAL AND THE REAR CAMERA AND BEEPERS THAT HELPS THE DRIVER TO NAVIGATE TRAFFIC WITHOUT MANY IF ANY PROBLEMS THE AUDI Q3 IS A GREAT CAR 
THE REASONS I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE WAS BECAUSE OF THE SLEEK SPORTY DESIGN AND THE HISTORICAL SAFETY FACTOR THAT COMES WITH A VOLVO CAR 
THE REASOUN I GAVE REAR VISABILITY A 6 IS BEACUASE WITH THE THIRS ROW HEAD RESTS UP THERE IS LIMITED VIEW THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BUT IT IS NOT THAT BAD I JUST TRY TO KEEP THE HEAD RESTS DOWN UNLESS THERE IS A PASSANGER IN THE THRID ROW SETA 
THE RECEPTION FOR THE SIRIUS/XM RADIO PORTION IS POOR GET A LOT OF NO SIGNAL INDICATORS THE LIVE TRAFFIC INDICATOR HAS BEEN RESET MORE THAN 3 TIMES ALREADY THE TRAFFIC OR COLLISION ICONS DON T SHOW UP ON THE MAP ITSELF I GET THE COLORED L 
THE RECEPTION OF THE FM RADIO SIGNAL 
THE RECEPTION OF THE PHONE IS VERY GRAVELY 
THE RECEPTION WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM ISN T DLEAR WHEN DRIVING TOO MUCH WIND NOISE FROM THE OUSTSIDE EVEN WITH THE WINDOWS SEALED TIGHT AND NO AIR CIRCULATING INSIDE THE VEHICLE 
THE RECEPTIVITY OF THE RADIO IS NOT ESPECIALLY GOOD ESPECIALLY WITH THE LOCAL NPR AND CLASSICAL STATIONS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE STRONGEST SIGNALS 
THE RECOGNITION IS NOT GREAT 
THE RED COLOR IS DISTRACTING/MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE OLDER WHITE/GREENISH LIGHTING TO SEE IN A DARKENED VEHICLE PLACING SO MUCH INFORMATION AND NOT ALWAYS USER FRIENDLY ICONS IN THE CONSOLE REQUIRES TOO MUCH LOOKING AWAY FROM THE ROAD THE STEE 
THE RED LIGHTING OF THE AUDIO COMPONENTS IS POOR HARD TO READ AND DOES NOT LOOK GOOD
THE REDESIGNED WINDOWS GREATLY IMPROVE VISIBILITY 
THE REDUCTION IN SIZE OF THE MIRRORS FROM THE PREVIOUS GENERATION WAS NOT A GOOD THING IN REGARDS TO VISIBILITY BIGGER MIRRORS PLEASE 
THE REDUNDANT NATURE OF SOME OF THE CONTROLS BEING ON THE DASHBOARD AS PART OF THE TOUCH SCREEN AND BEING ON THE STEERING WHEEL AS A PHYSICAL LEVER 
THE REFLECTION OF THE DASH INTO THE WINDSHIELD IS A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM I WOULD NOT BUY THIS CAR WITH A BEIGE DASH AGAIN GIVEN THE CHOICE 
THE REGULAR DRIVING LIGHTS ARE DO NOT POINT FAR ENOUGH
THE REIW VIEW MIRRORS ON THE WD SHOULD BE STANDARD AWESOME VISION!
THE RELATIVE EASE OF USE TO GO BETWEEN FUNCTIONS WITH IDRIVE
THE REMOTE CONTROLLED ABILITY OF THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT
THE REMOTE TO THE REAR TV IS VERY HARD TO NAVIGATE THE MENUS 
THE RESOLUTION AND SIZE OF THE NAV SCREEN IS EXCELLENT INPUTTING THE ADDRESS TO LOOK FOR IS VERY EASY 
THE RESPONSE BY THE SYSTEM IS FAR TOO SLOW I CAN USE THE WAZE APP AND GET DIRECTIONS FASTER AND WITH MORE ACCURACY THAN THE SYSTEM IN THE CAR THE NAV SYSTEM DOESN T AUTO ADJUST AS TRAFFIC CHANGES ALONG THE ROUTE JUST UNACCEPTABLE FOR A VEHIC 
THE RESPONSE OF THE SYSTEM IS SLOWER THAN I PREFER IN THE NAVIGATION THERE ARE TWO CONFIRMATION STEPS WHEN SELECTING A DESTINATION FOR EXAMPLE IF I CHOOSE MY HOME I SHOULDN T HAVE TO SELECT IT AGAIN 
THE RESPONSE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IS TOO SLOW I DON T LIKE THE VOICE ACTIVATION SYSTEM
THE RESPONSE TIME IS A BIT SLOW 
THE RESPONSE TIME OF THE CONTROLS ARE A LITTLE SLOW IN REACTING FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ADJUSTING VOLUME THERE IS A DELAY IN RESPONSE THE NAVAGATION NEEDS SOME WORK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE ADDRESS TO BE DISPLAYED WHEN NEARING YOUR DESTINATION ESPE 
THE RESPONSIVENESS OF THE SYSTEM IS SLUGGISH THERE IS A SOMEWHAT SIGNIFICANT DELAY BETWEEN PUSHING A BUTTON AND THE SYSTEM RESPONDING WHICH CAN BE FRUSTRATING
THE REST
THE RETRO DESIGN HAS ITS VISIBILITY LIMITATIONS BUILT IN BUT I BOUGHT THE CAR KNOWING THAT AND FIND IT TERRIFIC TO DRIVE 
THE REVIEW MIRRORS ARE MASSIVE VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING 
THE REVIEWS ARE ACCURATE THE BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGE 
THE RIDE IS SMOOTH AND COMFORTABLE
THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES OF THE WINDSHIELD SEEM OVERLY WIDE CAUSING SOME VISIBILITY ISSUES 
THE RIGHT FRONT DOOR POST/SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS WIDE AND I HAVE TROUBLE SEEING ONCOMING TRAFFIC FROM MY RIGHT 
THE RIGHT SEAT HIEGHT TRUCKS OVERALL HIEGHT VISIBILITY FROM ALL ANGLES MIRRIOR HIEGHT DOES NOT BLOCK VIEW FRONT HOOD IS SLOPED DOWN FOR A GOOD FORWARD VISIBILITY AND STYLE 
THE RIGHT SIDE BLIND SPOT CAMERA FOR MAKING RIGHT TURNS IT S A LIFESAVER 
THE RIGHT SIDE FORWARD BLIND SPOT CAUSED BY THE ROOF SUPPORT IS LARGER THAN I ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED 
THE RIGHT SIDE WALL CONSTRUCTION LEAVES A BIG BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING TO THE RIGHT FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT 
THE RIGHT TURN REAR CAMERA IS GREAT SHOULD HAVE THE SAME FOR LEFT TURN
THE RIGHT WIPER IS STRANGE BUT IT WORKS FINE 
THE RIGHTSIDE REAR BODY CAUSED SOME DISTRACTION WHEN LOOKING THROUGH THE REARVIEW MIRROR IT FELT LIKE ANOTHER VEHICLE WAS THERE I RE ADJUSTED THE MIRROR A BIT SO THAT I DONT SEE THAT AND NOW IT S GOOD 
THE RIGTH BACK HEAD REST CAUSES A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT 
THE RINGTONE IN THE WAY TOO LOUD AND HARD TO ADJUST 
THE RIVETS/BUMPS ALONG THE HOOD AND TRUNK FOR IMPACT
THE ROAD NOISE OF THE VEHICLE DROWNS OUT THE BLUE TOOTH MAYBE LOWER THE ROAD NOISE OR ALLOW LOUDER BLUE TOOTH 
THE ROCKER KNOB CAN BE HARD TO USE AT TIMES TAKES A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MEMORIZE AND THEN RECALL FAVORITE STATIONS AND TO GET INFO ON THE MUSIC YOU ARE LISTENING TO THIS IS NOT AT ALL INTUITIVE 
THE ROCKFORD FOSGATE SOUND SYSTEM IS AWESOME!
THE ROCKFORD FOSGATE SOUND SYSTEM IS STRONG 
THE ROOF IS NARROWER THAN THE BOTTOM OF THE CAR SO WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOORS IN RAIN WATER DRIPS ON THE SEAT 
THE ROOF IS VERY LOW LMAKING THE VISORS HARD TO SEE OUT OF WHEN THEY ARE DOWN ALL THE WAY 
THE ROOF SUPPORTS OBSTRUCT MY VISION TO SOME EXTENT 
THE ROTARY INTERFACE OF THE RNS315 IS SHOWY MORE THAN FUNCTIONAL THIS IS ESPECIALLY APPARENT WHEN BROWSING THROUGH LONG PLAYLISTS AND WHEN TRYING TO SEEK TO A SPECIFIC POSITION WITHIN A PLAYING TRACK 
THE ROUND BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS MIRRORS
THE ROUNDED FRONT BUMPERS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO GAUGE DISTANCE OR CURBS AND OTHER VEHICLES
THE ROUTE GUIDANCE COULD BE EASIER MORE INTUITIVE I HAVE USED LOTS OF GPS DEVICES BUT I STILL HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO PROGRAM A DESTINATION ONCE I READ THE MANUAL I ASSUME I LL BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT IT S NOT INTUITIVE 
THE ROUTE GUIDANCE OCCASIONALLY SENDS ME TO THE WRONG PLACE
THE ROUTES THAT THE NAVIGATION PICKS CAN BE RATHER STRANGE AND DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS MY TABLET AND SMARTPHONE THE NAVIGATION SHOULD PEROXIDE MULTIPLE ROUTES TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN YOU ASK FOR DIRECTIONS TO A DESTINATION 
THE ROUTING OF DIRECTIONS THE DETOURS AROUND TRAFFIC ARE COMPLETELY USELESS IT TELLS YOU TO TAKE EACH EXIT AND THEN GET BACK ON THE HIGHWAY YOU END UP SITTING IN MORE TRAFFIC BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC ON RAMPS AND MERGING TRAFFIC 
THE ROUTINGS SOMETIMES ARE CIRCUITOUS AND DON T MAKE SENSE THE SYSTEM DOESN T KNOW THAT WHILE THE ADDRESS IS ON A MAJOR HIGHWAY THERE IS AN ACCESS ROAD TO TAKE YOU THERE IT SHOULD KNOW YOU DON T ACCESS THE BUSINESS BY THE STREET ADDRESS YOU A 
THE RS5 IS THE MOST ROCK SOLID DRIVING CAR I VE EVER OWNED IN OVER 45 YEARS OF OWNING CARS 
THE RUGGED LOOK
THE SAFEST I HAVE EVER FELT WHEN CHANGING LANES THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE THE BEST YET!
THE SAFETY AND CONVENIENCE OF USING PHONE FOR VOICE AND TEXTING 
THE SAFETY AND EASE FOR THE DRIVER TO USE THE SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING 
THE SAFETY FEATURE IS THE BEST 
THE SAFETY FEATURES AND ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS ARE GREAT 
THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE REMARKABLE NOTHING HAS BEEN LEFT OUT!
THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE SPECTACULAR LANE DEPARTURE WARNING BLIND SPOT WARNING AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL HARE MOST APPRECIATED 
THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE VERY HELPFUL 
THE SAFETY FEATURES IN MY IMPALA SHOULD BE STANDARD IN ALL NEW CHEVROLET VEHICLES 
THE SAFETY FEATURES OF THIS VEHICLE ARE TRULY AMAZING AND EASY TO USE 
THE SAFETY OF THE VOICE COMMAND 
THE SAFETY OF VEHICLE WAS ANOTHER KEY FACTOR IN PURCHASE DECISION
THE SAFETY THAT HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION AFFORDS 
THE SAFETYTEC SYSTEM IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL
THE SAME AS ANSWERED BEFORE I HAVE HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH THE PANDORA APP AND HAVE HAD TO STREAM PANDORA ON MY PHONE USING IT AS A MEDIA DEVICE CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH INSTEAD OF USING THE APP BECAUSE OF ISSUES WITH THE UCONNECT EVEN WHILE BOTH M 
THE SATALITE RADIO 
THE SATELITE RADIO IS GREAT I NEVER LOSE THE STATION I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LINCOLN BRING BACK THE JUKE BOX FEATURE THAT THEY HAD IN 2010 
THE SATELLITE CONNECTION IS WEAK AND OFTEN CUTS OUT DURING AUDIO PLAYBACK 
THE SATELLITE RADIO
THE SATELLITE RADIO CUTS OUT MULTIPLE TIMES DAILY EVEN WHEN IN OPEN AIR THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY WERE WORKING ON A SOLUTION BUT HAVE NOT CONTACTED ME TO REPLACE THE ANTENNA 
THE SATELLITE RADIO HAS POOR RECEPTION AND SOMETIMES LOSES RECEPTION THIS SURPRISED ME AS I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION IT WAS SUPERIOR 
THE SATELLITE RADIO IS FANTASTIC THE BLUETOOTH FROM MY PHONE ALSO CONNECTS ALMOST INSTANTLY WHEN I GET IN THE VEHICLE WITH NO HICCUPS TO SPEAK OF 
THE SATELLITE RADIO IS WAY TOO BASIC CAN T SET FAVORITES AND CAN T SEE A VOLUME DISPLAY REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT 
THE SATELLITE RADIO IT IS THE ONLY THING I USE 
THE SATELLITE RADIO ON THE CAR WAS NOT WORKING WHEN I BOUGHT IT BUT I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I WENT HOME B/C NO ONE WENT OVER THE CONTROLS W/ ME WHEN I PURCHASED 
THE SATELLITE RADIO SHOWS A LOT OF INFO CHANNEL SONG ARTIST UNLIKE OTHERS I VE SEEN 
THE SAVED CHANNELS FOR RADIO XW ET AL ARE DIFFICULT TO USE BECAUSE THEY ARE MAINTAINED IN A LIST THAT IS NOT IN NUMERICAL OR ALPHABETICAL ORDER WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO FIND SPECIFIC SAVED CHANNELS ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING IT WOULD BE HELPF 
THE SAVED RADIO STATIONS DO NOT WORK WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL BUTTONS
THE SCALE OF THE MAP ISN T THE BEST ALONG WITH THE STREET NAME DEPICTED ON THE SCREEN I USE MY IPHONE ALTHOUGH I WOULD RATHER USE THE CAR S SYSTEM
THE SCAN BUTTON ON STEERING WHEEL SEEMS TO MOVE ONLY TO PREPROGRAMMED RADIO STATIONS INSTEAD OF ALLOWING ME TO SCAN TO A NEXT STATION ON RADIO DIAL 
THE SCAN FEATURE COULD BE LIKE MORE TRADITIONAL 
THE SCION HEADUNIT IS ONE OF THE BEST AND EASY TO USE
THE SCREE COULD HAVE A BETTER QUALITY DISPLAY
THE SCREEN
THE SCREEN ALLOWS FOR MULTIPLE VIEWS AND MAKES IT EASY TO CHOSE THE FEATURE YOU NEED TO ACCESS THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO GLARE ON THE SCREEN FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES WHICH MAKES IT VERY EASY TO READ 
THE SCREEN AND DISPLAYS OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND FOLLOW 
THE SCREEN AND SCREEN LOCATION AND SIZE 
THE SCREEN CAN BE MADE A BIT LARGER THAN THE 7 THE SCREEN CAN ALSO USE TOUCH CAPABILITY 
THE SCREEN CLARITY AND ABILITY TO VIEW ELECTRICITY RANGE AND CONSUMPTION 
THE SCREEN CONTINUALLY ROTATES ABOUT THE STATION INFORMATION I ASSUME BECAUSE IT IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO POST A SINGLE LINE 
THE SCREEN COULD BE A TAD BIGGER AND MORE RESPONSIVE
THE SCREEN COULD BE BIGGER SO THAT THE WORDS AND INSTRUCTIONS ON THE SCREEN CAN BE BETTER SEEN
THE SCREEN DISPLAY COULD BE DESIGNED BETTER 
THE SCREEN DISPLAY IS COUNTER INTUITIVE I DO NOT USE THE BUILT PHONE AS I HAVE MY I PHONE FOR CALLS THE TEXT MESSAGE CONTROLS DO NOTHING FOR BLUE TOOTH PHONE COMMUNICATION I HAVE TO START THE COMMANDS BY USING THE PHONE FOLLOWED BY THE SIRI VOI 
THE SCREEN DISPLAY PRIMARILY WHEN USING THE NAVIGATION UNIT FOR MAP DISPLAY COMPARED TO OUR OTHER VEHICLE HYUNDAI GENESIS THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY IN THIS VEHICLE IS WELL BELOW STANDARD 
THE SCREEN DOES NOT LIST WHAT IS PLAYING ON OTHER SATELLITE STATIONS AS THE BMW SYSTEM DOES 
THE SCREEN FOR THE RADIO TIME AND TEMP YOU CAN T READ IT WHILE YOU DRIVE OR EVEN IN THE PASSENGER S SEAT THE SUN FADES IT OUT IN THE DAYTIME ALSO I DO NOT HAVE A COMPASS IN THE CAR AND I THINK THAT IS IN IMPORTANT FOR CITY DRIVING I D 
THE SCREEN HAS A DEAD SPOT WHEN VIEWED THRU POLARIZED SUNGLASSES ALSO FOR MAPS THE SCREEN REALLY SHOULD BE PORTRAIT STYLE RATHER THAN LANDSCAPE I E TALLER THAN IT IS WIDE 
THE SCREEN HAS GREATLY IMPROVED SINCE OWNING A 2012 TUCSON MUCH BETTER PLACEMENT AND VISIBILITY GOOD JOB!
THE SCREEN IS AN EXCELLENT SIZE AND IF I CANT READ SOMETHING IN NAV I JUST ZOOM IN LOVE THAT FEATURE
THE SCREEN IS AWFUL THE INTEGRATION OF APPS IS SUBPAR 
THE SCREEN IS EASILY READABLE USING ANY OF THE DEVICES 
THE SCREEN IS EASY TO NAVAGATE THROUGH FOR DIFFERENT CONTROLS I USE
THE SCREEN IS EASY TO READ 
THE SCREEN IS EASY TO READ AND YOU CAN DISPLAY 3 SCREENS AT THE SAME TIME I ALSO LIKE THE OPTION OF HAVING THE NAV APPEAR DIRECTLY BEHIND THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN YOU MOVE THAT SECTION TO THE RIGHT 
THE SCREEN IS EXCEPTIONAL AND THE USER INTERFACE IS THE EASIEST I HAVE EVER USED
THE SCREEN IS GORGEOUS AND RESPONSIVE 
THE SCREEN IS HARD TO READ BECAUSE OF GLARE ON THE SCREEN ACTUALLY CAN T READ MANY TIMES CAN T SEE THE BACK UP AID MOST OF THE TIME 
THE SCREEN IS HUGE AND SO EASY TO SEE/READ
THE SCREEN IS LARGE BUT SOME OF THE SCREEN IS BLOCKED BY THE STEERING WHEEL 
THE SCREEN IS LARGE ENOUGH TO SEE EASILY FOR USING THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS THE COLORS ARE BRIGHT AND CLEAR THE DAY AND NIGHT VIEWS ARE EQUALLY EASY TO USE THE SOUND OF THE AUDIO IS VERY CRISP AND CLEAR 
THE SCREEN IS NOT ROTATED TOWARD THE DRIVER THE SCREEN IS TOO FAR FORWARD FOR COMFORTABLE VIEWING I SUGGEST THE SCREEN ROTATE TOWARDS THE DRIVER TO MAKE IT EASY TO READ AND USE 
THE SCREEN IS OUTDATED THE JEEP SYSTEM IS MUCH BETTER LOOKING AND MORE ADVANCED 
THE SCREEN IS PERMANENTLY IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION TIME CONSUMING VOICE RECOGNITION TRAINING 
THE SCREEN IS SMALL I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE OFFERED BIGGER SCREENS ON DIFFERENT MODELS BUT WHEN PAYING $30 000 FOR A CAR I WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE ATLEAST A BIGGER SCREEN AS WELL AS SATELLITE RADIO AS AN OPTION
THE SCREEN IS TOO BRIGHT
THE SCREEN IS TOO BRIGHT WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT
THE SCREEN IS TOO LOW FOR A GLANCE AT WHILE DRIVING 
THE SCREEN IS TOO SMALL COULD BE HI RES FOR BETTER USABILITY 
THE SCREEN IS VERY EASY TO VIEW
THE SCREEN IS VERY INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE
THE SCREEN IS VERY REFLECTIVE WHEN THE SUN HITS IT IT REFLECT LIGHT INTO THE DRIVERS EYES 
THE SCREEN LAYOUT IS NOT THAT ATTRACTIVE BUT THE OVERALL SYSTEM VERY ADVANCED TAKES SOME TIME TO LEARN I NEED A LESSON 
THE SCREEN LAYOUT NEEDS A COMPLETE REDESIGN IT LOOKS DATED AND WASTES A GREAT DEAL OF SCREEN AREA WITH EMPTY SPACES SQUARES AROUND INFORMATION AND NEEDLESS BLANK AREAS 
THE SCREEN LOOKS LIKE IT WAS ADDED TO THE VEHICLE AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT 
THE SCREEN LOOKS REALLY NICE AND THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IS EXTREMELY USEFUL AND CONVENIENT 
THE SCREEN MANIPULATION IS CLUMSY THERE SHOULD BE MORE OPTIONAL VIEWS SCREEN DEFAULTS THE DISCLAIMER SCREEN IS A PAIN IN THE NECK SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISABLE AND SET AN OPTIONAL SCREEN DISPLAY SHOULD NOT REVERT BACK TO THE DISCLAIMER SCREEN E 
THE SCREEN MENU INTERFACE IS NOT GOOD AT ALL NEEDS TO BE MUCH SIMPLER AND REQUIRE LESS FOCUS FROM DRIVER WAY TOO DIFFICULT TO MANAGE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS CHANGING THE RADIO STATION WHILE DRIVING THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ALSO NEED IMPROVEMENT 
THE SCREEN NEEDS TO BE LARGER IT SHOULD HAVE THE EMERGENCY LOCAL WEATHER CHANNEL ANYWHERE IN THE USA LESS SCREEN GLARE EASIER TO READ WITH POLARIZED SUNGLASSES WIFI THE SYSTEM SHOULD UPDATE ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR FREE JUST LIKE MY IPHONE NOT 
THE SCREEN NEEDS TO BE LOCATED HIGHER IN THE CAR AT LEAST ABOVE THE VENTS IF I WERE TO USED THE BUILT IN GPS I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES TOO FAR OFF OF THE ROAD AND WOULD GET INTO AN ACCIDENT MAKES ME FEEL VERY UNSAFE I EVEN WENT AND BOUGHT 
THE SCREEN ON THE SYSTEM SHOULD TURN COMPLETELY OFF WHEN THE SYSTEM IS POWERED OFF
THE SCREEN PROMPT FOR MUSIC SOURCES TO DEFAULT TO ALL 
THE SCREEN RESOLUTION LOOKS REALLY CHEAP AND POOR QUALITY IT ALMOST HAD ME BUYING THE TOYOTA THE TECH IS WAY BEHIND TOYOTA 
THE SCREEN SHOULD BE BIGGER 
THE SCREEN SHOULD BE MADE TO CLOSE TO HIDE IT OR OPEN BY A SWITCH 
THE SCREEN SHOULD BE TOUCH SCREEN THE TRAFFIC SHOULD MIRROR GOGGLE MAPS FOR EASE OF UNDERSTANDING THE RADIO SCREEN HAS A BLUE HIGHLIGHT ON THE STATION PLAYING AND A WHITE BOX MOUSE CURSOR AROUND ANY BOX THAT THE CONTROL KNOB MOVES IT WHEN THE 
THE SCREEN SHOULD HAVE MORE RESOLUTION!
THE SCREEN SHOULD NOT FREEZE AT ANY TIME MORE PHONES NEED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THIS SYSTEM 
THE SCREEN SHOWING THE ARTIST THAT IS SINGING AND THE SONG 
THE SCREEN SHOWING THE NAME OF THE SONG BEING PLAYED AND THE ARTIST SINGING IT 
THE SCREEN SIZE
THE SCREEN SIZE IS NEITHER TOO BIG NOR TOO SMALL PRESSURE REQUIRED TO USE THE TOUCHSCREEN IS JUST RIGHT 
THE SCREEN SIZE IS TOO SMALL THE LETTERS TOO SMALL IN SOME CASE TO READ WITHOUT LEANING FAR FORWARD TO READ 5 AND 6PT TYPE AND THE SCREEN IS BOUNDED BY A PROTRUDING BEZEL THAT MAKES PUSHING COMMANDS ON THE BOTTOM PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT I LOOKED 
THE SCREEN SIZE OF THE NAV
THE SCREEN SIZE SHOULD BE LARGER LIKE 8 ×8 
THE SCREEN SUCKS AND IS HARD TO USE THE IDRIVE IS BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE BUT IT STILL SUCKS 
THE SCREEN TOUCH SOME TIME DOSENT WORK
THE SCREEN WHERE I CAN SELECT FM/AM SATELLITE BLUETOOTH ETC THE MENU IS KIND OF CHALLENGING HAVING TO SCROLL DOWN TO VIEW ALL OF THE CHOICES IT ISN T SUPER RESPONSIVE AND REQUIRES MULTIPLE TAPS SOMETIMES COULD BE BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO WAT 
THE SCREEN WHICH PROJECTS THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA IS A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE I FIND MYSELF NOT TRUSTING IT AND INSTEAD LOOKING BEHIND ME WHEN IN REVERSE 
THE SCREEN WIND DEFLECTOR ON THE CONVERTIBLE IS HARD TO SEE THROUGH THIS SHOULD BE GLASS OR PLEXIGLASS 
THE SCREEN WOULD BE EASIER TO READ IF IT WERE RECESSED TO AVOID DIRECT SUNLIGHT 
THE SCREENS FOLD INTO SEATS AND ARE NOT CUMBERSOME GETTING IN OUT OR RIDING 
THE SCROLL WHEEL TO ENTER INFORMATION INTO THE NAV SYSTEM IS CLUNKY AND SHOULD BE IMPROVED OR ABANDONED IN FAVOR OF TOUCH SCREEN OR SOMETHING ELSE 
THE SCROLLING FEATURE WILL NOT STOP OR TURN OFF
THE SEA OF BUTTONS ON THE CENTER STACK COULD BE CHANGED TO MAKE FINDING WHAT YOU NEED TO PRESS SIMPLER WHILE DRIVING 
THE SEAT ADJUSTMENT DOES NOT GO UP HIGH ENOUGH FOR A PERSON OF MY HEIGHT TO SEE OVER THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR I CANNOT SEE OUT OF THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR WINDOW WHICH IS A RIDICULOUSLY SMALL SIZE ANYWAY AND I CANNOT SEE WELL OVER THE PASSENGER SIDE 
THE SEAT BELT LOCKS ON YOUR LEGS WHEN YOU TURN TO LOOK BEHIND YOU WHEN YOU ARE BACKING UP OR TURNING YOUR BODY TO LOOK BEHIND YOU 
THE SEAT BELTS LOCK TO EASILY AT TIMES ITS HARD TO PULL OVER YOUR SHOULDER TO CLINK IN
THE SEAT BLETS
THE SEAT DOES NOT RISE UP ENOUGH FOR SOMEONE WHO IS SHORT I AM 5 1 AND AT THE HIGHEST POSITION CAN JUST SEE OVER DASH 
THE SEAT HEIGHT HAS TO BE HIGH TO SEE THE FRONT EDGE OF THE CAR IF I ADJUST THAT THEN MY HEAD HITS THE ROOF 
THE SEAT MATERIAL
THE SEAT MAXIMUM HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH FOR ME TO ADEQUATELY SEE OVER THE ENTIRE HOOD AREA 
THE SEAT VIBRATES AS AN ALERT AS WELL AS THE FLASHING RED LIGHTS LEFT SIDE VIBRATES WHEN MOVING OUT OF LANE UNLESS TURN SIGNAL IS ON INDICATING THE ENGINEER S BEHIND THE COLLISION ALERT SYSTEM USED SOME SENSE AND CREATIVITY 
THE SEATBELT CHIME IS EXTREMELY LOUD AND CAN NOT BE TURNED DOWN ANY QUIETER
THE SEATBELT CONNECTION IS RATHER CLOSE TO THE EMERGENCY BRAKE
THE SEATBELT WARNING CANT BE DISABLED 
THE SEATING POSITION IS GREAT FEEL LIKE YOU CAN SEE THE ENTIRE ROAD AHEAD OVER OTHER CARS 
THE SEATS ARE INCREDIBLE!
THE SEATS OF THE THIRD ROW BLOCK THE REAR VIEW MIRROW
THE SECOND ROW PASSENGER SEAT HEAD REST COMPLETELY BLOCKS THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR WINDOW THE FONT ON THE SMALL ODOMETER IS TOO SMALL 
THE SECOND ROW SEATS HEADRESTS BLOCK THE VISION OUT THE BACK WINDOW BECAUSE OF THEIR HEIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BEND THEM DOWN WHEN NO ONE IS IN THE ROW TO HELP SEE WHILE CHANGING LANES 
THE SECONDARY DASH MOUNTED 3D DISPLAY PROVIDES A CONVENIENT MAP DISPLAY LOCATION COMPARED TO THE PYLON MOUNTED SCREEN 
THE SECONDARY PCM DISPLAY IN THE DASHBOARD GAUGES BASED ON THE LENGTH OF MY ROUTE I CAN PUT THE MAP/ROUTE ON THE BIG PCM SCREEN OR ON THE SMALL PCM DISPLAY AND USE THE OTHER DISPLAY FOR ENTERTAINMENT ETC 
THE SELECTOR TONE THE POSITION OF THE STATION SELECTOR BUTTONS IT WAS BETTER WHEN THEY LINED UP WITH THE STATIONS 
THE SENSE OF BLIND SPOTS IS MORE EVIDENT THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED THE REAR WINDOW COULD BE BIGGER TO SEE OUTSIDE BETTER 
THE SENSORS THAT ALERT YOU TO CARS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL AS WELL AS THE PARKING SENSORS OR CARS APPROACHING WHEN YOU ARE BACKING UP THE VEHICLE 
THE SENSUS INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM HAS GREAT POTENTIAL BUT RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT VERSION IS A BIT CLUNKY TO USE MAINLY THE INABILITY TO KEEP A CONTINUOUS INTERNET SIGNAL WHEN USING THE SENSUS APPS 
THE SET UP FOR THE SPEAKERS PAID SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE FOR THE NAV AND SPEAKER SET UP DISAPPOINTED IN THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE BOSE SPEAKERS 
THE SET UP OF THE PHONE CONTACT LIST WAS DIFFICULT FOR ME SO IT D BE NICE TO IMPROVE THAT EXPERIENCE 
THE SETTING OF THE RADIO STATIONS
THE SETTINGS KEEPING THEIR PREFERENCES SET AND NOT RESETTING ITSELF 
THE SFE WASN T AVAILABLE WITH NAVIGATION AND IS NOT A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD HAVE LIKED THE FORD MYTOUCH WITH NAV
THE SHADOWED LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS DO NOT LIGHT UP UP GRADE ROADWAYS MAKES DRIVING AT NIGHT VERY DIFFICULT 
THE SHAKER PRO SYSTEM SOUNDS AWESOME
THE SHAPE OF SIDE MIRRORS RESTRICT THE VISIBILITY
THE SHAPE OF THE BACK WINDOW LIMITS VISIBILITY I KNOW IT IS THE STYLING OF THE VEHICLE THAT DOES THAT SO WE WILL OWN IT 
THE SHAPE OF THE BODY SIDE PANELS MAKE SEEING THE LINES FOR PARKING ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE RESULTING IN ALWAYS PARKING NEAR OR ON THE RIGHT SIDE PARKING LINE NEVER HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH ANY OTHER CAR BUT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE WITH 2010 AND 2015 MA 
THE SHAPE OF THE FRONT HOOD MAKES IT HARD FOR ME TO JUDGES THE DISTANCE TO CURBS OR OTHER OBJECTS 
THE SHAPE OF THE HOOD MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THE FRONT RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE VEHICLE 
THE SHAPE OF THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE BAD THE WHOLE MIRROR SHOULD BE RECTANGLE THE WAY THE OUTSIDE CORNER DROPS DOWN CUTS OFF PART OF THE VIEW THAT IS NEEDED 
THE SHAPE OF THE REAR OF THE CAR LIMIT SIGHT LINES FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT WHEN LOOKING FOR CARS APPROACHING FROM THE REAR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE THERE IS NO WARNING DEVICE ON THIS CAR TO ALERT ME TO PEOPLE IN MY BLIND SPOT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SOMETH 
THE SHAPE OF THE SIDE MIRRORS IS A LITTLE ODD SINCE THE TOP SLOPES DOWN MAKES IT HARD TO SEE FAR WAY TRAFFIC IN THE LEFT LANE WHEN MERGING I MIGHT JUST NEED TO GET USE TO IT 
THE SHAPE OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS MAKES THEM A LITTLE SMALLER THAN I M USED TO AND NOT A BIG
THE SHIFT SWITCH ROEDERER P R N D L
THE SHORT CUTS
THE SHOULDER HARNESS FOR THE MIDDLE POSITION IN THE THIRD ROW SEAT IS A DISTRACTION SINCE IT IS CLEARLY VISIBLE IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THE SIDE AND BACK VISIBILITY OF THE ENCORE IS POOR RELATIVE TO OTHER VEHICLES AND OTHER BUICKS I VE OWNED YES THE BACK UP CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEMS AIM TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DESIGN S BLIND SPOTS BUT I DON T APPRECIATE HAVING TO RELY 
THE SIDE AND REAR WINDOWS ARE SMALL AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES THIS IS PROBABLY MY BIGGEST ISSUE WITH THIS VEHICLE 
THE SIDE BACK REAR WINDOW CAUSES ISSUES HARD TO SEE OUT OF AND JUDGE DISTANCE WHEN TRYING TO LOOK AT AN ANGLE WHILE CROSSING TRAFFIC ON THE CENTER CHANGE LANE 
THE SIDE BARS ON FRONT WINDSHIELD ARE LARGE AND SOMETIMES HARD TO SEE AROUND
THE SIDE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM AND REAR WARNING SYSTEM ARE FANTASTIC !! I HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAVED AT LEAST TWICE FROM LIKELY COLLISIONS WHEN BACKING AND CHANGING LANES 
THE SIDE BLIND SPOTS ARE REALLY BAD 
THE SIDE CAMERA HELPS OUT A LOT IT TAKES CARE OF MY BLIND SIDE
THE SIDE COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURE SHOULD BE MANDATORY FOR THIS VEHICLE 
THE SIDE DOOR MIRRORS SEEM TO BE TOO SMALL THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW POST BLOCKS VISION AT TIMES WHEN GLANCING OVER TO THE LEFT TO CHANGE LANES 
THE SIDE LANE CHANGE CAMERA IS OUTSTANDING AND MOSTLY MAKES UP FOR THE LACK OF DIRECT VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT 
THE SIDE MIRROR AND VERY SMALL WE ADDED A MIRROR INSIDE A MIRROR TO BETTER HELP SEEING SIDE LANES WE DO HAVE THE SMALL LIGHT INDICATION AN APPROACHING VEHICLE HOWEVER THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE LIGHT JUST COME ON WHEN THERE IS NOT APPROACHI 
THE SIDE MIRROR BLIND SPOT IS HUGE DOUBLE MIRROR NEEDS SOME GETTING USE TO A BLIND SPOT SENSOR SHOULD COME STANDARD
THE SIDE MIRROR COULD BE BETTER DESIGNED 
THE SIDE MIRROR HAS LIGHTS ON IT WHEN CHANGING LANES THE LIGHT BLINKS AND SORT OF BLIND THE MIRROR
THE SIDE MIRROR ON DRIVERS SIDE BLOCKS MY VIEW
THE SIDE MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE SEEMS TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SEE CARS IN FRONT AND TO THE SIDE OF ME FOR EXAMPLE AT A FOUR WAY STOP IT S HARD FOR ME TO SEE THE CAR AT THE STOP SIGN TO THE LEFT OF ME NOT SURE IF IT IS BECAUSE I AM 
THE SIDE MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE IS HELPFUL WITHOUT IT I WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING TO CHANGE LANES 
THE SIDE MIRROR WARNING LIGHTS ARE HELPFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES BUT THE VEHICLE HAS SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS 
THE SIDE MIRRORS AND WARNING SYSTEM ARE CRUCIAL AS THERE ARE MANY BLIND SPOTS
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE A BIT SMALL AND TAPERED TOO MUCH IT COULD BE FOR WIND NOISE THEN I M FINE WITH IT 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE A BIT SMALL IN MY OPINION I ADDED SPOT MIRRORS TO HELP WITH BLIND SPOTS BUT I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE A BIT TOO HIGH FOR ME AS I M SHORT AND EVEN WHEN I ADJUST THE SEAT I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING OVER THEM 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE A BIT TOO SMALL 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE A LITTLE SMALL SO IT S HARD TO SEE ANY CARS BUT THERE S ALSO QUITE A FEW BLINDS SPOTS IN THE VEHICLE EVEN WHEN I TURN MY HEAD IT S STILL DIFFICULT TO SEE ALSO THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL ENOUGH AS IS AND IT DOESN T HELP T 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE A LITTLE SMALLER THAN I AM USE TO
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE ALMOST TOO SMALL I VE OWNED THE CAR FOR 3 MONTHS AND I STILL MOVE THE MIRRORS AROUND SOMEWHAT OFTEN TRYING TO FIND THE IDEAL POSITIONING 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE AWKWARD TO LOOK INTO VISIBILITY COULD BE BETTER 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE EXCEPTIONAL FOR SEEING CLEAR DOWN TO THE GROUND!!
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE EXTREMELY SMALL COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE DRIVEN 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE IN YOUR LINE OF SIGHT WHEN YOU ARE PULLING OUT ONTO A ROAD IF YOU ARE A SHORTER PERSON 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE NICE AND BIG BUT CAN I TRUST THEM TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT? THE WARNING LIGHT IN THEM HELPS THIS BUT I M STILL A BIT PHOBIC SO I STILL OFTEN DO A QUICK LOOK BACK BEFORE CHANGING LANES I MAY GO PURCHASE A COUPLE OF THOSE SM 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE POSITIONED TOO HIGH THEY BLOCK MY VISION AS I AM TRYING TO LOOK TO THE SIDE I WORRY ABOUT MY ABILITY TO SEE PEDESTRIANS AND CARS COMING FROM THE SIDE AT INTERSECTIONS 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE QUITE LARGE AND DIFFICULT TO SEE AROUND WHEN DRIVING THEY CREATE BLIND SPOTS WHEN TURNING AND LOOKING LEFT/RIGHT 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL FOR GOOD VISIBILITY 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL NOT ENOUGH SIZE/SURFACE AREA THE SHAPE IS NOT GOOD 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL THE PANELS BETWEEN DOORS CREATES A BLIND SPOT
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE VERY BIG MAKING ME WORRY ABOUT BLIND SPOTS 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE VERY LARGE AND HIGH HARD TO SEE ON A LEFT TURN
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE VERY LARGE AND POSE A PROBLEM WHEN TURNING LEFT DIFFICULT TO SEE PAST THEM THIS IS THE ONLY SERIOUS DESIGN PROBLEM I SEE WITH THE VEHICLE 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE VERY SMALL AND NOT AS USEFUL BECAUSE OF IT I FIND MYSELF TURNING ALL THE TIME TO CHECK THE OTHER LANE WITHOUT EVEN LOOKING AT THE MIRRORS 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE VERY SMALL THEY MAKE IT HARD TO SEE CARS IN OTHER LANES 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE WAY TOO SMALL THE BLIND SPOT IS JUST HUGE WHEN BACKING UP AND I TURN TO LOOK BACK TOWARD THE REAR OF THE PASSENGER SIDE I FIND IT VERY HARD TO REALLY SEE MUCH OUTSIDE THE CAR ON THE OTHER HAND VISIBILITY FORWARD WHILE DRI 
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE WEIRD THEY ARE HARD TO SEE OUT OF AND THE VISORS ARE TOO TINY ACROSS 
THE SIDE MIRRORS BLOCK VISIBILITY WHEN MAKING A TURN ESPECIALLY A LEFT TURN 
THE SIDE MIRRORS COULD BE A BIT BIGGER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY HOWEVER THE WARNING LIGHT IN THE MIRROR DOES ASSIST IN THAT RESPECT 
THE SIDE MIRRORS COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER FOR THE SUV 
THE SIDE MIRRORS COULD BE BETTER 
THE SIDE MIRRORS COULD BE MORE CURVED TO OFFER A WIDER VIEW 
THE SIDE MIRRORS CREATE A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT FOR TRAFFIC
THE SIDE MIRRORS DO CREATE A BLIND SPOT FOR ME THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT AS BRIGHT AS MY HUSBAND S G35
THE SIDE MIRRORS DON T ELECTRONICALLY FOLD IN
THE SIDE MIRRORS HAVE A ENLARGING MIRROR IN THE CORNER WHICH IS HARD TO GET USED TO THAT CORNER LET ME KNOW IF THERE WAS A CAR IN THE BLIND SPOT NOW I HAVE TO REFOCUS TO SEE A LARGER IMAGE NOT WHAT I AM USED TO AND HAS ME VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT 
THE SIDE MIRRORS HAVE A STRANGE INSET DIFFERENT ASPECT MIRROR THAT AFTER 3 MONTHS AND 2500 MILES I AM STILL NOT USED TO I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE NORMAL KIND ALL THE SAME IF TOYOTA WOULD SUPPLY THEM FOR FREE AND RETROFIT FOR FREE THEM I WOULD RUS 
THE SIDE MIRRORS HAVE A VERY BAD BLIND SPOT I REALIZE THAT THIS IS DUE TO THE SHAPE/STYLING AND I HAVE GOTTEN USED TO THEM BUT FOR SOME THIS MAY BE A BIG ISSUE 
THE SIDE MIRRORS LIGHTING TO SHOW SOMETHING IN BLIND SPOTS IS VERY HELPFUL 
THE SIDE MIRRORS NEED THE WARNING DISPLAYS LANE CHANGING CAR IN THE BLIND SPOT
THE SIDE MIRRORS NEED TO BE IMPROVED TO INCREASE VISIBILITY
THE SIDE MIRRORS SEEM A LITTLE SMALL
THE SIDE MIRRORS SEEM SMALL BUT THAT S PROBABLY BECAUSE I HAVEN T GOTTEN A GOOD SENSE OF THE VEHICLE SIZE YET 
THE SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD BE BIGGER BOTH WIDER AND TALLER 
THE SIDE MIRRORS SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE THEY IMPEDE VISIBILITY I ALSO WISH THAT THE REAR WINDOW WAS LARGER LIKE IN PREVIOUS MODELS 
THE SIDE MIRRORS TAKE A WHILE TO GET USED TOO
THE SIDE MIRROW HAS SAVED US FROM A COLLISION
THE SIDE MIRROWS SHOULD BE SOME WHAT SEMI ROUND INSTEAD OF FLAT BING SOME WHAT ROUNDS WILL GIVE ME A BETTER VISIBILITY THE SUN VISORS COULD BE BETTER IF THEY HAD AN EXTENTION COMING FROM THE INSIDE OF THE SUN VISOR
THE SIDE MOUNTED REAR VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE MOUNTED LOWER TO IMPROVE OVER ALL VISIBILITY IN THE FORWARD LEFT AND RIGHT QUADRANTS
THE SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD SUPPORT RAIL CAUSES A MINOR BLIND SPOT 
THE SIDE PANELS OF THE VEHICLE ON THE WINDSHIELD SOMETIMES CAUSES A BLIND SPOT 
THE SIDE PILLARS CAN CAUSE A BLIND SPOT AT STOP SIGNS 
THE SIDE POST CREATE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES LOOKING TO THE LEFT CAN T SEE FRONT END OVER DASH BOARD
THE SIDE POSTS ARE VERY WIDE AND SOMETIMES CREATES A BLIND SPOT WHEN PULLING OUT AT INTERSECTIONS 
THE SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE BETTER DESIGNED
THE SIDE REARVIEW MIRRORS ARE IN ADEQUATE AND DON T PROVIDE A CLEAR VIEW OF ADJACENT LANES REQUIRING THE DRIVE TO LOOK OVER THEIR SHOULDER OR MOVE THEIR HEAD AROUND TO SEE FOR OBSTRUCTIONS
THE SIDE SUPPORT OF THE WINDSHIELD MAKES IT A LITTLE HARD TO SEE LOW WHEN MAKING TURNS
THE SIDE VIEW CAMERA IS A GREAT HELP WHEN TURNING AND PARALLEL PARKING 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR PLACEMENT MAKES IT HARD TO SEE CURBS WHEN MAKING LEFT HAND TURNS 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR SHOULD BE A LITTLE LOWER FOR BETTER VISUAL ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF SHORT DRIVERS
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE A LITTLE ON THE SMALL SIDE 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE A LITTLE SMALL AND CREATE A HUGE BLIND SPOT I GOT SOME OF THOSE MIRROR THINGS THAT YOU ADD TO IT AND THAT HELPED A LOT 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO USE AND SEE OTHER VEHICLES 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE LARGER THAN I WOULD PREFER THEREFORE CREATING A LARGER BLIND SPOT THAT ONE WOULD EXPECT 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE PARTIALLY BLOCKED BECAUSE THE SMALL TRIANGLE WINDOW CAUSED FORD ENGINEERING TO LOCATE THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR IN A POSITION THAT REQUIRES THE DRIVER TO CHANGE HEAD POSITIONS TO GLANCE AT MIRROR AS COMPARED TO JUST A MOVE 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE PERFECT THE POSITIONING AND SIZE OF REARVIEW MIRRORS IS PERFECT 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE RATHER LARGE AND OBSTRUCT THE VIEW OUTWARD VISIBILITY LOOKING BACK IS EXCELLENT BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS EXCELLENT 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE RIGHT IN MY SIGHT LINE WHEN TURNING LEFT IT FEELS DANGEROUS AND I HAVE TO MOVE TO LOOK AROUND THEM 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE SMALL 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE SMALL AND WOULD PROBABLY BENEFIT FROM A CAMERA ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OTHERWISE THE LIGHTS AND GENERAL VISIBILITY IS GREAT!
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE SMALLER AND ITS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER VEHICLES I ENJOY THE DESIGN BETTER AND LIKE THE INTEGRATED TURN SIGNALS 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE SO HIGH UP IT S HARD TO SEE IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY WERE A LITTLE LOWER THE WARNING LIGHTS DO HELP ALOT WHEN SWITCHING LANES 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE SOMEWHAT SMALL AND MAKE IT SLIGHTLY DIFFICULT TO SEE ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDES ADDITIONALLY THE CAR IS SO LIGHT WEIGHT I AM OFTEN FRIGHTENED TO DRIVE IT THROUGH HIGH WINDS AS I FEELS ALMOST TOSS 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE TO SMALL WHY WERE THE MIRROR ON THE ATS COUPE CHANGED IN SIZE FROM THE SEDAN THE SEDAN MIRRORS ARE SO MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL FOR THE CAR 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR ALERT SHOULD BE A BRIGHTER COLOR PERHAPS RED THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR ONLY WORKS AT SPEEDS 40MPH AND ABOVE I D LIKE IT TO WORK AT LOWER SPEEDS 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS DID SEEM A BIT SMALL AT FIRST BUT CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE I THINK THAT THEY ARE APPROPRIATE 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS DONT LET ME SEE GOOD 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ON EACH SIDE WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM A SMALL SPOTTER SPHERICAL AREA IN THE GLASS I HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING THE SWEET SPOT WHERE I CAN SEE DOWN THE ADJACENT LANES AS WELL AS WHEN SOMEONE PULLS INTO THE ALONGSIDE BL 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS SEEM TO BE TOO BIG OR TOO HIGH AND BLOCKS MY VISION WHEN CHANGING LANES OR PARKING
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS TEND TO BLOCK YOUR VIEW WHEN TURNING I AM USSED TO THEM NOW BUT SIT VERY HIGH AND CAN OBSTUCT YOUR VIEW IT WAS VERY NOTICEABLE WHEN I FIRST DROVE THE CAR FOR THE 1ST TIME 
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS WHILE VERY PLEASING AESTHETICALLY ARE A BIT ON THE SMALL SIDE FOR VIEWING 
THE SIDE VISIBILITY IS A BIT LACKING THE LITTLE QUARTER WINDOWS ARE OKAY BUT STILL LEAVE A DECENT BLIND SPOT 
THE SIDE VISIBILITY IS KIND OF BAD DUE TO LARGE AND THICK A PILLAR I MUST PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE PEDESTRIANS ON THE SIDES WHILE I AM MAKING TURNS 
THE SIDE VISIBILITY IS RESTRICTED 
THE SIDE VISIBILITY IS SOMETHING I AM ADJUSTING TO PERHAPS BECAUSE I AM TALL I FIND THE SPACE BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK SEAT OBSTRUCTS MY VIEW WHEN I AM TRYING TO PASS UNLESS I MAKE AN EXTREME TURN OF MY BODY 
THE SIDE VISIBILITY IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE DOWN TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT TURNING TO SHARP TO HIT A CURB 
THE SIDE VISIBILITY ISN T AS CLEAR AS MY LAST VEHICLE THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE OF A BLIND SPOT AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD 
THE SIDE VISIBILTY OF FROM THE DRIVER SEAT IS NOT VERY GOOD IT IS VERY EASY TO HAVE A CAR IN YOUR BLIND SPOT AND THE BLIND SPOT SEEMS VERY LARGE 
THE SIDE WARNING SYSTEM IS NOT VERY GOOD CHECK OUT HOW MERCEDES DOES IT WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE YELLOW AND RED ARROWS IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THE BMW SYSTEM IS GENERALLY NEVER SEEN 
THE SIDE WARNINGS ARE EXCELLENT MAKE CHANGING LANES A BREEZE 
THE SIDE WARNINGS ARE VERY HELPFUL
THE SIDE WINDOWS GET SO FILTHY FROM DIRT AND SALT THAT IT GETS HARD TO SEE OUT OF THEM AND THERE ISN T ANY WAY TO CLEAN THEM WHILE DRIVING THIS HAPPENS DURING FREEWAY DRIVING NOT JUST OFF ROAD I LL BE GETTING MUD FLAPS FOR MY WRANGLER 
THE SIDE WINDOWS OF THE BACK SEAT ARE TOO SMALL TO BE OF MUCH USE BUT THAT S OK BECAUSE I KNEW THAT WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS HELP TREMENDOUSLY MY FAVORITE FEATURE THOUGH IS THE REAR VIEW CAMERA! I WONDER HOW I GOT ALONG 
THE SIDEBAR BETWEEN THE FRONT & BACK SEATS AND THE FRONT SEAT HEADREST BLOCK A FAIR AMOUNT OF VISIBILITY ON THE RIGHT SIDE WHEN PULLING OUT OF AN INTERSECTION 
THE SIDES OF THE HOOD COME UP AND IT S HARD TO JUDGE WHERE YOUR FENDER ENDS OR SEE CURBS WHEN YOU ARE TURNING RIGHT 
THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS ARE JUST OK AND I CAN T EXPLAIN EXACTLY WHY MAYBE THE VIEWING ANGLE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE IS TOO CLOSE THE FIELD OF VIEW IS TOO NARROW 
THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS ARE QUITE SMALL BUT STILL USABLE WHILE THE A AND B PILLARS ARE SMALLER THAN COMPETITORS C PILLARS ARE STILL LARGE THE SUN VISORS ARE CLEVER BUT TOO SMALL ON LONGER TRIPS THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS AREN T PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE 
THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO LARGE AND BLOCK VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING LEFT SAME CAN BE SAID OF THE SIDE CORNERS FROM ROOF TO DOOR 
THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO LESSEN THE BLIND SPOTS I FEAR I MAY HIT INTO SOMEONE ON THE HIGHWAY THE HOOD SEEMS TO BE TOO HIGH AND LONG AND MAKES IT HARD TO TELL IF I M ALL THE WAY IN A SPACE OR STICKING OUT TOO MUCH 
THE SILVER TRIM AROUND THE VENT NEXT TO THE STEERING WHEEL REFLECTS IN THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW ALSO IT SHOULD BE AN OPTION WHETHER YOU WANT THE DIMMED REAR VIEW MIRROR AT NIGHT 
THE SINGLE CD PLAYER ASPECT COULD BE BETTER LIKE HAVING MULTIPLE CD S THAT COULD BE SWITCHED OUT EASILY 
THE SINGLE ONLY PROBLEM WE VE EXPERIENCED WITH SRX BODY STYLE HAD A 2012 SRX ALSO IS THE POOR VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOWS AND PARTICULARLY THE SIDE WINDOWS HAVING PASSING ALERT SYSTEM IS A GREAT HELP AND A MUCH BIGGER REAR CAMERA SCREEN 
THE SIRIUS XM SATELLITE RADIO SEEMS TO TAKE LONGER THAN NORMAL TO ACQUIRE A SIGNAL 
THE SIRIUSXM SYSTEM
THE SIRIUSXM WEATHER FEATURE IS REALLY A NICE TOUCH I LOVE HOW IT INTEGRATES INTO THE MAP I ALSO REALLY LOVE BEING ABLE TO SEND AN ADDRESS TO THE CAR IT WOULD BE NICE TO MAKE MORE APPS AVAILABLE FOR THE SCREEN BUT THE WHOLE MYLINK SYSTEM IS GR 
THE SIRUS SATTELITE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED IT LOOSES SIGNAL TO THE MOST MINIMAL INTERFERENCE
THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE WINDOW ALONG WITH THE POSITIONING OF THE SEAT GIVES A FEELING OF EXCELLENT VISIBILITY 
THE SIZE COULD A MORE SPACING 
THE SIZE IS GREAT THE MOTOR IS FANTASTIC THE SUSPENSION IS EXCELLENT THE SOUND OF THE CAR IS EXCEPTIONAL IT IS A SOLID CAR BUT IT IS ALSO WONDERFUL SIMPLE YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF THE CAR AND IT IS JUST UNBELIEVABLY FUN TO DRIVE
THE SIZE OF BLIND SPOTS IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING HOWEVER THE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO MOST OF THE BLIND SPOT ISSUES IS SURELY A COMPROMISE FOR THE OVERALL RIGIDITY OF THE CHASSIS 
THE SIZE OF MY CAR AND THE WRAP AROUND WINDOWS ENABLES ME TO FEEL CONFIDENT WHEN PASSING BACKING OR GETTING OFF AND ON THE INTERSTATE 
THE SIZE OF THE FRONT WINDOW POSTS COMBINED WITH THE SIZE OF THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE ABSOLUTE SAFETY ISSUES HUGE FORWARD BLIND SPOTS WHEN TURNING AT NIGHT THAT PROBLEM PLUS NO SIDE LIGHTING IS A REAL PROBLEM 
THE SIZE OF THE GAS TANK 
THE SIZE OF THE POSTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD HAS CAUSED A SCARE TWICE WHERE SOMEONE WAS IN MY BLIND SPOT AND COMPLETELY HIDDEN WHEN I LOOKED AT A STOP ONLY TO SEE THEM AS I PULLED FORWARD 
THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN AND THE VOICE CONTROL ACTUALLY WORKS WHEN JUST SAYING A COMMAND ONCE 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES 
THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN IS VERY EASY TO SEE AND USE WHILE DRIVING COMPARED TO OLDER MODELS THAT COULD BARELY BE SEEN OR OTHER MANUFACTURERS
THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE MAKES FOR EASIER PARKING AND SEEING OTHER VEHICLES I FEEL MUCH SAFER THAT MY SILVERADO I DROVE BEFORE 
THE SIZE SHAPE AND ANGLE OF MIRRORS GIVES EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY TRACTION IN SLIPPERY WEATHER IS AMAZING BEST CAR I VE EVER OWNED!
THE SIZE/PLACEMENT OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS CAN SOMETIMES OBSCURE VISIBILITY
THE SKIP TO NEXT PRESET ON STEERING WHEEL SHOULD ONLY NEED TO BE BUT ONCE 
THE SLANT OF THE WINDSHIELD PUTS THE ROOF LINE INN YOUR EYE SIGHT MAKING THE VISIBLE AREA YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FRONT SMALL ALSO THE A PILLAR IS SO WIDE YOU HAVE A MAJOR BLIND SPOT
THE SLIDE CONTROL FOR RADIO STATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO USE
THE SLIDING DOOR SUN VISORS ARE GREAT AND A REALLY NICE ADDED FEATURE!
THE SLIGHTLY LOWER REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT IS BASED ON NOT USING THE ELECTRONIC AIDS REAR CAMERA AND LANE CHANGE ASSIST SINCE I M STILL NOT QUITE USED TO USING THEM THE LANE CHANGE ASSIST WORKS VERY WELL AS THE SIDE MIRRORS ALONE AR 
THE SLOPED REAREND DOES LIMIT VISIBLITY TO THE REAR
THE SMALL GREENHOUSE AND LARGE PILLARS MAKES OUTWARD VISIBILITY LESS THAN IDEAL 
THE SMALL INSERT IN THE DRIVERS MIRROR COULD BE A BIT LARGER I HAD LARGER CURVED MIRRORS ON MY FORD TRUCK AND FELT IT GAVE ME BETTER VIEW ON EACH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE MOST IMPORTANT ON DRIVERS SIDE AS THE RH MIRROR DOES A GOOD JOB 
THE SMALL MIRROR INSIDE SIDE MIRROR REMOVES BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES LOVE IT!
THE SMALL REAR WINDOW DOES LIMIT THE VIEW OUT BACK
THE SMALL REAR WINDOW IN THE CONVERTIBLE TOP SOMETIMES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE 
THE SMALL REAR WINDOWS CAUSE BLIND SPOTS 
THE SMALL SIDE BACK WINDOWS ARE WORTHLESS 
THE SMALL SUN VISORS ARE REALLY USELESS
THE SMALL WIDE ANGLE PORTION ON DRIVER SIDE MIRROR IS ALMOST USELESS SEEMS A POORLY EXECUTED AFTER THOUGHT 
THE SMALL WINDOW DEFINITELY HELPS TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES WHEN DRIVING BUT THERE A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE THAT PERHAPS A BETTER MIRROR COULD ALLEVIATE 
THE SMALL WINDOWS IN FRONT OF THE FRONT DOORS ADD TO THE VISUAL APPEAL OF THE VEHICLE FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT DO LITTLE TO IMPROVE VISIBILITY FROM THE INSIDE OF THE OUTSIDE ! THE A PILLARS ARE A LITTLE TOO THICK AND THIS AFFECTS MY VISIBILITY WHEN 
THE SMALL WINDOWS IN THE CORNERS OF THE FRONT DOORS I AM NOT SURE WHETHER I WOULD CALL IT BAD BUT IT IS UNUSUAL AND HAS TAKEN SOME GETTING USED TO 
THE SMALL WINDOWS IN THE DRIVERS SIDE DASH KEEPING YOU FROM LOOKING AWAY TO THE CENTER DISPLAY 
THE SMALL WINDOWS ON THE FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDES REALLY INCREASE VISIBILITY 
THE SMALLER REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE A BIG MISTAKE!!!
THE SMOOTH RIDE LOOK SAFETY
THE SNYC SYSTEM HAS IMPROVED TREMENDOUSLY IT HAS BECOME MY GO TO PREFERENCE IN CONTROLLING THESE SYSTEMS AS AN ADDED BONUS THE ADDITIONAL BUTTONS PROVIDE EASE OF MIND SHOULD I NEED THEM 
THE SNYC SYSTEM NEED AN UPGRADE
THE SOFT TOP
THE SOFTWARE IS UNACCEPTABLE IT S HARD TO USE AND VERY SLOW IT S ALSO QUITE UGLY 
THE SOFTWARE NEEDS AN OVERHAUL THE TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS TO BE UPDATED 
THE SOFTWARE SEEMS SLOW WHEN LOADING THE INTERFACE IS THE OLDER SOFTWARE VERSION COMPARED TO THE MAZDA3 2015 MODEL 
THE SOFTWARE THAT CONTROLS THE HOME SCREEN WHEN FLIPPING BACK AND FORTH FROM VARIOUS APPLICATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO SET THIS WAS TRUE ON MY LAST TERRAIN WITH THE NAV SYSTEM I DON T HAVE THAT PROBLEM ON THE NEW CAR SINCE I ELECTED TO USE MY GAR 
THE SOLID SLANTING BAR AT THE LEFT OF THE WINDSHIELD SOMETIMES OBSCURES VISION WHEN TURNING LEFT 
THE SOLID SPACE BETWEEN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND PASSENGER FRONT WINDOWS IS SLIGHTLY WIDER THAN IN MY 04 GOLF DECREASING DRIVER S VISIBILITY SLIGHTLY 
THE SOMEWHAT REFLECTIVE SURFACE OF THE FINISH ADJACENT TO THE BACK SIDE WINDOW SOMETIMES RESEMBLES A CAR IN THE BLIND SPOT AT FIRST GLANCE 
THE SONG AND ARTIST OF CD IS DISPLAYED
THE SOUD SYSTEM ISNT LOUD ENOGH

THE SOUND SYSTEM WHILE SUPPOSEDLY BEING A PREMIUM SYSTEM DOES NOT DELIVER THE QUALITY OF SOUND I EXPECT FROM A PREMIUM CAR
THE SOUND SYSTEM WORKS GREAT TOGETHER INTEGRATING SEVERAL MEDIA SOURCES AND HAS A GREAT SOUND 
THE SOUND SYSTEM/SPEAKERS ARE AVERAGE 
THE SOUND SYSTEMS IS THE BEST FACTORY SYSTEM I HAVE EVER USED 
THE SOUND THAT COMES OUT OF THOSE SPEAKERS IS AWESOME 
THE SOUND THAT COMES THROUGH THE SPEAKS FROM SIRIUS XM RADIO IS GREAT I HAVE USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SEVERAL TIMES AND REALLY LIKE IT BIG SELLING POINT FOR ME AS COMPARED TO BUYING A PRE CERTIFIED THAT DIDN T HAVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
THE SOUND THROUGH THE SPEAKERS ISN T WELL BALANCED CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE THE VOLUME NEEDS TO BE LOWER IN THE FRONT IN ORDER TO HEAR IT WELL ENOUGH IN THE BACK 
THE SOUND VOLUME OF THE PHONE IS TERRIBLE THE APPS ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH A WINDOWS PHONE HOWEVER THEY DIDN T MENTION THAT BEFORE THE SALE SO I CAN T USE THE IN CAR APPS THE MOUSE FUNCTION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE AND NOT USER FRIENDLY 
THE SOUND WHEN I PUT MY MUSIC ON BLUETOOTH DOES NOT SOUND AS LOUD AS THE RADIO

THE SOUNDS IS AMAZING
THE SOUNDS IS EXCEPTIONAL AND IT UNDERSTANDS ME VERY WELL DURING VOICE COMMANDS 
THE SOUNDS IS FANTASTIC 
THE SOUNDS IS MY FAVORITE HAS A VERY UNDERSTANDABLE VOICE
THE SOUNDS QUALITY FROM THE FACTORY SPEAKERS CAN BE DISAPPOINTING ONLY HAVE A TREBLE AND BASS ADJUSTMENT LIMITS THINGS ADDING A MIDRANGE ADJUSTMENT AT LEAST WOULD HELP 
THE SOUNDS SYSTEM IS NOT TOP NOTCH FOR A CAR LIKE THIS AND FOR THE PRICE OF THE CAR I EXPECT BETTER SOUND SYSTEM IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE SCREEN FOR THE CONTROLS WAS LARGER
THE SOURCE BUTTON IS TOO CLOSE OR INCONVENIENT AND I INADVERTENTLY CHANGE SOURCES WHILE DRIVING AND DOING OTHER THINGS 
THE SPACE BETWEEN THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDSHIELD AND THE DRIVER S DOOR IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT 
THE SPARE TIRE AND REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS PROVIDE BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING
THE SPARE TIRE MOUNTED TO THE REAR MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE DIRECTLY OUT THE BACK 
THE SPARK EV IS VERY EASY TO GET IN & OUT OF & IS TALL ENOUGH THAT I CAN SEE FAR AROUND ME IN EVERY DIRECTION THE WINDOWS GIVE GREAT VISIBILITY & CAUSE VERY LITTLE BLIND SPOTS IF ANY IT COULD USE A BACKUP CAMERA IF ONLY TO HAVE TECH SPECS TO COM 
THE SPEACKERS ARE VERY GOOD
THE SPEAKER ARE GREAT
THE SPEAKER COULD BE PLACED ON THE STEERING WHEEL OR DASH RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER WHEN HANDS FREE OFTEN I HAVE TO PRACTICALLY YELL TO BE HEARD WELL BY THE PERSON I AM CALLING 
THE SPEAKER DO NOT SOUND VERY GOOD THE SOUND MUFFLED I THINK THEY SHOULD GET LOUDER 
THE SPEAKER DOESN T PICK UP MY VOICE VERY WELL MY HUSBAND AND PARENTS HAVE PROBLEMS HEARING ME 
THE SPEAKER FOR PHONE CALLS IS ONLY ON THE DRIVERS SIDE ON THE ROOF SO PASSENGERS CAN T BE HEARD BY CALLERS 
THE SPEAKER FOR THE BLUE TOOTH IS VERY CLEAR 
THE SPEAKER FOR THE BLUETOOTH NEEDS TO BE BIGGER THE 2 SMALL HOLES ARE NOT BIG ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE HAVING A PROBLEM HEARING ME WHEN I AM TALKING WITH THEM
THE SPEAKER FOR THE HANDS FREE CALLING IT COULD BE MORE SENSITIVE I HAVE TO SPEAK RATHER LOUD FOR SOMEONE TO HEAR ME 
THE SPEAKER IS VERY WEAK WHEN IT IS READING TEXT MESSAGES HIGHER QUALITY SPEAKER SYSTEM WOULD BE GREAT 
THE SPEAKER PHONE IS REALLY CLEAR MY 2013 TAHOE HAD A LOT OF BACKGROUND NOISE AND I ALWAYS HAD TO TAKE MY CALLS ON MY CELL PHONE I ALSO LIKE HAVING KNOBS FOR THE RADIO MY HUSBAND S CADILLAC HAS PRESSURE POINTS AND I HAVE TROUBLE FINDING THEM 
THE SPEAKER QUALITY AND OVERALL POWER OF THE SYSTEM 
THE SPEAKER QUALITY COULD BE BETTER FROM THE FACTORY THE SATELLITE RADIO QUALITY IS TERRIBLE ALL OTHER FUNCTIONS SOUND OK 
THE SPEAKER QUALITY IS AMAZING!
THE SPEAKER QUALITY IS GOOD THAT IS ALL I REQUIRE
THE SPEAKER QUALITY IS SUPERB 
THE SPEAKER QUALITY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT 
THE SPEAKER QUALITY NEEDS TO UPGRADE
THE SPEAKER QUALITY THE SOUND MOSTLY COMES FROM THE FRONT AND PEOPLE IN THE BACKSEAT CANT HEAR IT WELL YOU HAVE TO HIGHER IT ALOT 
THE SPEAKER SOUND COULD BE A BIT BETTER THE SOUND LEVEL HAS TO BE TURNED UP FAIRLY LOUD BEFORE THE SOUND BECOMES INTEGRATED WITH THE CAR AT LOWER SOUND LEVELS THE DRIVER CAN DEFINITELY TELL FROM WHICH SPEAKER THE SOUND ORIGINATED AND THE SOU 
THE SPEAKER SOUND IS LESS THAN I EXPECTED I THINK THE VOLUME AND QUALITY IS A LITTLE LESS 
THE SPEAKER SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT GIVEN I DON T LIKE LOUD MUSIC I CAN HAVE IT AT 3 WITH EVERYONE IN THE CAR BEING HAPPY 
THE SPEAKER SOUND QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY OLD 2005 LEXUS ES330 
THE SPEAKER SYSTEM 
THE SPEAKER SYSTEM COULD BE A BIT BETTER 
THE SPEAKER SYSTEM IS A LITTLE WEAK 
THE SPEAKER SYSTEM IS JUST FABULOUS 
THE SPEAKER SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING MAKING LISTENING TO MUSIC A REAL PLEASURE ON LONG TRIPS 
THE SPEAKER SYSTEM IS THE ASPECT THAT COULD USE THE MOST IMPROVEMENT THE CLEARNESS OF THE SPEAKERS COULD USE IMPROVEMENT 
THE SPEAKER SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT 
THE SPEAKER SYSTEM WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST I TWEAKED IT 100 DIFFERENT WAYS AND GOT 100 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF BAD I GAVE UP AND HAD AN AFTERMARKET SYSTEM INSTALLED NOW IT IS GREAT AND THE COST OF THE AFTERMARK SYSTEM ALPINE SPEAKERS PIONEER 
THE SPEAKER VOLUME IS TOO LOW 
THE SPEAKER VOLUME SEEMS TO VARY WHILE DRIVING MOST NOTICEABLE WITH A CD PLAYING I MAY HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SHUT OFF THE VEHICLE SPEED THING SVC? ITS TECH OVERKILL JUST NOTICED THE PROBLEM 
THE SPEAKERS
THE SPEAKERS AND SOUND SYSTEM QUALITY IS EXCEPTIONAL COMBINED WITH THE VERY QUIET INTERIOR MAKES FOR THE MOST ENJOYABLE LISTENING I HAVE EXPERIENCED 
THE SPEAKERS ARE A HUGE UPGRADE FROM THE 2011 SUBARU IMPREZA OUTBACK SPORT THAT I PREVIOUSLY HAD HOWEVER I BELIEVE THE SPEAKERS COULD STILL BE BETTER THE ONLY OTHER COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT I CAN T NAVIGATE SATELLITE RADIO STATIONS USING THE S 
THE SPEAKERS ARE A JOKE WE HAVE BOSE SPEAKERS AND THEY AREN T ANY BETTER 
THE SPEAKERS ARE A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING IN A VEHICLE THAT COSTS 60K+ 
THE SPEAKERS ARE ACCEPTABLE AND VERY GOOD
THE SPEAKERS ARE AMAZING AND PRODUCE GREAT SOUND 
THE SPEAKERS ARE AMAZING FOR LISTENING TO MUSIC AND DULLS VS GOES COMPLETELY SILENT WHENEVER THE NAVIGATION STARTS SPEAKING 
THE SPEAKERS ARE AMAZING!
THE SPEAKERS ARE AWESOME!
THE SPEAKERS ARE AWFUL AND THE STREAMING OF MUSIC FROM MY CELL PHONE THROUGH THE CARS SPEAKERS IS AWFUL THE SPEAKERS ARE OKAY WITH RADIO AND CD ALMOST ACCEPTABLE BUT STEAMING MUSIC FROM MY CELL PHONE IS AWFUL AND I HATE IT MY HUSBAND HAS REF 
THE SPEAKERS ARE CLEAR AND SOUND REALLY GOOD 
THE SPEAKERS ARE GREAT AND I HAVEN T HAD TO EVEN ONCE CHANGE AUDIO CONTROLS THE SYSTEM SEEMS INTUITIVE 
THE SPEAKERS ARE GREAT I CAN HAER PHONE CALLS WELL BUT THE MIC FOR MY VOICE ISN T THAT GREAT ALONG WITH THE ROAD NOISE MAKE IT HARD FOR THE PERSON I AM TALKING TO TO HEAR ME
THE SPEAKERS ARE HORRIBLE SOUNDS QUALITY IS BELOW AVERAGE 
THE SPEAKERS ARE HORRIBLE THERE IS SETTING TO HAVE BETTER BASS AND ADJUST IT HOW YOU LIKE BUT EVEN WITH IT ADJUSTED THEY SOUND BAD 
THE SPEAKERS ARE JUST FAIR 
THE SPEAKERS ARE LACKLUSTER FOR THEIR ADVERTISEMENT AS ALL BEATS BRAND SPEAKERS ARE I HAD A BETTER AUDIO RESPONSE CURVE AND BETTER BASE IN MY OLD CAR S FACTORY 500W STEREO SYSTEM THAN DODGE S 558W BEATS SYSTEM 
THE SPEAKERS ARE LOW QUALITY AND HISS/CRACKLE WHEN VOLUME IS ONLY TURNED UP 1/2 WAY
THE SPEAKERS ARE NOT AS LOUD AS EXPECTED 
THE SPEAKERS ARE NOT GREAT 
THE SPEAKERS ARE NOT GREAT THE DISPLAY IS RED ON BLACK I HAVE TO ADJUST THE BRIGHTNESS MANUALLY WHICH IS TIED TO THE DASHBOARD SO THE WHITE SPEEDOMETER LIGHTS ARE VERY BRIGHT BECAUSE I LIVE IN AZ WHERE IT IS EXCEPTIONALLY SUNNY APPROX 350 DAYS 
THE SPEAKERS ARE NOT LOUD ENOUGH 
THE SPEAKERS ARE NOT OF GOOD QUALITY
THE SPEAKERS ARE NOT VERY GOOD 
THE SPEAKERS ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL 
THE SPEAKERS ARE NOT VERY GOOD SEEMS WHEN LISTENING TO THE RADIO IT HAS TO BE TURNED UP MORE THAN IT SHOULD BE 
THE SPEAKERS ARE OF LOW QUALITY TO ME AND I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT BLOW THEM BY SIMPLY TURNING UP THE VOLUME
THE SPEAKERS ARE OKAY NOT WHAT I D EXPECT FROM A HIGH END CAR ALSO WHY ARE THERE NO EQUALIZER ADJUSTMENTS ON THE VEHICLE? THE SUBWOOFER IS ALSO VERY OVERPOWERING 
THE SPEAKERS ARE PATHETIC FOR A FLAGSHIP LUXURY SUV THIS THING STICKERED FOR AROUND 65K AND THE FACTORY SOUND SYSTEM IN MY F150 IS BETTER 
THE SPEAKERS ARE PRETTY QUIET PHONE CALLS ARE FINE BUT THE RADIO SEEMS MUFFLED 
THE SPEAKERS ARE PRETTY UNINSPIRING AND THE VEHICLE LACKS A FULL SOUND 
THE SPEAKERS ARE TERRIBLE EACH SOURCE SOUNDS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THROUGH THE HEAD UNIT SO EQUALIZER HAS TO BE RESET WHEN SELECTING 
THE SPEAKERS ARE TERRIBLE VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY 
THE SPEAKERS ARE TERRIFIC
THE SPEAKERS ARE THE BEST I VE HEARD IN A VEHICLE MY LAST SUV WAS A 2008 PORSCHE CAYENNE S AND I WOULD SAY THAT THESE ARE BETTER THAN THE BOSE SYSTEM IN THERE THE QUALITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE SOUND IS LIKE YOU RE SITTING IN CONCERT OR AT A SY 
THE SPEAKERS ARE THE BEST! I LOVE IT !
THE SPEAKERS ARE TOO FATIGUING ON THE HIGHS AND THE BASS IS HORRIBLE I HAVE TO TURN DOWN THE BASS AND THE TREBLE JUST TO LISTEN TO IT BELOW AVERAGE SOUND FROM A BRAND NAME BOSE 
THE SPEAKERS ARE VERY GOOD 
THE SPEAKERS ARE VERY POOR
THE SPEAKERS ARE VERY POOR QUALITY FOR THIS HIGH END OF A CAR I HAVE TO TURN THE VOLUME ALMOST ALL THE WAY UP JUST HEAR MUSIC AND PEOPLE ON THE PHONE 
THE SPEAKERS ARE VERY VERY CHEAP
THE SPEAKERS ARE VERY WEAK BUT THAT S THE ONLY THING I WOULD CHANGE 
THE SPEAKERS ARE WONDERFUL
THE SPEAKERS AREN T THE GREATEST 
THE SPEAKERS AREN T VERY GOOD AND THE SCREEN IS HARD TO CHANGE WHEN DRIVING 
THE SPEAKERS ARENT LOUD AT ALL IT ONLY GOES UP TO 40 IN VOLUME I THINK THAT CAN BE IMPROVED 
THE SPEAKERS BASS COULD BE BETTER 
THE SPEAKERS BOSE AND SOUND ARE SO ENJOYABLE BEST I HAVE HAD IN ALL MY CARS I HAVE NOT USED MY CAR MUCH SINCE PURCHASE BECAUSE OF MEDICAL ISSUES BUT BOUGHT IT TO DO MUCH TRAVELING THIS SUMMER AND WILL BE USING ALL OF THE GOOD FEATURE 
THE SPEAKERS BUZZ AS IF THE BASS IS UP TO HIGH! I HATE IT! SOUNDS LIKE SOME THING IS SITTING ON THE SPEAKER INSIDE THE DASHBOARD 
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE A BETTER QUALITY IN ORDER TO HANDLE A HIGHER MAXIMUM VOLUME
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE A BIT BETTER FOR MUSIC AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY TEDIOUS FOR ENTERING DESTINATION INFO 
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER 
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER QUULITY
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER ALSO THE BLUE TOOTH CONNECTION SHOULD BE FASTER I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE INTERNET 
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER SO THE SOUND IS MORE CLEAR THE SILVER DIAL CONTROLS SUCK IT S LIKE FROM THE 1950 S AND IT FEELS HORRIBLE ON MY FINGERS LIKE CACTUS
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE CLEARER AND LOUDER 
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE LOUDER 
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE MORE BANGARANG WITH A BIT MORE UMPH 
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE OF BETTER QUALITY TO GIVE BETTER SOUND EFFECTIVENESS
THE SPEAKERS COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENT
THE SPEAKERS DO NO DELIVER QUALITY SOUND
THE SPEAKERS DO NOT SOUND GOOD AT A LOUD LEVEL YOU HAVE TO TURN IT UP ALMOST ALL THE WAY AND IT STILL ISN T THAT LOUD 
THE SPEAKERS DO NOT SOUND LIKE THEY ARE SURROUND
THE SPEAKERS DON T ALLOW FOR SOME PARTS OF SONGS TO BE HEARD I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE ISSUE IS ALSO THE SPEAKERS VOLUME IS NOT IMPRESSIVE 
THE SPEAKERS DON T SOUND AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED THE NAVIGATION IS SLOW WHEN TYPING 
THE SPEAKERS DONT SOUND GOOD WHEN OVER 20 AND THE USB DEVISE DOESNT WORK WITH MY PHONE
THE SPEAKERS FOR THE RADIO ARE TERRIBLE I REALLY HAVE TO TURN IT UP TO HEAR OVER THE WIND NOISE EVEN WHEN THE HARD TOP IS ON 
THE SPEAKERS GIVE A CLEAR SOUND REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE I E PHONE SATELLITE W RADIO OR AM/FM 
THE SPEAKERS HAVE A GREAT SOUND
THE SPEAKERS HAVE ALWAYS POPPED EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT BLOWN
THE SPEAKERS HAVE TOO MUCH MID IN THEM I THOUGHT THE BOSTON SPEAKERS WERE STOCK WHEN I UPGRADED TO THE NEXT HIGHER END JEEP I WILL KNOW BETTER NEXT TIME 
THE SPEAKERS HAVE VERY GOOD SOUND QUALITY 
THE SPEAKERS HAVE VERY LITTLE BASS I M 49 YEARS OLD I DON T LIKE BASS HEAVY MUSIC BUT THE STEREO COULD USE MORE BASS THE EQ HAS TO HAVE THE BASS ALL THE WAY UP JUST TO SOUND NORMAL I KNOW BASS TAKES MORE POWER BUT THAT S CONSERVING TO MUCH 
THE SPEAKERS IN MY CAR ARE PHENOMENAL!
THE SPEAKERS IN MY TOYOTA COROLLA HAD BETTER SOUND QUALITY 
THE SPEAKERS IN THE VEHICLE ARE OUTSTANDING 
THE SPEAKERS IN THIS CAR ARE REALLY LACKLUSTRE AND THE AUDIO TUNES IN AND OUT TO HD I TRULY HAVEN T USED THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AS I DO NOT OWN A CELL PHONE I DON T THINK ADDING A COUPLE OF HUNDRED DOLLARS TO MAKE THE CAR S AUDIO SOUND BETT 
THE SPEAKERS NEED BE A BETTER QUALITY FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM CD/RADIO
THE SPEAKERS NEED MORE BASS
THE SPEAKERS NEED TO BE LOUDER ONLY HAVE FRONT SPEAKERS AND THE PLACEMENT IS TERRIBLE 
THE SPEAKERS NEED TO GIVE A CRISPER SOUND
THE SPEAKERS NOT TO BAD AUDIO FROM FRONT SPEAKERS BUT THE REAR SPEAKER DON T HAVE NO VOLUME
THE SPEAKERS OF MY CAR COULD HAVE A LITTLE BETTER 
THE SPEAKERS OF THE CAR SOUND GOOD I DON T HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN MY CAR BUT THAT WOULD BE AMAZING AND REALLY COME IN HANDY 
THE SPEAKERS ONLY SOUND CLEAN AND NICE AT HIGH VOLUMES I DON T WANT TO BLARE MY MUSIC TO ENJOY IT I LOVE AMBIENT MUSIC ALL THE TIME IT S NOT SPECIAL AT ALL IN THE CAR NO ONE EVER COMMENTS ON IT AND THEY SHOULD BECAUSE IT S NEW TECHNOLOGY A 
THE SPEAKERS REALLY COULD BE UPGRADED I WOULD PAY TO HAVE AN OPTION TO UPGRADE THE SOUND SYSTEM THE EXISTING SYSTEM IS TINNY 
THE SPEAKERS SEEMED TO BE MUFFLED THE RADIO VOLUME MUST BE TURNED UP TO A HIGH NUMBER TO BE ABLE TO HEAR CLEARLY MUSIC/TALK RADIO CONVERSATION 
THE SPEAKERS SHOULD BE MORE POWERFUL FOR A CONVERTIBLE 
THE SPEAKERS SHOULD BE UPGRADED 
THE SPEAKERS SHOULD NOT BUZZ WHILE PLAYING MUSIC
THE SPEAKERS SOMETIMES SOUND MUFFLED AND I HAVE TO TURN UP THE VOLUME TO HEAR BETTER 
THE SPEAKERS SOUND A BIT TINNY WHEN THE WINDOWS ARE ROLLED DOWN AND SOME OF THE STEREO FUNCTIONS SUCH AS FADE ARE DIFFICULT TO FIND 
THE SPEAKERS SOUND AMAZING AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS GREAT THE TRAFFIC IS GREAT AND UP TO DATE 
THE SPEAKERS SOUND AMAZING I PUMP MY MUSIC ALL DAY LONG!
THE SPEAKERS SOUND CHEAP POOR AUDIO QUALITY ON FM AND SATELLITE 
THE SPEAKERS SOUND FAR AND LOW SOMETIMES WHEN I USE THE IPOD IT SOUNDS LIKE THE DRIVER SPEAKER GOES OUT
THE SPEAKERS SOUND GREAT AND ONE THING I MADE SURE THAT THE CAR HAD A USB CONNECTION FOR MY DEVICES MAKING A PHONE CALL IS SO EASY AND I LOVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO MAKE THE CALLS I GIVE THE NAME ONE TIME AND THE CALL IS CONNECTED I JUST LOVE 
THE SPEAKERS SOUND QUALITY IS POOR
THE SPEAKERS SOUND REALLY GOOD AND THE QUALITY OF THE BASS IS NICE 
THE SPEAKERS SOUND REALLY NICE
THE SPEAKERS SOUND TERRIBLE 
THE SPEAKERS SOUND TERRIBLE IT WOULD HELP TO POSITION THE TWEETERS MUCH LIKE THE POSITION OF THE 2012 HONDA CIVIC SOUND BOUNCING OFF OF A WINDSHIELD AND THEN TO THE LISTENER LOSES SOUND FIDELITY 
THE SPEAKERS SUCK! ESPECIALLY IN THE FRONT SEAT 
THE SPEAKERS THAT CONNECT TO MY IPHONE ARE SO CLEAR 
THE SPEAKERS THE QUALITY IS VERY POOR I HAVE TO TURN UP THE VOLUME VERY HIGH IN ORDER TO HEAR IT IF I HAVE THE FAN RUNNING FOR THE HEATER OR THE AC 
THE SPEAKERS THE SOUND FOR THE MONEY I SENT NOT GOOD QUALITY
THE SPEAKERS USING THE HANDS FREE PHONE ISN T HARD TO USE IT S JUST NOT CLEAR THE PARTY AT THE OTHER END HAS A HARD TIME HEARING THEREFORE I RARELY USE THE HANDSFREE PHONE 
THE SPEAKERS WATTAGE IS EXCELLENT THE SOUND IS SHARP AT HIGH VOLUME LEVELS
THE SPEAKERS! THEY SUCK AND TO GET THE BETTER SPEAKERS FROM HYUNDAI YOU HAVE TO BUY THE BETTER PACKAGES THE CHEAPEST ON IS $4500 WHICH INCLUDES STUFF WE DID NOT WANT IN THE VEHICLE EXAMPLE LEATHER SEATS NAVIGATION ETC 
THE SPEAKERS/HEAD UNIT ARE JUST TERRIBLE UNACCEPTABLY BAD FOR A 2015 MODEL 
THE SPEAKERS/SOUND ARE HORRIBLE WHEN THE BACK WINDOWS ARE OPEN 
THE SPEAKERS/SOUND IS WONDERFUL
THE SPEAKERS/SOUND SYSTEM COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER QUALITY 
THE SPEAKERS/SOUND SYSTEM IS NOT THE GREATEST THE MICROPHONE ISN T THE BEST EITHER
THE SPEED
THE SPEED AND RELIABILITY OVERALL
THE SPEED BY WHICH THE BLU TOOTH CONNECTS WITH MY PHONE COULD BE IMPROVED ALSO THERE COULD BE IMPROVEMENTS ON HOW TO SEARCH FOR SPECIFIC TRACKS ON MY IPHONE THROUGH THE TOUCH SCREEN I CAN GET THERE BUT IT TAKES A BIT OF TRIAL AND ERROR AND IS 
THE SPEED OF THE VOICE COMMANDS COULD BE FASTER
THE SPEED OF THE WIPERS DOES NOT GO HIGH ENOUGH I WAS ON THE HIGHWAY 2 WEEKS AGO AND IT WAS RAINING VERY HARD AND MY FIANCé TOLD ME TO TURN THE WIPERS UP HIGHER AND I TOLD HIM THEY DON T GO ANY HIGHER I HAVE NEVER OWNED A CAR THAT DID NOT GO HI 
THE SPEEDOMETER DOESN T HAVE BRIGHT ENOUGH LIGHTS TO BE VERY VISIBLE DURING DAY LIGHT THE AUDIO DISPLAY IS TOO BRIGHT AND DISTRACTING AT NIGHT 
THE SPEEDOMETER IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO READ WHILE DRIVING THE TICKS BETWEEN STATED MILES PER HOUR ALL CLUSTER CLOSE TOGETHER EX 50 MPH HAS ALMOST THE SAME SIZE AS THE TICKS IN BETWEEN I FIND IT A HAZARD FOR DRIVING TO STUDY THE FACE OF 
THE SPLIT BACK WINDOW IS NOT EASY TO SEE OUT OF ESPECIALLY THE LOWER HALF THAT GETS DIRTY QUICKLY LOWERING VISIBILITY 
THE SPLIT LEFT REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A WASTE OF TIME IT WAS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE FIELD OF VIEW BUT IT ADDS NOTHING TO THE ABILITY TO SEE CARS IN THE LEFT BLIND SPOT THE RIGHT REAR CAMERA TURNED ON FROM THE STALK ON THE OTHER HAND IS A GOD S 
THE SPLIT REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE NOT THE BEST AND HARD TO SET WHERE AT LEAST RIGHT REAR VISABILITY IS POOR AS TO VEHICLES OVERTAKING OR PASSING YOU ON RIGHT
THE SPLIT REAR WINDOW HAMPERS REAR VISIBILITY AND TAKES GETTING USED TO 
THE SPLIT REAR WINDOW WITH THE NEARLY FLAT UPPER PART IS ALMOST USELESS
THE SPLIT SCREEN BETWEEN ENTERTAINMENT AND MAP IN HOME FEATURE
THE SPLIT SCREEN IS NOT NECESSARY I D PREFER A BIGGER MAP AND A SMALL AREA SAYING WHAT STATION OR SONG I AM LISTENING TO
THE SPLIT SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR ARE GOOD IDEA BUT NEED REFINEMENT 
THE SPLIT SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO GET USE TO AND CAUSE THE DEPTH OF A CAR NEXT TO YOU APPEAR TO BE FARTHER THAN IT REALLY IS DUE TO THE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MIRRORS USED 
THE SPLIT WINDOW IN THE REAR ON THE HATCHBACK CONTRIBUTES TO THE POOR VISIBILITY TO THE REAR
THE SPOILER ACROSS THE REAR WINDOW MAKES VISIBILITY DIFFICULT BLIND SPOT SENSORS WOULD BE A NICE ADDITION 
THE SPOILER I WOULD OF BEEN HAPPY WITH A LIP OR A SMALLER ONE 
THE SPORT PACKAGE DOESN T CONTAIN NAVIGATION SYSTEMS WOULD LIKE AN ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM PUT IN BECAUSE FACTORY SPEAKERS DON T SOUND VERY GOOD 
THE SPOT MIRRORS SHOULD BE POWER ADJUSTABLE LIKE THE MAIN SIDE MIRROR
THE SPOTTER MIRRORS DEFINITELY HELP WHEN CHANGING LANES SINCE IT S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE SIDE WINDOWS 
THE STANDARD 7 TOUCH SCREEN IS A GREAT DISPLAY 
THE STANDARD SPEAKERS THAT CAME WITH THE CAR ARE INCREDIBLY HIGH QUALITY 
THE STANDARD STEREO IS THE WORST I VE EVEN HAD IN A CAR THE SPEAKERS ARE INCREDIBLY UNDERPOWERED AND BASE DETERIORATES ABOVE 50% VOLUME TOTAL EMBARRASSMENT ON A CAR OF THIS PRICE AND CALIBER 
THE STAR LINK APP WOULD BE BETTER SUITED IF IT COULD BE ADAPTED BY THE USER TO SUIT THEIR APP NEEDS WHEN PLAYING AUDIO VIA BLUETOOTH SUCH AS USING A SCANNER APP IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF THE RADIO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU WERE RECIEVING THAT TYPE OF AU 
THE STARLINK APP IS SO LIMITED THAT I HAVE NEVER USED IT I DON T LIKE PANDORA SINCE I ALREADY SUBSCRIBE TO SPOTIFY SO I HAVE TO USE THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE TO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC I WISH I COULD INSTALL ADDITIONAL APPS ON THE SUBARU BUT FOR NOW I 
THE STARLINK SYSTEM IS BUGGY SOMETIMES IT WORKS GREAT AND OTHER TIMES IT DOES NOT UNLESS YOU DO THINGS IN A VERY SPECIFIC ORDER IT ALWAYS GOES BACK TO SONG 1/X ON AN IPOD IT COULD DEFINITELY BE A LITTLE SMOOTHER IN TERMS OF CONNECTIVITY 
THE START UP TIME TO LOAD THE MAPS AND CONNECT TO MY PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH TAKES TOO LONG ALSO THE FORWARD/BACK BUTTON WHEN USED IN THE FM RADIO MODE SHOULD GO TO THE NEXT OR PREVIOUS PRESET STATION THE FORWARD/BACK BUTTON IS MORE OF A TUNER 
THE START UP TRACTION IS SLIGHTLY DELAYED DUE TO THE ENERGY SAVING SYSTEM I DON T LIKE THAT 
THE STATION HIGHLIGHTING IS OBTUSE DOESN T ALWAYS HIGHLIGHT STATION BUT RATHER THE SET THAT IT S IN 
THE STATION PRESETS SHOULD BE AT BOTTOM THEY ARE HARD TO REACH WHILE DRIVING AT THE TOP
THE STATION SELECT BUTTONS R TO SMALL AND CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE SCREEN THE DIAL IS OLD FASHIONED AND SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH A NUMBER PAD VS HAVING TO TURN THE DIAL TO ANNUALLY SELECT RADIO STATIONS CHRYSLER RADIO IN TOWN AND COUNTRY WAS A 
THE STEERED BEAM HEADLIGHTS AND TURNING LIGHTS HELP TO ILLUMINATE EVEN THE DARKEST OF ROADS 
THE STEERING AND DISPLAY CONTROLS ARE EASY TO USE 
THE STEERING CONTROLS WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH YOUR PRESETS WITH SATELLITE RADIO 
THE STEERING IS RESPONSIVE AND PRECISE 
THE STEERING IS SURGICALLY PRECISE AND THE ACCELERATION IS SO QUICK IT HAS A SAFETY FACTOR TOO 
THE STEERING WHEEL AUDIO CONTROLS ARE MUCH LESS CONVENIENT THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR SWITCHING SOURCE IS ESPECIALLY ANNOYING 
THE STEERING WHEEL AUDIO CONTROLS ARE VERY NICE ALTHOUGH IT TOOK ME A BIT TO FIND ALL OF THEM 
THE STEERING WHEEL BLOCKS SOME OF THE GAUGE PACKAGE 
THE STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS
THE STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS DO NOT HAVE A SEEK FEATURE FOR THE RADIO WHAT THE HELL ELSE SHOULD BE ON THE STEERING WHEEL BESIDES A SEEK BUTTON GM LETS YOU SEEK UP AND DOWN THE RADIO STATIONS THE CENTER BUTTON THAT SELECTS THE SOURCE IS TOO EAS 
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL OF THE RADIO HARD TO SWITCH CHANNELS IT S ALWAYS CHANGING THE SOURCE TO XM OR AM
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL TO ACTIVATE CALLS
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL TO CHANGE THE CHANNLES IS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE I HAVE TO PRESS IT REALLY HARD AND MULTIPLE TIMES 
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS 
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS AND ARE NOT INTUITIVE OR EASY TO USE
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE AMAZING AND MAKE OPERATING THE AUDIO SYSTEM MUCH SAFER 
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE EASY TO USE AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION UNDERSTANDS ALL OF MY REQUESTS
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE NICE AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS DO NOT LIGHT UP AT NIGHT AND IS HARD TO SEE WOULD BE MORE CONVINIENT IF THEY HAD A BACKLIGHT TO THEM
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS DOES NOT SCAN ONLY PRESETS BUT ALSO OTHER NON PRESET STATIONS 
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS FOR RADIO NEED TO BE ON LEFT SIDE INSTEAD OF RIGHT SIDE
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS MAKE THE SYSTEM EASY TO USE
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS THAT ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE TO A DIFFERENT SONG WHEN USING THE SD CARD DOESN T ALWAYS WORK 
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO SCROLL THROUGH MY PLAYLISTS ARE VERY EASY TO USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS EXCEPTIONAL OTHER VEHICLE PROGRAMS HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY RECOGNIZING SPANISH NAMES THIS PROGRAM OFTEN RECOGNIZES THEM 
THE STEERING WHEEL FOLLOWING BACK UP CAMERA IS SUPERIOR TO ANY VEHICLE I VE SEEN / HEARD OF 
THE STEERING WHEEL IS IN THE WAY OF SOME INDICATORS NO MATTER WHAT POSITION IT IS IN 
THE STEERING WHEEL KNOB FOR THE RADIO CONTROLS IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO USE IT EITHER DOESN T SENSE ME TRYING TO SWITCH IT OR MY FINGER SLIPS OFF OF IT HALF THE TIME I GIVE UP AND USE THE DIALS ON THE RADIO WHICH IS KIND OF A REACH FOR ME 
THE STEERING WHEEL MOUNTED PHONE CONTROLS FEEL CLUMSY THERE ARE THREE BUTTONS IN A ROW WHICH MAKES THEM HARD TO PRESS INDIVIDUALLY
THE STEERING WHEEL SHOULD BE ABLE TO LIFT UP A LITTLE HIGHER THEN IT DOES NEEDS A LITTLE MORE LEG ROOM NOT IT LENGTH 
THE STEERING WHEEL SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEEK ALL STATIONS NOT JUST FAVORIATES
THE STEREO COULD BE A LITTLE LOUDER AND COULD USE A SUBWOOFER I DON T USE THE SYNC COMMUNICATION SO I CAN T REALLY SAY IF IT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT OR NOT I MORE OF A MANUAL SETTING PERSON 
THE STEREO DOES NOT SOUND AS GOOD AS OTHER SIMILAR VEHICLES
THE STEREO IS NOT LOUD ENOUGH I THINK THAT YOU SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON A TRUCK LIKE THIS IT SHOULD HAVE A BETTER STEREO 
THE STEREO IS PRETTY GOOD QUALITY OTHER THAN COSMETICS NO CHANGES NEEDED 
THE STEREO ON THE 2 SERIES NEEDS THE 600W AMPLIFIER THAT IS IN THE 3 SERIES 
THE STEREO SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESUME PLAYING THE FLASH DRIVE RIGHT WHERE IT LEFT OFF I HAVE THE BASIC 6 SPEAKER SYSTEM AND IT IS NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH THERE SHOULD BE SPEAKERS IN THE REAR WINDOW DECK FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT I CAN REALLY ONLY HEAR TH 
THE STEREO SOUNDS BETTER AND MORE POWERFUL WHEN LISTENING TO A MOVIE THAN LISTENING TO MUSIC SURPRISINGLY BLAND YOU D THINK WITH ALL THE SPEAKERS YOU WOULD BE IMMERSED IN SOUND NO SO 
THE STEREO SOUNDS GOOD BUT WHEN I MAKE CALLS THE PERSON ON THE OTHER LINE HAS A HARD TIME HEARING ME 
THE STEREO SOUNDS VERY CLEAR
THE STEREO SYSTEM IS NOT THAT GREAT I READ IT WAS EQUIVALENT TO TSX STEREO AND I WOULD HIGHLY DISAGREE BLUETOOTH IS ALSO WEIRD ON THE VOLUME LEVELS NAVIGATION I WISH I COULD DO MORE WHILE I M DRIVING 
THE STEREO SYSTEM IS RATHER PEDESTRIAN NOT VERY EXCITING DESIGN ELEMENTS
THE STEREO SYSTEM SOUNDS LIKE I M IN A NIGHT CLUB AND REALLY CAPTURES ALL FREQUENCIES IN A GREAT WAY 
THE STOCK SOUND SYSTEM IS REALLY GREAT NO COMPLAINTS THE STOCK RADIO AND CD WORK GREAT NO COMPLAINTS HERE WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT MY TRUCK DIDN T COME WITH A NAVIGATION SYSTEM OR SATELLITE RADIO I INSTALLED AN AFTER MARKET SYSTEM AND IT WORKS 
THE STOCK SPEAKERS ARE HORRIBLE VIRTUALLY NO BASE AND THE HIGH FREQENCIES ARE SQUEAKY 
THE STOCK SPEAKERS COULD DEFINITELY BE IMPROVED 
THE STOCK SPEAKERS SOUND AMAZING!
THE STOCK WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES HAVE GOTTEN A TEAR ON THEM IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS THAT IVE HAD THE VEHICLE 
THE STOP AND START TECHNOLOGY IS NOT SOMETHING I LIKE THE CAR JERKS WHEN IT STARTS UP AGAIN 
THE STRICTNESS OF THE SYNTAX FOR THE NAV SYSTEM CAN BE FRUSTRATING BUT IT WORKS GREAT
THE STRUCTURE OF THE SLOPING ROOF CAUSES ME TO TURN MY HEAD WHEN CHANGING LANES I AM NOT COMFORTABLE CHANGING LANES ONLY USING THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS 
THE STUNNING 17 SPEAKERS AND SOUND QUALITY
THE STUPID WOMAN DOESN T UNDERSTAND ALL THE TIME AND SHE DOESN T RESPOND WHEN YOU TRY TO SWEAR AT HER 
THE STYLE IN THE DASHBOARD LOOKS CHEAP AND CH EESY 
THE STYLING AND KNOBS THAT CONTROL IT 
THE STYLING I LOVE SO MUCH CAUSING THE REAR WINDOW AND SIDE GLASS BETWEEN THE C AND D PILLARS TO BE SMALLER THAN I D LIKE FOR VISIBILITY THAT SAID LARGE SIDE MIRRORS HELP ALSO INCLUSION OF BLIND SPOT MONITORING AS STANDARD ON ALL MODELS WOULD 
THE STYLING IS VERY SLEEK BUT THE PHRASING OF COMMANDS CAN BE SHORTENED TO MAKE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY THE VOICE COMMAND OPTIONS SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO BE INTERRUPTED WHEN THE COMMAND THE USER IS LOOKING FOR IS FOUND 
THE STYLING OF THE HEADLIGHTS IS REALLY COOL AND HAS A GERMAN TWIST TO THEM 
THE STYLING OF THE ROOFLINE MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE MORE THAN 100 YARDS OR SO BEHIND THE VEHICLE SINCE THE TOP OF THE REAR WINDOW IS BELOW THE HORIZON FORWARD VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT BUT REARWARD VISIBILITY IS HINDERED BY THE SMALL REAR WIND 
THE SUB CHARGING ETC CORDS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCESS WHILE DRIVING AND DIFFICULT IN THE ARM REST
THE SUB WOOFER IS MUCH LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE ONE IN THE 2010 CX9 GO BACK TO THE BETTER ONE 
THE SUB WOOFER PUTS IT ALL TOGETHER 
THE SUBARU CRASH TEST RESULTS WERE A BIG CONSIDERATION FOR ME 
THE SUBARU IMPREZA IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SEE IN REAR VIEW MIRROR AND SIDE MIRRORS GOOD VISIBILITY AND SAFETY ARE A TOP PRIORITY AND THE FIRST THING I CHECK WHEN SEEING ABOUT GETTING A NEW VEHICLE 
THE SUBARU STARLINK APP DOES NOT WORK WELL I HAVE LOADED IT MULTIPLE TIMES AND IT ONLY WORKS ON OCCASION DEPENDING ON HOW RURAL THE AREA I AM TRAVELING
THE SUBWOOFER WAS MUCH NEEDED
THE SUDIO QUALITY WHEN I USE THE BLUETOOTH IS VERY POOR ALDO THE MICROPHOEN ONLY PICKS UP THE DRIVER S VOICE IF A PASSENGER IS SPEAKING THEIR VOICE IS HARDLY PICKED UP
THE SUN MAKES THE GLASS VERY GLOSSY LOOKING 
THE SUN REFLECTS OFF THE INTERIOR TRIM AROUND THE AC/VENTS ONTO THE SIDE MIRRORS AND CAUSES DISTRACTION THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE
THE SUN ROOF DON T GO ALL THE WAY BACK
THE SUN ROOF SCREEN IT SHOULD BLOCK TOTALLY THE SUN
THE SUN VISITORS SHOULD HAVE EXTENDERS THAT COME OUT TO INCREASE SUN BLOCKAGE
THE SUN VISOR ABOVE THE DRIVERS DOOR IS SUCH TREAT ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE LIVES IN FLORIDA 
THE SUN VISOR COULD BE A LITTLE LONGER 
THE SUN VISOR COULD BE A LITTLE LONGER IN DEPTH 
THE SUN VISOR COULD BE A LITTLE WIDER WHEN I PULL IT DOWN TO BLOCK THE SUN IT IS ABOUT AN INCH OR TWO TOO SHORT SO I HAVE TO RAISE THE SET TO HELP BLOCK OUT THE SUN 
THE SUN VISOR COULD HAVE A SUN GLASS TYPE OF SHADE INSIDE THE VISOR THAT COULD BE PULLED DOWN FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE UNDER 5 4 ALSO HAVE YOU CONSIDER A SCREEN OPTION FOR THE DRIVER PASSENGER AND FRONT WINDSHIELD FOR THOSE OF US THAT LIVE IN T 
THE SUN VISOR DOES NOT HAVE AN EXTENDER ON IT WHICH IS NOT GOOD IT AT LEAST SHOULD HAVE ONE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE 
THE SUN VISOR HAS BEEN REDESIGNED FROM OLDER MODELS AND THE EXTENSION IS NO LONGER THERE THAT WAS DIAPPOINTING 
THE SUN VISOR IN THE REAR IS GREAT FOR BLOCKING THE SUN BUT CAN SOMETIME INCREASE BLIND SPOTS
THE SUN VISOR IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH 
THE SUN VISOR IS SMALL 
THE SUN VISOR IS SMALL I WISH IT HAD A SLIDING PANEL THAT WAY IT WILL COVER MORE SPACE WHILE ON POSITIONED OVER THE THE DRIVER S DOOR WINDOW 
THE SUN VISOR IS TINY I REALIZE THIS CAR IS MADE IN JAPAN & THE PEOPLE ARE TINY BUT COME ON!!!! SORRY FOR THE CAPS 
THE SUN VISOR IS TO SHORT IN LENGTH
THE SUN VISOR IS TOO SHORT SHOULD OFFER THE ABILITY TO EXTEND AS NEEDED 
THE SUN VISOR IS TOO SHORT SUCH THAT THE SUN IS OFTEN GLARING IN MY EYES AS I DRIVE WHILE USING THE VISOR THIS IS A MAJOR DESIGN FLAW 
THE SUN VISOR IS TOO SMALL 
THE SUN VISOR IS TOO SMALL AND SHORT 
THE SUN VISOR IS USELESS WHEN USED TO THE LEFT SIDE IT STOPS BEFORE IT BLOCKS THE SUN THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS ARE IN THE WAY I ACTUALLY TAKE THEM OUT WHEN NO ONE IS SITTING IN THE BACK 
THE SUN VISOR IS VERY FLIMSY LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BREAK BEFORE MY LOAN IS PAID OFF CHEAP DESIGN 
THE SUN VISOR ISSUE THAT I HAVE IS ACTUALLY THE FACT THAT THE SUN VISORS ARE TOO SMALL I HAVE ISSUES BLOCKING THE SUN WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE THE VISOR S SMALL SIZE THE HEADREST IN THE MIDDLE REAR SEATS AT TIMES BLOCKS SOME OF THE VIEW WHEN I M 
THE SUN VISOR NEEDS TO BE BIGGER AND LONGER 
THE SUN VISOR NEEDS TO BE BIGGER ON SEVERAL OCCAISIONS I WAS UNABLE TO PULL THE SUN VISOR DOWN LOW ENOUGH TO BLOCK THE GLARE FROM THE SETTING SUN I HAD TO USE MY HAND TO SHIELD MY EYES FROM THE SUN S GLARE AND DRIVE WITH ONE HAND THIS HAS 
THE SUN VISOR NEEDS TO BE LARGER IT DOES NOT BLOCK THE SUN WELL ALSO THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL 
THE SUN VISOR NEEDS TO BE LONGER DUE TO THE MIDDLE PART WHERE THE SUNROOF CONTROLS ARE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A LONG SUN VISOR THEREFORE I SUGGEST EXTENDERS I HAD A NISSAN AND BUILT INTO THE SUN VISOR WAS A PIECE I COULD EXTEND AND RETRA 
THE SUN VISOR NEEDS TO HAVE AN EXTENSION WHEN YOU PUT IT TO PROTECT YOU FROM SUN SHINING ON SIDE WINDOW IT S NOT LONG ENOUGH MANY TIMES 
THE SUN VISOR ON DRIVER S SIDE CANNOT BE MOVED FROM FRONT TO SIDE WITHOUT MOVING THE SEAT BACKWARDS OTHERWISE THE VISOR CONNECTS WITH THE HEADREST MAKING THE VISOR STICK HALFWAY BETWEEN THE FRONT AND SIDE REAR VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN IN TH 
THE SUN VISOR SEEMS A BIT WEAK FOR A GREAT CAR LIKE THIS IT S SMALL 
THE SUN VISOR SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE SHORT NOT AS EFFECTIVE FOR SHORTER PERSONS 
THE SUN VISOR SHOULD BE EXTENDABLE IT IS DIFFICULT TO BLOCK THE SUN IN THE CORNER 
THE SUN VISOR WAS NOT CHANGED FROM THE CONVERTIBLE TO THE HARD TOP SO IT ONLY FACES FORWARD AND DOES NOT TURN TO THE SIDE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO CHANGE/IMPROVE SINCE IT CAN GET ANNOYING IF THE SUN IS LOW AND TO THE SIDE 
THE SUN VISOR WHEN MOVED TO THE SIDE POSITION DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH COVERAGE 
THE SUN VISOR WILL BENEFIT FROM GETTING REDESIGNED THE CURRENT MODEL IS TOO SMALL AND DOES NOT OFFER SUN PROTECTION I CHANGED FROM A CHEVROLET I LOVE THE FACT THAT THE CAMRY HAS THE SAME GOOD REAR VISIBILITY 
THE SUN VISORS ARE A BIT LONG AND CAN ACTUALLY BLOCK MY VIEW WHILE DRIVING 
THE SUN VISORS ARE A BIT SMALL 
THE SUN VISORS ARE A BIT UNFAIR TO JUDGE BECAUSE USUALLY I AM TO SHORT TO REALLY USE THEM NOT REALLY THE VEHICLES FAULT

THE SUN VISORS ARE ABOUT FOUR INCHES WIDE AND REALLY DON T SERVE ANY PURPOSE 
THE SUN VISORS ARE ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS! THEY ARE TOO SMALL TO EFFECTIVELY BLOCK THE SUN ESPECIALLY ON THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR!
THE SUN VISORS ARE ALMOST USELESS BUT ALMOST EN POINTE IF THAT MAKES SENSE IT S ALMOST IF A BREAK WAS CALLED AND THEY HADN T QUITE FINISHED THE BASICS THOUGH THE OVERALL IDEA IS VERY GOOD #1 WAY TOO SMALL EVEN WITH EXTENSIONS VISOR ITSELF 
THE SUN VISORS ARE ALWAYS AN ISSUE FOR PEOPLE ON THE SHORTER SIDE ONCE THE SUN IS SETTING DOWN AM ALMOST NEVER ABLE TO USE THE VISORS ITS A BIG ISSUE I WISHED MANUFACTURES COULD FIX MAYBE WITH ADJUSTABLE ADVISORS TO PULL DOWN JUST LIKE THEY ARE 
THE SUN VISORS ARE BARELY EFFECTIVE THEY ARE TOTAL INEFFECTIVE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO BLOCK THE SUN FROM THE SIDE WINDOW 
THE SUN VISORS ARE CHEAPLY MADE AND TOO SHORT 
THE SUN VISORS ARE EXTREMELY SHORT SINCE I AM SHORT IN HEIGHT I DON T FIND THEM EFFECTIVE UNLESS I CRANK UP THE HEIGHT EXTREMELY HIGH ON THE SEAT ADJUSTMENT

THE SUN VISORS ARE KINDA TINY
THE SUN VISORS ARE LITTLE SMALL 
THE SUN VISORS ARE NOT BIG ENOUGH VERY INADEQUATE
THE SUN VISORS ARE NOT LARGE ENOUGH THEY SHOULD EXTEND ALL THE WAY TO THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND BE DEEPER IN WIDTH SO IT COVERS MORE OF THE WINDSHIELD FOR SHORTER DRIVERS BEING I AM ONLY 5 3 AND 1/2 TALL THE SUN VISORS IN CARS ARE NEVER DEEP E

THE SUN VISORS DO NOT WORK WELL FOR ME BECAUSE I AM TOO SHORT FOR THEM 
THE SUN VISORS DON T COVER ALL THE WAY BACK NEXT TO THE DOORS IN THE BACK WHY NOT ALLOW THE VISOR TO EXTEND ALL THE WAY TO THE PILLAR? I SIT WITH THE SEAT ALL THE WAY BACK AND GET ANNOYED WHEN THE VISOR DOESN T BLOCK ALL THE WAY TO THE PILLAR

THE SUN VISORS GIVE VERY LITTLE HELP TO KEEP THE SUN OUT OF YOUR EYES IT IS VERY SMALL AND HAS NO EXTENSIONS TO BLOCK THE SUN AROUND THE VISOR IF IT WAS A BIT BIGGER IT WOULD BE BETTER 
THE SUN VISORS IN THE 2011 MURANO HAD THE PLASTIC EXTINTION THAT ALLOWED MORE COVERAGE THEN THE 2015 YOU TOOK THAT FEATURE OUT AND LEFT THE VISOR TO BE PULLED AWAY FROM THE ELBOW AND THAT ISN T AS GOOD AS THE 2011 MODEL 
THE SUN VISORS JUST DON T DO ANYTHING WORTH WHILE 
THE SUN VISORS JUST SEEM TO SMALL AND THEY ARE NOT LIGHTED WHICH I AM NOT SURE IF THAT IS AN EXTRA OPTION OR NOT I SEARCHED PORSCHE S WEBSITE FOR AN OPTION LIKE THIS FOR THE MACAN AND DID NOT FIND ANYTHING THOUGH IT MAY BE SOMETHING IN A BUNDLED 
THE SUN VISORS LACK EXTENSIONS FOR WHEN USING THEM ON THE SIDE WINDOWS THE WINDSHIELD LACKS A DARK TINT STRIP AT THE TOP 
THE SUN VISORS NEED A SLIDING EXTENSION THAT WILL ALLOW FOR GREATER COVERAGE WHEN THE SUN IS LOW IN THE SKY OR COMING FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE CAR 
THE SUN VISORS NEED A SMALL PULL OUT EXTENSION TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE!
THE SUN VISORS NEED EXTENDERS TO THE CENTER AND THE OUTER EDGES THEY DO NOT PROVIDE NEARLY ENOUGH COVERAGE AGAINST THE RISING / SETTING SUN 
THE SUN VISORS NEED EXTENSIONS BUILT IN SO THEY CAN BE PULLED OUT WHEN NEEDED DO AWAY WITH THE VANITY MIRRORS IF YOU HAVE TO AND PUT IN VISOR EXTENSIONS 
THE SUN VISORS NEED LITTLE PULL OUTS TO EXTEND THE RANGE THAT THEY CAN BLOCK OUT THE SUN AT DIFFERENT DRIVING ANGLES 
THE SUN VISORS NEED SIDE EXTENSIONS BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES TO CUT GLARE WHEN DRIVING AT ODD ANGLES TO THE RISING OR SETTING SUN 
THE SUN VISORS NEED TO EITHER EXTEND OR OTHERWISE BE MORE ADJUSTABLE ESPECIALLY FOR WHEN USING ON THE SIDE WINDOWS THE SIDE DOOR MIRRORS HAVE BUILT IN SMALL WIDE ANGLE MIRRORS BUT I DON T FIND THEM USEFUL I CAN T SEEM TO FIND A MIRROR ADJUSTMEN 
THE SUN VISORS NEED TO HAVE EXTENSIONS

THE SUN VISORS ONLY FOLD UP DOWN AND TO SIDE IT SHOULD ALSO EXTEND OUT 
THE SUN VISORS SEEM A LITTLE SHORT SO SOMETIMES ARE NOT EFFECTIVE IN BLOCKING OUT THE SUN WHILE DRIVING 
THE SUN VISORS SEEM A LITTLE SKIMPY COULD BE WIDER 
THE SUN VISORS SEEM A LITTLE SMALL I WISH THERE WAS A SECTION THAT COULD FOLD DOWN FURTHER FOR WHEN I M DRIVING AT SUNSET

THE SUN VISORS SHOULD HAVE A SLIDE OUT EXTENDER 
THE SUN VISORS SHOULD HAVE EXTENDERS THAT CAN BE USED WHEN TURNED TO THE SIDE THEY SHOULD ALSO COME DOWN A LITTLE LOWER THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHERE THE FRONT WINDOW ATTACHED TO THE LITTLE WINDOW ON THE SIDES

THE SUN VISORS SUCK 
THE SUN VISORS TURN TO JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE TO BLOCK THE SUN AS NEEDED 
THE SUN VISORS WERE MADE SO SMALL THAT THEY ARE COMPLETELY USELESS NO BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
THE SUN VISORS WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY HAD AN ADJUSTABLE PLATE TO WIDEN THE COVERAGE WHEN USING AGAINST THE SIDE WINDOW 
THE SUN VISORW COULD BE A ALITTLE BIGGER
THE SUNVISORS ARE FINE FOR THE FRONT BUT THEY DEFINITELY NEED AN EXTENSION FOR THE SIDES THEY ARE SHORT SO WHEN YOU NEED THEM FROM THE SIDE THEY ARE VIRTUALLY WORTHLESS I HAD TO BUY AFTERMARKET EXTENSIONS 
THE SUNVISORS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE AS THEY ARE TOO SMALL AND DO NOT BLOCK THE SUN AT ALL 
THE SUNVISORS ARE TOO SHORT AND NOT WIDE DEEP ENOUGH FOR DRIVERS/PASSENGERS OF AVERAGE HEIGHT I HAVE THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS SET TO COVER THE BLIND SPOTS AS OPPOSED TO LEAVING THEM IN THE STANDARD POSITION THIS WORKS GREAT BUT DOES REQUIRE RE 
THE SUNVISORS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE TO SLIDE SO THAT YOU GET BETTER COVERAGE WHEN USING THEM ON THE SIDE WINDOW
THE SUPPORT ON THE RIGHT SIDE BETWEEN THE FRONT AND SIDE WINDOW KIND OF BLOCKS THE VIEW WHEN MAKING A RIGHT TURN 
THE SUPPORTS ON EACH SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD BETWEEN ROOF AND BODY SEEM TO BLOCK A LOT OF SPACE FOR VIEWING AT INTERSECTIONS AND WATCHING FOR SIDE TRAFFIC
THE SURROUND SOUND AND SOUND QUALITY RIVAL THE TOP AFTERMARKET SYSTEMS 
THE SURROUND SOUND ASPECT OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING 
THE SURROUND SOUND OF THE SPEAKERS JUST SOUNDS AMAZNG
THE SURROUND SOUND QUALITY IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE SURROUND SOUND SEEMS TO BE LESS THAT I EXPECTED 
THE SWIPING VOLUME CONTROLS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN ARE SUPER FANCY AND COOL THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE THE MOST USED BECAUSE THEY RE EASY TO ACCESS WHILE DRIVING 
THE SWITCHING BETWEEN AUDIO PREFERENCES COULD BE MADE EASIER IT TAKES MULTIPLE STEPS 
THE SWIVELING ADAPTIVE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT AS PRONOUNCED OF AN EFFECT IN ACTION AS ON OTHER VEHICLES I VE OWNED 
THE SYNC APP IS HORRIBLE AND RARELY WORKS HARD TO NAVIGATE REFERRING TO IPHONE COMPATIBILITY MOST FRUSTRATING IS APPLE WONT ALLOW TEXT TO SPEECH VIA BT UNLIKE ABNDROID
THE SYNC INTERFACE IS HARD TO USE WHEN DRIVING I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME USING THE HARD BUTTONS AS THE SCREEN DOES NOT ALWAYS DO THE CORRECT ACTION WHEN PRESSED 
THE SYNC IS A LITTLE TEMPERMENTAL SOMETIMES BUT HAS BEEN IN MOST VEHICLES
THE SYNC SYSTEM
THE SYNC SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED SEE OTHER COMMENTS IN SURVEY REGARDING THIS 
THE SYNC SYSTEM IS COMPLICATED IF BROWSING FOR MUSIC ON A CONNECTED IPOD & THE TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVITY IS A LITTLE UNRESPONSIVE 
THE SYNC SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE IT HAS AGGRAVATING PROBLEMS WHEN COMMUNICATING WITH AN IPHONE VIA USB AND ALWAYS DEFAULTS TO FM RADIO IF THE USB IS DISCONNECTED WHICH HAPPENS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE IT S MY PHONE THERE IS NO WAY TO SET THE DEFAULT TO 
THE SYNC SYSTEM IS SO USER FREINDLY 
THE SYNC TOUCH INTERFACE IS TOO CLUNKY 
THE SYNC VOICE RECOGNITION
THE SYNCING OF BLUE TOOTH/HANDS FREE CALLLING
THE SYSETEM FOR FINDING ADDRESSES IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A LITTLE CUMBERSOME 
THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY RECOGNIZES MY COMMAND EASY TO USE 
THE SYSTEM AS A CLEAR INTERACTIVE VOICE
THE SYSTEM BARELY RECOGNIZES ANY COMMANDS DESPITE SEVERAL RETRAINING ATTEMPTS DOESN T EVEN RECOGNIZE COMMANDS LISTED IN THE MANUAL!
THE SYSTEM CAN T READ OR CREATE TEXT MESSAGES FROM AN IPHONE IT SEEMS THIS FEATURE IS ONLY FOR ANDROID PHONES SAMSUNG 
THE SYSTEM CONFUSES IF THE CELL PHONE IS CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH AND USB AND NAVIGATION IS ONE IT SOMETIMES THINGS THE NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS ARE CALLS AND IS NOT ABLE TO SWITCH BETWEEN MUSIC AND NAVIGATION TURN BY TURN DIRECTIONS FROM THE CELL 
THE SYSTEM CONNECTS WITH MY PHONE EVEN WHEN I M NOT USING IT AS IF I HAVE A CALL
THE SYSTEM COULD PICK UP MY VOICE BETTER 
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THE IPHONE IS AVAILABLE NOT SURE IF THIS AUDIO OR PHONE ISSUE I HAVE THE BEATS SPEAKERS NOT OVERLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SOUND/PERFORMANCE GIVEN THE COST 
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND MY VOICE COMMANDS WHEN COMPOSING TEXT MESSAGES AND I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOAD MY PHONE CONTACTS INTO THE CAR SYSTEM 
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE GOOD POINTS OF INTEREST THE NAVIGATION IS HARD TO INPUT A DESTINATION IT TAKES TOO MANY STEPS TO SELECT THE REGION STATE ADDRESS STREET ECT 
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT RECEIVE STRONG AM SIGNALS NOT SURE IF THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE CHANNEL OR THE AUDIO SYSTEM/ANTENNA 
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE ARTIST OR ALBUM I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY I HAVE TO TRY SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT WILL WORK 
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MY COMMANDS EVEN AFTER REPEATING MULTIPLE TIMES 
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT UNDERSTAND SOUTHERN ACCENT WELL ALSO THERE SHOULD BE AWAY THAT EVERY TIME YOU HIT THE ACTIVATION BUTTON YOU SHOULDN T HEAR THE SAME MESSAGE 
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH IPHONE I CAN GET THE SYSTEM TO READ AND SEND TEXT MESSAGES CONSISTENTLY IT SHOULD BE INTUITIVE WITH THE US MOST POPULAR MOBILE PHONE APPLE IPHONE I WOULD LEAVE TO SEE A PROGRAM CHANGE TO IMPROVE THE TEXT AND 
THE SYSTEM DOESN T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND MY COMMANDS WHEN BLUETOOTH IS CONNECTED IT S ALSO SOMETIMES HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSON YOU ARE TALKING TO WHEN IT COMES OVER BLUETOOTH I M NOT SURE HOW TO IMPROVE THAT THOUGH 
THE SYSTEM DOESN T RECOGNIZE COMMANDS AS WELL AS IT SHOULD
THE SYSTEM DOESN T RECOGNIZE FOREIGN NAMES AS EASILY AS IT RECOGNIZES ANGLO SAXON NAMES AS A RESULT SOME FOREIGN NAMES MUST BE DIALED 
THE SYSTEM IS A LITTLE COMPLEX BUT IT WORKS AND SOUNDS GOOD
THE SYSTEM IS AWESOME IT SOUNDS GREAT 
THE SYSTEM IS COMPLEX ENOUGH THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO USE SOME OF THE FEATURES WHILE DRIVING I FIND IF I TAKE THE TIME WHILE NOT DRIVING TO LEARN THE SYSTEM BETTER IT IS THEN EASIER TO USE WHEN DRIVING OVERALL YOU STILL HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT T 
THE SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO LEARN I HAVE NOT USED SOME OF THE FEATURES YET JUST BECAUSE IT REQUIRES TIME AND EFFORT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT 
THE SYSTEM IS EASILY ACCESSED ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND IS VERY SIMPLE/UNDERSTANDABLE TO USE 
THE SYSTEM IS EASY TO NAVIGATE 
THE SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE FOR THE MOST PART 
THE SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE HOWEVER ANYTIME I TRY TO PLACE A CALL AND TALK WHILE DRIVING THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END TELLS ME THEY HEAR TOO MUCH ROAD NOISE SO I END UP TAKING IT OFF BLUETOOTH AND JUST TALK ON MY PHONE TOO BAD BECAUSE THIS 
THE SYSTEM IS FAR MORE FRIENDLY TO USE THAN IN OUR HONDA OR TOYOTA OUR 2014 TOYOTA HAS BECOME SECOND BEST THE SPEAKERS ARE BOSE AND ARE FAR ABOVE THE NORMAL STUFF VOICE RECOGNITION IS SHOCKINGLY EASY TO USE 
THE SYSTEM IS FINE AS IS 
THE SYSTEM IS FINE BUT IT IS TOO DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS
THE SYSTEM IS GOOD BUT IT COULD BE BETTER WE DID NOT PURCHASE A BETTER PACKAGE 
THE SYSTEM IS GOOD IT IS EASY TO USE WHILE DRIVING I CAN ANSWER CALLS AND LISTEN TO MUSIC THE STEERING WHEEL IS AWESOME!
THE SYSTEM IS GOOD THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE CAR IS SOMETIMES NOISY ON THE ROAD
THE SYSTEM IS GOOD WHEN I USE IT BUT I DON T LISTEN TO MUSIC MUCH EXCEPT MAYBE ON A LONG TRIP 
THE SYSTEM IS GREAT LIKE ALL ASPECTS
THE SYSTEM IS GREAT WITH DIRECTIONS BUT VOICE RECOGNITION TERRIBLE
THE SYSTEM IS JUST SO EASY TO USE! IT IS INTUITIVE IN IT S CONTROLS AND COMMANDS THE LEARNING CURVE WAS NOT VERY STEEP TO LEARN TO USE IT!
THE SYSTEM IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS OTHERS I HAVE SEEN IN OTHER BRANDS OF VEHICLES IT HAS TAKEN A WHILE TO GET USED TO LOOKING FORWARD TO APPLE HAVING THEIR SYSTEM AVAILABLE IN CARS
THE SYSTEM IS NOT EASE TO UNDERSTAND AND WE ARE TOO LAZY TO READ THE MANUAL
THE SYSTEM IS NOT INTUITIVE AND TO USE WHILE YOU ARE DRIVING YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD I HAD A RANGE ROVER EVOQUE AS A RENTAL AND IT WAS MUCH EASIER TO USE THEIR SYSTEM 
THE SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY IT IS VERY LIMITING IN STATION SELECTION VERY SLOW AND FRUSTRATING 
THE SYSTEM IS NOT VERY INTUATIVE WISH THEY HAD MADE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY 
THE SYSTEM IS OK BY FACTORY STANDARDS BUT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WERE THE KENWOOD SYSTEM THE KENWOOD IS INTUITIVE AND USES GARMIN FOR THE NAVIGATION 
THE SYSTEM IS OUTDATED MANY OTHER VEHICLES HAVE BETTER TOUCH SCREEN AUDIO AND NAV SYSTEMS AVAILABLE FOR THE PRICE PAID 
THE SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING
THE SYSTEM IS PROBABLY FINE BUT I NEED MORE TUTELAGE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE AUDIO CONTROL FUNCTION I STILL PREFER MANUAL KNOB TYPE CONTROLS OVER VOICE CONTROL OR EVEN TOUCH SCREEN BECAUSE I AM USED TO IT 
THE SYSTEM IS SIMPLE TO USE BUT THE THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS ISN T THAT GREAT AND THERE AREN T VERY MANY SPEAKERS I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE PAID A LITTLE MORE FOR THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM IT GETS THE JOB DONE BUT IT S NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT 
THE SYSTEM IS THE BEST I HAVE SEEN VERY INTUITIVE
THE SYSTEM IS THE MOST ADVANCED I VE SEEN

THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW AND THE NAV SYSTEM IS NOT AS GOOD AS USING GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE I WISH I HAD NOT PAID EXTRA FOR THE NAV SYSTEM 
THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW WHEN SWITCHING THROUGH SCREENS ESPECIALLY THE IPOD PLAYLISTS THE SYSTEM TENDED TO GUESS AT ADDRESSES WHEN TYPING THEM IN MANUALLY RANDOMLY LEADING ME TO GO BACK OFTEN AND FIX THE STREET ADDRESS 
THE SYSTEM ITSELF WORKS AS YOU WOULD EXPECT IT TO WORK ACCESSABILITY TO DIALS AND THEIR FUNCTIONALITY IS FANTASTIC THE OVERALL APPEARANCE OF THE SYSTEM IS/WAS VERY NICELY DONE BY THE ENGINEERS 
THE SYSTEM LOCKS UP 
THE SYSTEM MAKES EXTENSIVE USE OF TOUCH SCREEN AND FLUSH PRESSURE ACTIVATED BUTTONS BOTH ARE HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING A GOOD ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE CONVENTIONAL BUTTONS THAT YOU CAN FEEL WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK DOWN 
THE SYSTEM MAY BE BETTER BUT WE ARE HAVING PROBLEMS LEARNING HOW TO USE IT NEED BETTER INSTRUCTIONS ON ITS USE 
THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO ALWAYS DEFAULT TO THE DRIVER S RADIO PRESETS AS IT IS I HAVE TO TAKE MY ATTENTION FROM THE ROAD EACH TIME I DRIVE TO GET TO THE STATIONS I WANT AND HAVE PREVIOUSLY SET UP SAME WITH PLAYING THE HARD DRIVE I LIKE TO SET IT FOR 
THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE EASIER TO USE AND UNDERSTAND I HAVE A VERY WELL EDUCATED AN INTELLIGENT PERSON AND I FIND I HAVE SPENT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME ATTEMPTING TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE IT
THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE HANDS FREE AS STATED IN MY EARLIER COMMENT 
THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE INTUITIVE
THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE SIMPLE TO USE WHILE DRIVING ITS HARD TO CHANGE FROM AN FM STATION TO MEDIA DEVICE THE DEALER SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED THE SYSTEM BETTER THE OWNERS MANUAL IS ALMOST USELESS BECAUSE IT COVERS NOT ONLY THE RADIO IN THE CAR 
THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO INTERFACE WITH APPLE IPHONES FOR TEXT MESSAGING 
THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO KEEP MY PHONE DIRECTORY IN IT WHEN I AM IN THE CAR ALSO RECOGNIZE THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM MY VOICE 
THE SYSTEM OF DIALING IN THE DESTINATION IS NOT VERY GOOD BUT IT MAY BE A MATTER OF JUST GETTING USED TO IT 
THE SYSTEM OF THE RADIO SOUNDS GOOD
THE SYSTEM OFFERS VARIOUS METHODS FOR INPUTS WHICH MAKES USING IT FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT KINDS OF TASKS EASY TO MANAGE EVERYTHING WORKS WELL QUICKLY AND AS EXPECTED INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT TASKS IS DISPLAYED WITH REASONABLE CONSISTENCY I A 
THE SYSTEM S UI IS SET UP PRETTY INTELLIGENTLY I DIDN T FEEL LIKE I HAD TO LEARN A WHOLE NEW SYSTEM HOWEVER SOMETIMES IT FAILS TO SAVE SETTINGS 
THE SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE RELATIVELY EASY TO USE AND THE DISPLAYS ARE EXCELLENT
THE SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE SLOW TO REACT AT TIMES BUT EVERYTHING WORKS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF FEATURES FOR THE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE 
THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE EASIER TO ACCESS AND USE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME IF YOU ARE TRULY INTERESTED 310 350 3978
THE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT DEFAULT TO MAP THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS HORRIBLE THE CHANNEL SELECTION PAGE AND AUDIO FORMAT WAS MUCH BETTER ON OLDER 2102 MODEL 
THE SYSTEM SHOULD SCROLL MY FAVORITES FIRST AND KNOW THEM BY FIRST NAME BEFORE ACCESSING THE REST OF MY CONTACTS 
THE SYSTEM SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL
THE SYSTEM SOUNDS GREAT GOOD DYNAMIC RESPONSE AND A NICE EXPANDED STAGE SOUND 
THE SYSTEM SOUNDS GREAT ISN T HARD TO USE JUST ANNOYED THAT I HAD TO BUY ALL OF THE PACKAGES TO GET THE FEW I WANTED 
THE SYSTEM SOUNDS PURE AND CRISP EVEN AT LOW VOLUMES 
THE SYSTEM SYNCS TO PHONE WITH EASE
THE SYSTEM TAKES A LONG TIME TO DOWNLOAD CONTACTS AND TEXT MESSAGES IN THAT TIME I CAN T USE THE PHONE AS A MEDIA DEVICE AND NEED TO TURN BLUETOOTH OFF AND THEN ON AGAIN IF I MISSED THE FEW SECONDS I HAVE TO CANCEL THE PHONE DOWNLOAD IT CAN BE 
THE SYSTEM TAKES TOO LONG TO BOOT UP I LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA FUNCTION BUT I MAY HAVE COMPLETED BY BACKUP BEFORE THE SYSTEM FINISHES BOOTING 
THE SYSTEM USES A SPECIFIC AUX CORD FOR THIS CAR ONLY WOULD BE GOOD IF YOU COULD USE A IPHONE USB TO PLUG IN ALSO BLU TOOTH DOESN T WORK TO PLAY MUSIC FROM CELL THE RADIO IS VERY BASIC AND SO ARE THE SPEAKERS 
THE SYSTEM WAS HARD TO USE AT FIRST UNTIL I TOOK THE TIME TO READ THE OWNERS MANUAL THE MOUSE/POINTER IS SENSITIVE TO USE AND IS NOT INTUITIVE THE POINTER ALSO TAKES UP ROOM ON THE ARMREST CONSOLE 
THE SYSTEM WILL BLUETOOTH PHONE BUT NOT AUDIO IN A 2015 AGAIN MY MISTAKE FOR PURCHASING SAME I DIDN T THINK IT WOULD BOTHER ME THAT MUCH BUT MY OTHER VEHICLE HAS ALL OF THESE KIND OF FEATURES AND YES IT DOES HAVE SAT BUT AGAIN THE HONDA IS A 
THE SYSTEM WILL NOT GET MESSAGES FROM MY PHONE PHONE IS SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 RUNNING ANDROID 5 0 2
THE SYSTEM WORKS GOOD BUT IS SLOW THE SPEED IN WHICH IT PROCESSES COMMANDS OR RESPONDS WOULD BE BETTER IF QUICKER ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING 
THE SYSTEM WORKS GREAT OTHER THAN THE OCCASIONAL DISCONNECTION VIA BLUETOOTH 
THE SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL AND LIKE ALL NEW CARS IT TAKES AWHILE TO GET USE TO IT I HAVE HAD MY CAR FOR 4 MONTHS AND IT IS VERY EASY TO USE AND TO VIEW 
THE SYSTEMS ARE EASY TO USE AND I LOVE THE VOICE COMMANDS EASE
THE SYSTEMS ARE NEW TO ME THUS FAR I AM ENJOYING USING THEM 
THE SYSTEMS ARE VERY GOOD HOWEVER THE INSTRUCTIONS NEED TO BE CLEARER ON PROGRAMMING THE SYSTEMS
THE SYSTEMS WORK GREAT I AM SURPRISED THAT SATELLITE RADIO IS NOT INCLUDED IN CAR 
THE TACOMA NEEDS TO HAVE MORE POWER
THE TACOMA PREVIOUSLY HAD A DISPLAY COMPASS THIS HAS BEEN DELETED?
THE TAILGATE BAR PARTIALLY BLOCKS REAR VISIBILITY 
THE TECH PACKAGE COSTS TOO MUCH
THE TECH PACKAGE HELPS THE VISIBILITY BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT THAT GOES ON WHEN THERE IS SOMEONE IN MY BLIND SPOT� LOVE THE CAR!
THE TECHNOLOGY IN MY Q50 IS TOP NOTCH NO COMPLAINTS 
THE TECHNOLOGY ON THIS IS JUST POORLY DESIGNED IT IS HARD TO USE AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS AWFUL THE MAP NAVIGATION IS GOOD WHEN YOU CAN GET IT TO WORK EASILY IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WANT AND THEN STILL HAS A HARD TIME 
THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL ALL OF THE FEATURES MAKE DRIVING SAFER 
THE TECHNOLOGY USED FOR BLUETOOTH SYNCING OF PHONES IS STILL NOT VERY GOOD I HAD A HONDA CROSSTOUR WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY ERASED MY CONTACTS FROM MY PHONE BOOK EVERY FEW MONTHS MY WIFE HAS A HONDA CRV AND HER CALL QUALITY THROUGH HER CAR S SYSTEM 
THE TECHNOLOGY USED IS OUTDATED PORSCHE NEEDS TO BUY A TESLA AND LEARN HOW TO DO INTERIORS THE MUSIC SYSTEM IS GREAT BUT EVERYTHING ELSE SUCKS POOR VOICE RECOGNITION ANCIENT MAPS WHY NOT JUST USE GOOGLE MAPS? OR WAZE? THEY ALSO HAVE THE AHA 
THE TELEPHONE CONNECTION YIELDS MUCH BACKGROUND NOISE NOT SURE BUT AN ENGINEER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM 
THE TERRAIN RESPONSE SYSTEM WORKS GREAT AND KEEPS YOU MOVING EVEN IN SEVERE WINTER CONDITIONS WHILE OTHER CARS STRUGGLE
THE TEXT FOR THE SONG INFO COULD SCROLL
THE TEXT MESSAGE PORTIONOF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY
THE TEXT MESSAGE READING FEATURE IS TERRIBLE MULTIPLE TIMES IT CONTINUES TO NOTIFY YOU OF A MESSAGE REPEATEDLY EVEN AFTER IT HAS BEEN READ IT HAS BEEN SUCH A PROBLEM THAT I DISABLED IT 
THE TEXT MESSAGING SYSTEM IS THE BEST EVER 
THE TEXT TO MESSAGE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR APPLE PRODUCTS ALL OF MY FAMILIES PHONES ARE APPLE THE BLUETOOTH AND USB DON T COOPERATE ALL OF THE TIME WHEN PLAYING MUSIC THIS IS THE ONLY DISAPPOINTING FEATURE OF THE VEHICLE
THE TEXT/SMS SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK AT ALL
THE TEXTING FUNCTION IS NOT USABLE
THE THAT YOU NEED TO BUY DEVICE FROM THE DEALER IN ORDER TO USE BLUETOOTH
THE THE SOUND
THE THICKNESS AND LOCATION OF THE FRONT PILLARS IS A SAFETY HAZARD SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE NEARLY PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF A CAR COMING FROM THE RIGHT WHEN AT A STOP SIGN THE FRONT RIGHT PILLAR CAN COMPLETELY BLOCK THE DRIVER FROM SEEING A CAR COMI 
THE THICKNESS OF THE FRAME AROUND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO VIEW ONCOMING TRAFFIC FROM THE RIGHT WHEN SITTING IN THE DRIVER S SEAT ALSO THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR JAMB GETS IN THE WAY WHEN CHECKING THE BLIND SPOT I WISH CHEVY HAD NOT 
THE THICKNESS OF THE FRAME BETWEEN THE DRIVER S SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD AND THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW WHICH MAY BE PART OF THE ROLL CAGE CREATES A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT FOR ANYTHING TO THE FRONT LEFT SIDE OF THE DRIVER I E WHEN GOING AROUND A CURV 
THE THICKNESS OF THE FRAMED AREA JUST BEHIND THE DRIVER S DOOR MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE INTO YOUR BLIND SPOT 
THE THIRD ROW HEAD RESTS BLOCK THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE VIEW WHEN BACKING VEHICLE INTO PARKING SPOT MUST HAVE HEAD RESTS IN DOWN POSITION WHICH IS THEN UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THIRD ROW PASSENGER ALSO PASSENGER SIDE WIPER BLADE ENDS IN THE MIDDLE O 
THE THREE MEMORY CLUSTERS FOR FM SIRIUS ETC ARE IRRITATING YOU ARE FORCED TO GO INTO TWO MENUS TO SCROLL THROUGH ANY MORE THAN THE CHANNELS IN ANY ONE CLUSTER THIS SHOULD ALL BE ONE YOU CAN SCROLL THROUGH LIKE IN A BMW THE NAVIGATION SHOU 
THE THUMB CONTROLLER ON THE STEERING WHEEL 
THE TILTING SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AND THE BACK UP CAMERA WITH PROXIMITY SENSOR ARE NICE THE OVERALL VIEW FROM INSIDE THE CAR TO THE OUTSIDE IS SURPRISINGLY EXCELLENT SPITE THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE 
THE TIME AND TEMPERATURE SHOULD BE HIGHER AND EASIER TO READ WHEN THE SUN IS OUT ONE HAS TO SHADE THE NUMBER WITH MY HAND IN ORDER TO READ IT 
THE TIME IT TAKES FROM WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED UNTIL THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS READY TO ACCEPT A DESTINATION BY VOICE COMMAND COULD BE REDUCED 
THE TIME REQUIRED TO ACTIVATE THE BLUE TOOTH
THE TIMELINES OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MUCH IMPROVED 
THE TINT ON THE WINDSHIELD PREVENTS HEADLIGHT GLARE AT NIGHT 
THE TINTED REAR WINDOW MAKES IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE AT NIGHT
THE TINTED WINDOWS MAKE IT HARD TO SEE OUT THE REAR AND BACK WINDOWS WHILE CHANGING LANES AND BACKING UP 
THE TINTED WINDOWS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE THAT IS HAPPENING AROUND YOU 
THE TIRES HAD OVER 40 PSI AND IT SLID A BIT CROSSING A DRY BRIDGE WHEN IT WAS 18F OUT IT WAS UNEXPECTED FOR CONDITIONS AND EXPERIENCE 
THE TIRES HANDLE POTHOLES ADMIRABLY
THE TOGGLE BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL ONLY GOES THROUGH 6 PRESET CHANNELS WOULD LIKE IT TO GO THROUGH ALL 18 
THE TOGGLE IS HARD TO USE 
THE TOM TOM DEVICE THAT PLUGS IN THE TOP OF THE DASHBOARD IS NEARLY USELESS AND OBSTRUCTS THE DRIVER S VISION WAY TOO MUCH I ONLY USED IT ONCE OR TWICE AND DISCONNECTED IT 
THE TOM TOM NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS PLACED IN A POOR LOCATION IT BLOCKS THE VIEW OF MOVING VEHICLES LIGHTS ON MY RIGHT MOST OF THE TIME I TOOK IT OFF SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON T WANT TO MISS SEEING TURN SIGNALS FROM OTHER CARS
THE TOM TOM STUCK ON THE DASH LOOKS LIKE A COMPLETE AFTERTHOUGHT I REALIZE IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A COMPLETE REDESIGN OF THE RETRO LOOK TO DO ANYTHING ELSE BUT IT JUST DETRACTS FROM THE CLEAN LOOK OF THE CAR IT S THE ONLY REAL LOW MARK I CAN GI 
THE TONE IS GORGEOUS 
THE TONE OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM ALLOWS THE BEST RECOGNITION OF WORDS AND MUSIC MOST IMPORTANT WHEN DRIVING BY NAVIGATION COMMANDS THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLE 
THE TONE QUALITY WHEN LISTENING TO SATELLITE RADIO IS AWESOME!
THE TORQUE VECTORING AWD SYSTEM MAKES CORNERING IN EVEN THE WORST CONDITIONS SO MUCH BETTER AND SAFER I REALLY PUSHED IT HARD IN SNOWY/ICY CONDITIONS WHEN THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC TO TEST IT I WAS VERY IMPRESSED 
THE TOTAL VISIBILITY PACKAGE IS EXCELLENT 
THE TOUCH ASPECT IS NOT QUITE SENSITIVE OR PRECISE ENOUGH 
THE TOUCH ASPECT OF THE ENTERTAINMENT/NAVIGATION COULD BE IMPROVED SOMETIMES IT RECOGNIZES MY TOUCH AND OTHER TIMES IT DOES NOT I ADDRESSED THIS PROBLEM ON AN EARLIER COMMENT REGARDING THE INTERIOR 
THE TOUCH BUTTONS ON CHANGING THE RADIO STATIONS COULD BE LARGER
THE TOUCH CONTROL HAS DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING COMMANDS SOMETIMES 
THE TOUCH CONTROLLER IS THE ISSUE INABILITY OF SYSTEM TO ADJUST TO ADDRESSES IT DOES NOT HAVE IN MEMORY JUST NOT ENOUGH SOFTWARE BEHIND THE SYSTEM IT IS THE AMOUNT AND DETAIL OF THE SOFTWARE THAT IS THE PROBLEMS NOT THE MISTAKES IN THE SOFTWARE 
THE TOUCH CONTROLS ARE NOT AS RESPONSIVE AS I WOULD LIKE NEED TO REPEATEDLY TOUCH TO PUT ON HEATED SEATS AND CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE 
THE TOUCH CONTROLS ARE NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND 
THE TOUCH FOR THE RADIO IS TOO SENSITIVE SOMETIMES I WILL TOUCH IT AND IT WILL SKIP TO ANOTHER SATELLITE AND IS DIFFICULT TO GET THE OTHER ONE BACK I HAVE HAD TO PULL OF THE ROAD TO ADJUST IT 
THE TOUCH IS VERY SENSITIVE
THE TOUCH PAD DIAL & GOOGLE MAPS
THE TOUCH PAD FOR OPERATING THE SYSTEM IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE I CONSIDER THIS THE WORSE THING ABOUT THE CAR 
THE TOUCH PAD IS CONVENIENT AND EASY TO USE
THE TOUCH PAD LETTER RECOGNITION SYSTEM COULD USE SOME REFINING 
THE TOUCH PAD MOUSE IS SOMETIMES TOO SENSITIVE I HAVE A POWER CORD PLUGGED INTO THE AUX POWER PORT IN THE CENTER CONSOLE AND THAT CORD WILL OFTEN ACTIVATE THE TOUCH PAD
THE TOUCH PAD TO CONTROL EVERYTHING IS TOO SENSITIVE ANDHAS TO BE VERY PRECISE TO GET EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT MOST TIMES I USE THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL IF POSSIBLE BECAUSE I FIND THEM MUCH EASIER TO USE ALTHOUGHT YOU CAN T USE THEM FOR 
THE TOUCH SCREEN
THE TOUCH SCREEN 
THE TOUCH SCREEN ACCESS TO PHONE OR RADIO IS VERY HARD TO OPERATE THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS YOU HAVE TO PRESS BEFORE GETING TO THE PLACE YOU NEED ALSO WHEN USING VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PHONE CALLS IT KEEPS TELING THAT MULTIPLE ENTRIES WERE FOUN 
THE TOUCH SCREEN AND INTERNAL HARD DRIVE WERE HUGE SELLING POINTS FOR ME

THE TOUCH SCREEN AUDIO CONTROLS 
THE TOUCH SCREEN AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE IT IS HIGH TECH YET SIMPLE IT IS EASIER TO USE THAN WHAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH OTHER BRANDS OF VEHICLES SUCH AS TOYOTA S ENTUNE SYSTEM 
THE TOUCH SCREEN BUTTONS ARE FAIRLY SMALL AND EASY TO MISS THE INTENDED BUTTON WHILE DRIVING OR EVEN AS PASSENGER

THE TOUCH SCREEN COULD BE MADE MORE USER FRIENDLY 
THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY 
THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY AND EASE OF USE 
THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY AND HOW EASY IT IS TO INTERFACE DEVICES WITH THE SYSTEM EXCELLENT WORK
THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY COMBINED WITH BOTH THE SATELLITE AND AM/FM RADIO IS GREAT!
THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY COULD BE LARGER AND THE DISPLAY COULD GIVE MORE INFORMATION SUCH AS THE NAME NAME OF THE SINGER AND NAME OF SONG PLAYING 
THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY IS BOTH EASY TO VIEW/READ AND ACCESS 
THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY IS REALLY EASY TO USE 
THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY ON THESE NEW OUTBACKS IS AMAZING LARGE AND CLEAR IT IS LIKE TAKING AN IPAD MINI WITH RETINA DISPLAY AND ROTATING IT ON ITS SIDE I FEEL LIKE I COULD HAVE A GREAT MOVIE EXPERIENCE ON IT 
THE TOUCH SCREEN DOES NOT GIVE ME ENOUGH TIME TO SELECT THE SOURCE WHEN I M DRIVING 
THE TOUCH SCREEN DOES NOT OPERATE CONSISTENTLY ALL OF THE TIME THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS THAT ALLOW THE DRIVER TO ACCESS ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING AND ARE BIT CONFUSING BASICALLY I THINK THERE IS MORE CAPABILITY TO THE SYSTEM THAT I 
THE TOUCH SCREEN DOESN T ALWAYS RESPOND WHEN TOUCHED OR ELSE IT RESPONDS TOO MUCH I HAVE TO HAVE THE EXACT RIGHT TOUCH TO GET THE RIGHT STATION 
THE TOUCH SCREEN FEATURE IS A LITTLE ANNOYING AS YOU HAVE TO DELIBERATELY TOUCH/PRESS THE DESIRED APPLICATION WITH FORCE MUCH MORE SO THAN OF A TOUCH THAN IS REQUIRED USING A IPHONE ETC 
THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR AUDIO IS NOT USER FRIENDLY AND CONFUSING 
THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR CHANGING STATIONS AND MENU OPTIONS IS DIFFICULT TO USE SOMETIMES IT RESPONDS IMMEDIATELY AND OTHER TIMES ONE HAS TO TOUCH THE SCREEN MANY TIMES TO EFFECT A CHANGE SOMETIMES IT CHANGES TO AN OPTION THAT YOU DON T WANT 
THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR THE RADIO CONTROLS VERY EASY TO USE AND LESS DISTRACTION THAN WITH KNOBS 
THE TOUCH SCREEN FORCES YOU TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD ACTUAL PRESS BUTTONS WOULDN T 
THE TOUCH SCREEN GETS VERY CONFUSING WHEN TRYING TO DRIVE AND MAKE CHANGES TO THE RADIO 
THE TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE FEELS SLOW COMPARED TO MODERN SMART PHONES AND TABLETS IT FEELS LIKE IT TAKES 1 3 SECONDS FOR THE INTERFACE TO REACT AFTER PRESSING MOST FEATURES 
THE TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE IS HORRIBLE IT S EXTREMELY SLOW IN TERMS OF RESPONSE TIME AND IT TAKE AS LONG AS 30 SECONDS FOR THE RADIO TO TURN ON WHEN THE CAR IS INITIALLY STARTED AND AS LONG AS A MINUTE FOR MY PHONE TO PAIR IT S BY FAR THE SLOWES 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS A BIT DATED IN APPEARANCE HAS A LAG BETWEEN TOUCH AND SCREEN CHANGE 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS AWKWARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING MY EYES HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROAD TOO LONG I WISH I COULD CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE DISPLAY 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO SCROLL IT MOST OFTEN GOES TO WHERE I TOUCH RATHER THAN SCROLLING
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE EVEN NOW THAT I AM USE TO THE SYSTEM I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DESIGNED 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME CHANGING STATIONS WHILE DRIVING I ONLY RELY ON THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO CHANGE STATIONS 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING THE ONE TIME I USED THE ON STAR SYSTEM I DID NOT LIKE THE WAY IT WORKED COMPARED TO MY TOMTOM GPS FROM A PREVIOUS VECHICLE 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO UTILIZE WHILE DRIVING AND WOULD BE NICE IF IT COULD BE CONTROLLED WITH A DIAL WHILE DRIVING AND THE TOUCHSCREEN WHILE STOPPED

THE TOUCH SCREEN IS EASY TO USE AND EASY TO READ!
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS EASY TO USE AND THE SOUND SYSTEM IS AMAZING

THE TOUCH SCREEN IS EXCELLENT 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS GREAT 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS HARD TO CHANGE FAT FINGERS?
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS HARD TO READ WHEN IT IS SUNNY OUTSIDE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF VISOR OR SOMETHING TO HELP SHADE THE SCREEN TO MAKE IT EASIER TO READ 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS INCREDIBLE
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS INCREDIBLE RESPONDS VERY QUICKLY ALL AUDIO SOUNDS GREAT AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS REALLY EASY TO USE 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS LARGE AND EASY TO READ IS LOCATED IN A CONVENIENT SPOT THAT MINIMIZES THE AMOUNT OF TIME I NEED TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS LARGE AND EASY TO USE WHILE DRIVING WHETHER IT S USING THE RADIO OR ANSWERING/PLACING A CALL USING VOICE RECOGNITION 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS MY FAVORITE EVERYTHING IS IN ONE SPOT AND EASY TO USE WITH MINIMAL DISTRACTION FROM THE ROAD
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NICE ON ALL ASPECTS EXCEPT GETTING FAVORITE AUDIO CHANNELS TO COME UP THEY HIDE AND YOU DRAG THEM UP AND I AM MOST TIMES UNABLE TO RETRIEVE SO I USE THE STEERING WHEEL COMMANDS 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT RESPONSIVE TO TOUCH THE SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE THE SATELLITE RADIO CLICKS OFF AT AN UNDERPASS A TRESTLE NEAR A ROCK ETC 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT VERY SENSITIVE OR WHEN I TRY TO CHOOSE FROM A LIST OF NAMES OR CHANNELS IT OFTEN GOES TO THE ONE ABOVE OR BELOW THE ONE I WANT AND I HAVE SMALL HANDS THE NAVIGATION IS A LENGTHY PROGRESS TO GET YOUR DESTINATION ENTERED 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS REALLY FANTASTIC IT S RESPONSIVE IN A GREAT WAY EVEN WHEN I M WEARING GLOVES THE AM/FM AND SATELLITE RADIOS ARE REALLY WELL SET UP AND EASY TO USE 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS SLOW TO RESPOND

THE TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY DARK WITH SUNGLASSES ON THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT CAN BE ADJUSTED I WILL TAKE THE CAR TO THE DEALER TO SEE IF THIS CAN BE DONE IF NOT THIS WOULD SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CHANGED IN THE FUTURE 
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY EASY TO USE AND THE HD RADIO IS VERY CRISP WITH EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY

THE TOUCH SCREEN MENU OPTIONS ARE CUMBERSOME IT S MULTI LAYERED AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO GET USED TO USING IT TO BECOME PROFICIENT AT IT ABOUT 6 MONTHS IT COULD BE MADE MUCH SIMPLER 
THE TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED SOMEHOW IT IS DIFFICULT WHEN DRIVING IF A ROAD IS BUMPY FOR INSTANCE SCROLLING THE CONTACTS IS IMPOSSIBLE UNLESS I PULL OVER WHEN STOPPED OR IF A PASSENGER IS USING IT MUCH BETTER 
THE TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS TO BE LARGER AND IT DOES NOT SAVE MY FAVORITES IN THE CONTACTS SECTION LIKE IT SHOULD IT ONLY SAVES THEM WHILE MY PHONE IS CONNECTED IF I SWITCH TO ANOTHER PHONE THEN SWITCH BACK MY FAVORITES IN MY CONTACTS ARE GONE 
THE TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS TO BE MORE SENSITIVE 
THE TOUCH SCREEN RADIO CHANNEL BUTTONS COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER FOR THOSE OF US WITH FAT FINGERS 
THE TOUCH SCREEN RADIO SCREEN NEEDS TO BE LARGER 
THE TOUCH SCREEN RADIO STATION SELECTION I HAVE TOUCHED THE DESIRED SELECTED STATION ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WITH NO RESPONSE THE RADIO PUSH BUTTONS WORKED BETTER 
THE TOUCH SCREEN REQUIRES TOO MANY STEPS TO USE WHILE NGDRIVING
THE TOUCH SCREEN SELECTION OF STATION PRESETS IS VERY CONVENIENT

THE TOUCHSCREEN IN MY RAV4 IS MUCH EASIER TO USE WHILE DRIVING 
THE TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE IS RATHER DULL

THE TOUCHSCREEN IS SOMETIMES SLOW TO RESPOND THERE IS NO POWER BUTTON FOR THE RADIO/STEREO JUST A PAUSE AND MUTE 
THE TOUCHSCREEN IS VERY RESPONSIVE 
THE TOUCHSCREEN NAVIGATION IS INTUITIVE FOR THE MOST PART AND EASY TO LEARN AND USE 
THE TOUCHSCREEN SYSTEM IS NOT GOOD BUT ONCE IT STARTS TO PLAY THE SPEAKERS SOUNDS EXCELLENT I LIKE THE EQUALIZER FEATURES AND THAT ADDS TO THE QUALITY 
THE TOUCHSCREEN USER INTERFACE IS HARD TO USE WHEN DRIVING 
THE TOW MIRRORS ON THE HD TRUCKS ARE JUST NOT AS APPEALING OR AS EFFECTIVE AS FORDS HATE TO SAY IT BUT THEY GOT YOU BEAT THERE! GO AHEAD AND JUST COPY THEM 
THE TOWING MIRRORS ARE OUTSTANDING 
THE TOWING MIRRORS ARE VERY HELPFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES ON THE INTERSTATE
THE TRAFFIC ALERT I E RED YELLOW GREEN LINES NEXT TO ROADS COULD BE MORE ACCURATE 
THE TRAFFIC ALERTS ALWAYS SAY NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE WHEN I AM TRY TO ACCESS IT AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE WHICH I DON T UNDERSTAND SINCE I WAS TOLD THIS WAS ALL DONE BY SATELITE SO IT SHOULD BE ACCURATE 
THE TRAFFIC APP IS NOT VERY GOOD OR USEFUL IN FACT IT S PRETTY BAD 
THE TRAFFIC APP JUST DOESNT WORK I AM SITTING IN DEAD STOP TRAFFIC AND THE TRAFFIC APP SAYS GREEN 
THE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS DISPLAY IS PREDICTIVE NOT REAL TIME WHICH MISSES MANY TRAFFIC PROBLEMS ON THE WEEKENDS I HAVE TO USE TRAFFIC APPS ON MY SMART PHONE FOR TRUE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS 
THE TRAFFIC CONTROL FEATURE DOESN T WORK AND TEXT MESSAGES RECEIVING DOESN T WORK I E I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED SIGNALS ALTHOUGH THE SETTINGS ALLOWS TO DO SO

THE TRAFFIC GRAPHICS ARE VERY CLUTTERED THICK COLOR LINES FOR SURFACE STREETS OBSCURE FREEWAY TRAFFIC COLOR LINES VERY POOR 
THE TRAFFIC INFO IS WRONG SOME OF THE TIME 
THE TRAFFIC INFO SERVICE IS POOR AND NOT VERY GOOD OPERATIONALLY IT IS USELESS TO ME THE NAVIGATION SOMETIMES GIVES RIDICULOUS ROUTES
THE TRAFFIC INFORMATION DOES NOT APPEAR FOR ALL MAJOR ROADS FOR EXAMPLE TRAFFIC IS SHOWN FOR I80 IN NJ BUT NOT FOR I287 PORTIONS OF THE NJ TURNPIKE ALSO DO NOT APPEAR 
THE TRAFFIC INFORMATION IS COMPLETELY RANDOM AND UNHELPFUL THE NAVIGATION IS POOR AT BEST AND CAN ONLY BE CONTROLLED THROUGH VOICE WHILE DRIVING IT IS ESSENTIALLY WORTHLESS 
THE TRAFFIC INFORMATION IS NOT CURRENT WHICH LEADS TO WRONG DRIVING ROUTES 
THE TRAFFIC NOTIFICATIONS ARE AWFUL! THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM GIVES YOU IRRELEVANT TRAFFIC INFORMATION AND IT S NOT EASY TO SILENCE IT OR TURN OFF THAT SETTING THIS NEEDS TO BE RETHOUGHT ENTIRELY 
THE TRAFFIC PART OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK I PLAN TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR 
THE TRAFFIC SYSTEM IS LOUSY THE GUIDANCE SYSTEM IS SUB PAR VERY DISAPPOINTING AT THIS PRICE POINT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS OK BUT THE LOOK AND FEEL IS VERY DATED
THE TRAFFIC UPDATES ON ROUTES OF EXPRESSWAYS HIGHWAYS ETC IS NOT IN REAL TIME THE DELAY CAUSES YOU TO END UP IN TRAFFIC WHICH YOU WOULD WANT TO AVOID 
THE TRAILER MIRRORS ARE HARD TO SEE AROUND WHEN TURNING SOMETIMES
THE TRAVERSE IS A SOLID CAR I FEEL SO SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR 
THE TRAX IS A PERFECT SIZED VEHICLE FOR ME IT SITS UP HIGHER THAN ECONOMY CARS MAKING VISIBILITY GREAT THE SIDE MIRRORS ALLOW FOR PERFECT VISIBILITY MAKING FREEWAY TRAVELING EASIER AND SAFER 
THE TRAX S PRICE AND CONNECTIVITY FEATURES WERE THE MAIN REASON I CHOSE THIS VEHICLE OVER MANY OTHERS 
THE TRIANGLE GLASS NEXT TO THE WINDSHIELD MAKES VIEWING DIFFICULT 
THE TRIANGLE WINDOW IN THE BACK SEAT IS IN THE WAY WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD TO THE RIGHT TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS THERE ALSO THE CHROME AROUND THE CENTER DASHBOARD DISPLAY REFLECTS ON THE INSIDE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND IS VERY ANNOYING TO SEE MA 
THE TRIM OF THE VEHICLE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE NEAR BOTTOM OF WINDSHIELD SOMETIMES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE THINGS THAT ARE IN FRONT AND SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE VEHICLE 
THE TRUCK IS DESTINED SO THAT YOU DO NOT NEED TO LOOK BEHIND OR AROUND YOU IT S TRULY AMAZING
THE TRUCK IS ONLY NAV READY NOT HAPPY WITH THAT
THE TRUCK REALLY NEEDS BUILT IN CONVEX MIRRORS ALTHOUGH MY TRUCK HAS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM WITHOUT THE AFTERMARKET CONVEX MIRRORS IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES ALONGSIDE OF THE VEHICLE 
THE TRUCKS AUDIO IS OUTSTANDING
THE TRUNK GOES UP AND I CANNOT SEE THE REAR I DO NOT LIKE REAR CAMERAS I WANT TO SEE I ALSO WANT TO SEE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON THE REAR WINDOW
THE TRUNK HAS A HUMP IN THE BACK THAT MAKES IT HARD FOR ME TO SEE THE REAR TRAFFIC OR WHEN BACKING UP 
THE TRUNK LINE SEEMS HIGH FROM INSIDE WHICH LIMITS VISIBILITY ON BACKING 
THE TRUNK OPENING TO TOO SHALLOW TO PLACE LUGGAGE IN EASILY 
THE TUCH SCREEN DISPLAYS THE NAME OF THE SONG AND ARTIST WHEN THE RADIO IS PLAYING
THE TUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE ON UNEVEN ROAD 
THE TUNER TO CHANGE CHANNELS FOR THE RADIO IS IN A BAD PLACE AND I CANNOT REMEMBER WHERE IT IS
THE TURBO MOTOR
THE TURN BY TURN HAS BEEN SUPERB 
THE TURN SIGNAL INDICATOR LIGHTS IN THE DASH ARE REALLY HARD TO SEE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON THERE IS A HEADLIGHT INDICATOR LIGHT THAT IS JUST BELOW THE LEFT SIGNAL INDICATOR THAT IS THE SAME COLOR AND IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT LIGHT A 
THE TURN SIGNAL IS TOO FAR FROM THE STEERING WHEEL WHEN IN NORMAL LIGHT MODE IT SITS WHERE MOST CARS ARE IN HIGH BEAM MODE WHEN IN HIGH BEAM MODE IT S HARD TO REACH THE TURN SIGNAL I M NOT SURE IF I LIKE THE AUTOMATIC HIGH BEAMS THERE AR 
THE TURN SIGNAL LIGHTING IN THE EXTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRRORS IS SO BRIGHT THAT IT IS VERY DISTRACTING 
THE TURN SIGNALS IN THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS ARE DISTRACTING TO THE DRIVER WOULD BUY OPTION OF BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM 
THE TURN SIGNALS IN THE LEFT MIRROR IS SO BRIGHT AT NITE THAT YOU CAN NOT SEE A VEHICLE COMING SO I PUT DUCT TAPE OVER IT TO LESSON THE GLARE I CAN SEE LAW SUITS COMING OVER THIS ISSUE JUST LIKE GM KEY ISSUE
THE TURN SINGLE IN THE CAMPERMIRRORS ARE TO BRIGHT AT NIGHT
THE TURNING RADIUS NEEDS TO BE SMALLER FOR EASIER PARKING ETC 
THE TWO ANGLE MIRROR ON THE PREVIOUS MODEL TOOK SOME GETTING USED TO BUT WA SVERY EFFECTIVE THIS IS MISSING ON THE 2015 WHICH MAKES CHANGING LANES LESS SAFE WHY WAS IT REMOVED?
THE TWO BARS ON THE SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD IS A BIT TOO BIG AND HARD OUT
THE TWO HUGE ISSUES I HAVE REGARDING THE AUDIO/VIDEO SYSTEM ARE THE LACK OF SEEK UP AND SEEK DOWN BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL FOR THE FM AND XM RADIO STATOINS YOU CAN ONLY USE THEM UP AND DOWN BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO SCAN THRU PRE PROG 
THE TWO MIRRORS ON DRIVER S SIDE MIRRORS ARE GREAT ESPECIALLY SINCE IT IS NOT A SINGLE WIDE MIRROR 
THE TWO MOST FRUSTRATING THINGS ABOUT MY CAR S AUDIO COMMUNICATION AND ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM ARE 1 THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE NOISE CANCELLATION SOFTWARE FOR HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS THIS PROHIBITS ME FROM BEING ABLE TO USE THE SYSTEM WHEN TRAVELING 
THE TWO REAR WINDOWS DONT REALLY HELP MUCH CHANGING LANES BUT IS STILL EASY TO CHECK BLIND SPOTS OUT OF FRONT SIDE WINDOWS 
THE TWO SCREEN SET UP IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE THERE SHOULD ONLY BE A SINGLE DISPLAY OR CONSUMERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO USE MULTIPLE DISPLAYS TO COMPLETE A FUNCTION EACH SCREEN SHOULD CONTROL DIFFERENT OPERATIONS 
THE TWO TONE INTERIOR
THE U CONNECT INTERACTION WITH APPLE IPHONES COULD BE UPDATED TO ENABLE TEXT MESSAGING
THE UCONNECT 8 4 SCREEN IS THE BEST SYSTEM OUT THERE VIRTUALLY NO LAG WHATSOEVER ON THE TOUCHSCREEN MENUS AND ICONS ARE LOGICALLY PLACED EXTREMELY EASY TO USE 
THE UCONNECT APP REQUIRED FOR USING IN CAR APPS IS JUNK I ONLY SUCCESSFULLY USED IT THREE TIMES MOST OF THE TIME IT WOULD CAUSE MY SMARTPHONE NOT TO BE DETECTED AFTER I UNINSTALLED UCONNECT FROM MY PHONE IT EASILY CONNECTS AS A BLUETOOTH MEDIA 
THE UCONNECT APP WHEN CONNECTING VIA BLUETOOTH DOES NOT ALWAYS CONNECT SEEMS A BATTLE TO GET IT WORKING EACH TIME I START THE CAR ALSO ONE SWITCHING BETWEEN APPLICATIONS THERE IS A NOTICEABLE LAG
THE UCONNECT FEATURES LIKE PANDORA HAVE DIFFICULTIES SYNCING AT TIMES I STILL HAVE NO BEEN ABLE TO SYNC MY PHONE BOOK WITH THE PHONE SYSTEM
THE UCONNECT SAYS TO PRESS THE PHONE BUTTON TO END A CALL BUT THIS DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK PRESSING THE RED END BUTTON ON THE DISPLAY SHOULD BE THE DESCRIBED METHOD 
THE UCONNECT TOUCH SCREEN AND CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL
THE UNIQUE LOOK OF JUKE!
THE UNIT TAKES FOREVER TO SCROLL THROUGH AN IPOD LOOKING FOR MUSIC 
THE UNITS ARE EASY TO ACCESS WHILE DRIVING I DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO LOOK AT THE RADIO NAVIGATION SYSTEM HARDLY FOR NAVIGATION OR ANYTHING ELSE ON THE CONSOLE 
THE UP DOWN VOLUME BUTTON SHOULD BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF STEERING WHEEL
THE UPDATED MY LINK IS GREAT
THE UPGRADE FROM TOUCHSCREEN TO A MOUSE TO ACTIVATE DEVICE
THE UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM SOUND QUALITY WITH FLOOR SUBWOOFERS IS FANTASTIC 
THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM IS AMAZINGLY CLEAR THE SPEAKERS ARE LOCATED AND CALIBRATED PERFECTLY 
THE UPGRADED SPEAKERS ARE OPTIONAL ON OUR 2015 PREMIUM SUBARU IMPREZA THESE SPEAKERS SHOULD BE STANDARD ON THIS MODEL 
THE UPGRADED STERO SYSTEM SHOULD PROVIDE BETTER SOUND SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE UNDER POWERED AND NEEDS HIGHER QUALITY SPEAKERS I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST A HIGHER POWERED AMPLIFIER 
THE UPGRADED TOUCH SCREEN RADIO SHOULD BE STANDARD 
THE UPSWEPT DESIGN OF THE REAR DOOR PANELS PARTIALLY OBSTRUCTS THE DRIVER S VIEW 
THE US CARS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME SCREEN SIZE AS THE EU CARS AT 5 8 THIS SCREEN IS FAR TOO SMALL 
THE USB BLUETOOTH SOMETIMES IS VERY SCRATCHY EVEN WHEN PLAYING AUDIO 
THE USB CABLE IS TOO SHORT IT S PROBABLY OPERATOR ERROR ME BUT I CAN T SEEM TO USE THE BLUETOOTH WITH MY SIRI FUNCTION OF MY CELL PHONE I NEED A LESSON FROM ONE OF MY KIDS!
THE USB CONNECTED AUDIO DOES NOT EASILY CONNECT AND PLAY AUTOMATICALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BLUETOOTH AUDIO FROM MY PHONE/DEVICE 
THE USB CONNECTION AND BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY ALLOW ME EXCEPTIONAL STREAMING FROM MY IPHONE AND IPOD 
THE USB CONNECTION IS NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE SOMETIMES THE SYSTEM DOESN T RECOGNIZE MY IPOD IS CONNECTED THROUGH THE USB AND I M FORCED TO USE THE AUX CONNECTOR MY USB CORD IS NOT DAMAGED AND HAS BEEN PLUGGED INTO THE USB PORT SECURELY ALSO ALLOW 
THE USB CONNECTION IS RATHER CUMBERSOME IN THAT IT FREEZES QUITE FREQUENTLY AND WILL SKIP AROUND MUSIC APPS 
THE USB CONNECTION STOPS WORKING FROM TIME TO TIME NEEDS TO BE FIXED 
THE USB CONNECTION WORKS VERY WELL IT DOESN T CUT OUT AT ALL
THE USB CONNECTIVITY DOESN T WORK WITH MY CELLPHONE TO PLAY MUSIC IT BARELY CHARGES MY DEVICE PROPERLY EITHER I HAVE TO USE A USB STICK WHICH IS INCONVENIENT SEEING AS HOW I HAVE ALL MY MUSIC ALL ON ONE DEVICE ALREADY THE RADIO CONTROLS ARE 
THE USB FOR MY IPOD AND THE SOUND SYSTEM ARE MY FAVORITE EASY TO USE USB AND THE SOUND SYSTEM IS FAR ABOVE THE AVERAGE SYSTEM 
THE USB INPUT OFFERS FLEXIBILITY FOR A USB DRIVE IPOD IPHONE ETC 
THE USB INTERFACE IS STUPID IT HAS A BAD HABIT OF LOSING ITS PLACE AND PLAYING THE FIRST SONG ON THE USB STICK AFTER RESTARTING THE VEHICLE USING THE VOICE COMMANDS WITH USB IS FAIRLY USELESS YOU CANNOT SAY PLAY ALL AND HAVE IT PLAY EVERYTH 
THE USB JACKS NEED A BETTER AMPLIFIER MUSIC FROM MY MP3 PLAYER IS LACKING VOLUME AND A QUALITY SOUND THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOESN T PICK UP MY VOICE VERY WELL I HAVE TO SPEAK VERY LOUDLY IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK AND SOMETIMES THAT WON 
THE USB MULTI MEDIA PLAYER FOLDER LIST IS IMPOSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING THE SOUND VOLUME IS TOO LOW WHILE USING THE BLUETOOTH UCONNECT
THE USB OUTLET DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH MY GALAXY PHONE 
THE USB PLAYER IS NOT AS RESPONSIVE AS IT COULD BE THE SONGS ARE DIFFICULT TO BROWSE AND IT FORGETS THE POSITION OF THE LAST SONG SOMETIMES
THE USB PORT
THE USB PORT AREA IS HARD TO OPERATE IF YOUR DRIVING LIKE UNPLUGGING YOUR CELL OR JUST REACHING YOUR CELL PHONE IN THAT AREA IS RATHER HARD 
THE USB PORT BEING IN A SMALLER MODEL WITH LESS EXCESSIVE FEATURES THAN IN LUXURY VEHICLES I WOULD APPRECIATE THE REMOVAL OF THE SATELLITE RADIO 
THE USB PORT CONNECTION FOR MUSIC THROUGH PHONE IS NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT WHY WERE THE STEERING WHEEL AUDIO & STATION CONTROLS SWITCHED?
THE USB PORT CUTS OFF AFTER YOU RESTART THE CAR SO YOU NEED TO RESET IT BACK FROM THE RADIO THAT TAKES TIME AND IT SUCKS
THE USB PORT DID NOT RECOGNIZE MY MP3 PLAYER SO I HAD TO USE A STANDARD AUDIO CABLE TO CONNECT IT IT DOES NOT WORK AS SMOOTHLY BECAUSE WITHOUT THE USB CONNECTION I CAN NOT FORWARD SONGS WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS 
THE USB PORT DOESN T APPEAR TO ACTUALLY CHARGE USB DEVICES WHEN PLUGGED IN IT MAY ONLY BE TO INTERFACE WITH AN IPOD WHICH I DON T OWN 
THE USB PORT DOESN T CONNECT SOMETIMES IT CONNECTS AND DISCONNECTS OVER AND OVER 
THE USB PORT FOR THE IPOD IS HARD TO REACH PLUS I HAVE OLD IPODS AND THE SYSTEM OFFERS LIMITED NAVIGATION OF THE DEVICES 
THE USB PORT I HAD TO SWITCH TO AUX 
THE USB PORT IS A LITTLE HARD TO GET TO IN THAT DRAWER ONCE YOU GET IT IN THERE IT IS FINE BUT IT SEEMS THAT YOU WOULD PUT THAT USB PORT IN A LITTLE BIT EASIER PLACE TO ACCESS
THE USB PORT IS AN EXTREMELY USEFUL TOOL I LIKE BEING ABLE TO PLUG IN A USB DIVE WITH MY MUSIC SEPARATED INTO DIFFERENT FILES AND PLAY THEM RANDOMLY EITHER WITHIN THE FILE OR BETWEEN FILES 
THE USB PORT IS BURIED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CONSOLE WHICH BY ITSELF IS LOCATED TOO FAR BACK FOR THE DRIVER TO USE AT ALL WHILE DRIVING 
THE USB PORT IS LOCATED IN THE CENTER CONSOLE AND DIFFICULT TO ACCESS IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE FRONT PANEL 
THE USB PORT LIKE THE MOST I CAN PLAY MY FAVORITE RECORD MUSIC FROM IT 
THE USB PORT SHOULD FUNCTION BETTER AT TIMES THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY DOES NOT FUNCTION AUTOMATICALLY THERE IS A NEED TO MAKE SELECTIONS ON MY PHONE IF DESIRED 
THE USB PORT THAT ACCEPT A SIMPLE USB THUMB DRIVE TO LISTEN TO MY OWN MUSIC THOUSANDS OF FOLDERS MY OWN PERSONAL JUKEBOX IN MY OWN CAR SINCE I BOUGHT THIS CAR MY USB DRIVE NEVER LEAVE THE USB PORT BESIDE THE FM/AM RADIO FOR TRAFFIC INFO AND OT 
THE USB PORT TO CONNECT MY IPOD 
THE USB PORT WILL ONLY PLAY MP3 FORMATTED MUSIC FROM A MEMORY STICK THIS IS LIMITING I WISH IT COULD PLAY OTHER MORE MODERN AND HIGHER QUALITY FORMATS SUCH AAU OR WMA OR EVEN UNCOMPRESSED WAV MUSIC 
THE USB PORTS AND POWER PLUG AND NAV CARD PORT NEED TO COME OUT OF CENTER CONSOLE TAKES UP ROOM COULD BE PUT ON DASH LIKE SOME FORD CARS AND TRUCKS
THE USB/AUX PORT DIFFICULT TO USE ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING BLUETOOTH TO SMART PHONES SHOULD BE STANDARD AND NOT AN OPTION 
THE USE OF FOG LIGHTS ON DARK ROADS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR THE OLDER DRIVER I M ONE PERHAPS A STRONGER FOG LAMP COULD BE INCLUDED A TURNING PACKAGE FOR LIGHTS WOULD ALSO HELP 
THE USE OF HANDS FREE CALLING AND RECEIVING CALLS 
THE USE OF HEADPHONES WHERE THE PERSON WATCHING THE MOVIE CAN LISTEN TO THE MOVIE AND THE REST OF THE PASSENGERS CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC OR RADIO 
THE USE OF PHONE SERVICE WITHOUT TAKING HANDS OF WHEEL A TRUE SAFETY MEASURE!! I DO NOT LIKE TO BE INTERUPTED DURING DRIVING THUS I DO NOT USE PHONE SERVICES UNLESS I REALLY HAVE TOO 
THE USE OF THE COMAND KNOB TO EASILY SCROLL AND MAKE SELECTIONS THIS SYSTEM FEATURE IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL AND FAR SUPERIOR AND SAFER TO USE WHILE DRIVING THAN TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS 
THE USE OF THE FOUR FOG LAMPS REALLY LIGHTS UP A WIDE AREA WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT THIS IS PARTICULARLY GOOD WHEN IN A AREA WITH LOTS OF DEER CROSSING THE ROAD 
THE USE OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION PROGRAMING FOR THE NAVIGATION IS NOT RELIABLE THE HK RADIO IS ONLY AVERAGE IN TERMS OF SOUND QUALITY
THE USE OF THIS IS NOT USER FRIENDLY I FIND IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO USE AND PROGRAM A STATION I PROGRAM IT AND GO TO USE IT IT S LOST I M NOT THE ONLY PERSON THAT TRIED THIS I HAD 2 CO WORKERS EXPERIENCE THE SAME ISSUE WITH MY CAR
THE USER EXPERIENCE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT SPECIFICALLY THE TIMING OF SWITCHING FROM BACK UP CAMERA TO THE NEW WARNING SCREEN AND THEN FINALLY TO THE ON SCREEN MENU THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW IN LOADING AND SWITCHING SCRE 
THE USER FRIENDLINESS OF ALL THE TECH IS TOP RATED FOR ME EASE OF USE TO WHERE A CHILD CAN GET IT IS GREAT FOR ME 
THE USER FRIENDLY DEVICE IS JUST WHAT I NEEDED SO EASY TO USE & IT IS VERY EASY TO READ & LOVE THE VOICE OF THE GPS ALSO LOVE THE RADIO 
THE USER INTERFACE IS POOR IT ADDS CONFUSION WITH HAVING THE STANDARD RADIO CONTROLS ALONG WITH THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE CONTROLS IT S TIME TO GET RID OF THE OLD CONTROLS AND USE THE SPACE FOR A LARGER DISPLAY THAT IS TOUCH SCREEN 
THE USER INTERFACE IT JUST IDIOTIC I COULD DESIGN A BETTER UI AND I DON T KNOW HOW TO CODE THE VOICE COMMAND IS A JOKE THE CONNECTED IPHONE APP STARLINK IS A WASTE OF EVERYONE S TIME IT DOES NOTHING RESPONSIVENESS OF THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM 
THE USER INTERFACE NEEDS TO BE FASTER AND MORE INTUITIVE
THE USER INTERFACE ON MAPS COULD BE IMPROVED TO SHOW THE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS LIST AS A DEFAULT INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH A SERIES OF STEPS TO ARRIVE THERE 
THE USER INTERFACE TO SYNC WITH APPS PANDORA 
THE USER MANUAL SHOULD BE ON AN I PAD LIKE ON HYUNDAI THE USER MANUAL THAT IS BUILT INTO THE COMAND SYSTEM IS QUITE USELESS ONE WOULD HAVE TO SPEND DAYS IN THE CAR READING THE DAMN THING 
THE UTILIZATION OF MY IPHONE ON BLUETOOTH IS PHENOMENAL AS I USE IT NOT ONLY FOR MY BUSINESS BUT PERSONALLY
THE V SHAPED DISTANCE BETWEEN AREA WHERE DASHBOARD MEETS THE FRONT WINDSHIELD COULD VE EITHER BEEN MINIMIZED OR RECONFIGURED TO BE EITHER MORE ROOM OR USABLE STORAGE 
THE VAN IS SURPRISINGLY WELL EQUIPPED FOR SUCH A LOW LEVEL TRIM THE L MODEL WE PARTICULARLY LIKE THE HANDS FREE TELEPHONE USE 
THE VARIABLE SPEED CONTROL OF THE WIPERS FROM LOW TO MAX THE CURRENT SYSTEM ON MAX DELAY DOES NOT MEASURE THE DELAY BY A TIME REFERENCE BUT SEEMS TO ADJUST THE SPEED DEPENDING UPON HOW MUCH PRECIPITATION IS COMING DOWN IF I WANTED IT TO BE ON 
THE VARIETY OF COURCES
THE VARIETY OF OPTIONS
THE VARIETY OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE
THE VARIETY OF STATIONS LATIN MUSIC CLASSIC RADIO STATION COUNTRY MUSIC JAZZ
THE VARIOUS SAFETY FEATURES ARE NICE TO HAVE 
THE VARIOUS VEHICLE S ELECTRONIC SAFETY FEATURES ARE SPECIALLY EFFECTIVE BUT NOT INTRUSIVE I WON T BUY A CAR WITHOUT THEM IN THE FUTURE

THE VEHICLE IS OUTSTANDING FOR SOMEONE MY HEIGHT 5 10 
THE VEHICLE IS SMALL WITH LOW HEIGHT ALTHOUGH I KNOW THE VEHICLE IS SAFE IT CAN FEEL INTIMIDATING WHEN NEAR OTHER LARGER TRUCKS OR SUVS 
THE VEHICLE IS STILL NEW TO ME AND I AM STILL LEARNING ALL FEATURES SO FAR I AM VERY PLEASED I MUST TELL YOU I HAD SOMEONE RUN A STOP SIGN IN FRONT OF ME AND THE BRAKES WORKED GREAT AND I WAS ABLE TO AVOID COLLISION

THE VEHICLE IS WELL DESIGNED ALLOWING FOR INCREASED VISIBILITY FRONT SIDE AND REAR THE ADDED SAFETY FEATURES CLOSE THE GAP ON ANY BLIND SPOTS 
THE VEHICLE NAVIGATION NEEDS SOME WORK TO MAKE EASIER TO USE AGAIN I FEEL THAT IT WAS MADE MORE COMPLICATED IN MY 2015 S5 VS MY 2012 A5 CANCELING THE NAVIGATION GUIDANCE WAS EASIER ENTERING AN ADDRESS WAS EASIER ETC USING THE VOICE COMMANDS 
THE VEHICLE NEEDS BETTER SOUNDING FACTORY SPEAKERS AND BETTER RADIO RECEPTION 
THE VEHICLE NEEDS FRONT AND REAR SENSORS TO AID IN PARKING BACKING ETC 
THE VEHICLE NEEDS MORE USB PORTS INSTEAD OF THREE 12V PORTS *A 110/115/120 V OUTLET IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE WOULD BE NICE TOO THE ROCKFORD FOSGATE SOUND SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING FOR A STOCK SYTEM BUT THE NAV COULD BE MUCH MORE ACCURATE WITH D 
THE VEHICLE NEEDS PRIVACY GLASS INSTALLED IN THE REAR WINDOW DUE TO VERY BLINDING FRFOM OTHER DRIVERS AT NIGHT I HAVE TO ALWAYS LOWER MY REAR VIEW MIRROR

THE VEHICLE SUPPORTS BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE DOORS CAUSE SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS I HAVE A CDL AND A BUS DRIVER ENDORSEMENT I UNDERSTAND SAFETY ISSUES THE SUPPORTS CAUSES ABOUT 3 MAJOR BLIND SPOTS ON EITHER SIDE FRONT SIDE REAR 
THE VEHICLE THE I TEST DROVE WAS FULLY LOADED WITH OPTIONAL SAFETY DEVICES SUCH AS LANE MONITORING AND BACKUP ASSISTANCE AND BLIND SPOT DETECTION THOSE OPTIONS WERE NOT OFFERED IN A VEHICLE OF THE COLOR THAT I TRULY LIKED SO I PURCHASED THE CAR 
THE VEHICLE TRULY NEEDS BLIND SPOT MONTORING
THE VEHICLE VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY IS ADEQUATE GIVEN MY UTILITARIAN PURPOSES AND THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE VEHICLE
THE VEHICLE WARNING SYSTEM IS A PLUS FOR ME IT HELPS ME TO REALLY FOCUS WHEN CHANGING LANES THE BACKUP CAMERA IS A GREAT SAFETY FEATURE 
THE VEHICLES BLIND SPOTS AREN T THAT GREAT AND HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING SOMETIMES WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE VEHICLES INTERNET CONNECTION SPEED IS UNACCEPTABLE IT IS SO SLOW AS TO BE UNUSABLE I AM VERY UPSET ABOUT IT

THE VEHICLES VISIBILITY IS ENHANCED BY THE ELECTRONIC BLIND SPOT DETECTORS FORWARD AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT 
THE VELOSTER HAS A RATHER FAT ARSE AND SMALL QUARTER PANEL WINDOWS WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OVER YOUR LEFT OR RIGHT SHOULDER WHILE BACKING UP SO I GUESS EVEN THOUGH IT IS A SMALL COMPACT CAR IT DOES HAVE SOME LARGER THAN NORMAL BLIND 
THE VERSATILITY ALTHOUGH I DO NOT YET USE ALL OF THE OPTIONS I KNOW I HAVE THEM RIGHT NOW I ENJOY THE SATELLITE RADIO AND THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY I SUSPECT THAT IN THE FUTURE AS I GET COMFORTABLE WITH THE CAR I WILL USE THESE SYSTEMS MORE 
THE VERSATILITY OF OPTIONS
THE VERY BOTTOM ABOUT 1 5 INCHES OF THE WINDSHIELD HAS A DISTORTED VIEW IT IS MOST NOTICEABLE WHEN USING THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE THE SAFETY OF SOLID CONSTRUCTION THE FRONT DOOR FRAMES ARE A LITTLE WIDE REDUCING VISIBILITY 
THE VERY GOOD SOUND IT MAKES
THE VERY SMALL REAR SIDE WINDOW WAS SKILLFULLY DESIGNED TO STILL BE USEFUL
THE VERY SOUND OF THE BOSE SYSTEM 
THE VIBRATING SEAT WARNINGS WAS A GREAT IDEA!
THE VIDEO SCREEN IS HARD TO SEE WHEN THE ROOF PANEL IS OFF AND IT IS SUNNY OUT GLARE AN ANTI GLARE SCREEN WOULD BE USEFULL
THE VIEW FROM DRIVERS SEAT COULD BE MORE EFFECIENT
THE VIEW FROM THE DRIVER S LEFT SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES LEFT IS ABYSMAL ALSO THE FACTORY INSTALLED TINT IS TOO DARK FOR NIGHT TIME CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT 
THE VIEW FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT A LITTLE LOW THE SEAT DOES NOT RAISE IT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GAUGE THE POSITION OF THE HOOD OF THE VEHICLE AS IT IS SLIGHTLY OBSCURED DUE TO THE LOW SEAT POSITION
THE VIEW FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT IS EXCEPTIONAL NOT ONLY THAT BUT MY WIFE WHO USUALLY GETS MOTION SICK AS A PASSENGER DOES NOT IN THIS VEHICLE 
THE VIEW FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS SMALL
THE VIEW IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR IS OBSCURED BY THE ANTI WHIPLASH HEAD SUPPORTS
THE VIEW OF VEHICLES BEHIND YOU IN TRAFFIC IS NOT GOOD THE ANGLE OF THE MIRROR THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW IS NOT SHARP ENOUGH YOU CANNOT SEE CARS THAT ARE CLOSE BEHIND YOU 
THE VIEW ON THE NAV SYSTEM IS AWFUL THE ABILITY TO NARROW IN AND OUT OF MAP IS NOT VERY GOOD 
THE VIEW OUT THE BACK WINDOW SEEMS NARROW BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE OF THE REAR OF THE CAR AND THE TRUNK SPACE I AM GETTING USED TO IT COMPARED TO WHAT I HAD BEFORE FOR 12 YEARS I FEEL I CAN EASILY TURN AND LOOK BEHIND TO 
THE VIEWING SCREEN IS AN ACCEPTABLE AND PRACTICAL SIZE
THE VISIBILITY ALL ROUND THE VEHICLE WHEN DRIVING HAS DECREASED FROM LAST MODEL 2013 
THE VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY IS HINDERED WHILE TRAVELING AT SPEEDS OF 70 MPH AND THE SECOND TRANSMISSION STARTS TO GO OUT TRUE STORY BY THE WAY
THE VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY OF THE Q3 IS EXCEPTION WITH A HIGHER RIDING POSITION AND LARGE ENOUGH WINDOWS THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLE VISIBILITY IS GREAT WITH THE SIDE ASSIST AND REAR VIEW CAMERA WITH BACKUP AND PARKING SENSORS IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE VISIBILITY AND ESPECIALLY THE TILT OF THE WINDSHIELD ARE OPTIMAL 
THE VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS OR OTHERWISE USING SIDEVISION IS NOT VERY EASY THERE SEEM TO BE BLIND SPOTS THE WINDSHIELD AND DOOR POSTS MAKE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS OVERALL I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE 
THE VISIBILITY AT MOST TIMES A GOOD FOR ITS SIZE
THE VISIBILITY AT THE RIGHT REAR CORNER IS VERY LIMITED! THIS CAUSES SOME BLIND SPOTS WHILE CHANGING LANE 
THE VISIBILITY FOR CHANGING LANES IS BAD THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER REAR SIDE THIS IS MITIGATED BY THE LANE CHANGING SENSOR BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CHECK BEFORE YOU CAN CHANGE LANES IF YOU NEED TO 
THE VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT IS NOT GOOD WHEN VISOR IS PULLED DOWN IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO CHECK YOUR BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE VISIBILITY FROM INSIDE THE LR4 IS AMAZING YOU DON T REALIZE HOW MUCH IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE UNTIL YOU DRIVE ANOTHER VEHICLE AFTERWARDS 
THE VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT IS THE ABSOLUTE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE IN A VEHICLE FOR ME THE 2015 PRIUSV VISIBILITY IS A MARKED IMPROVEMENT OVER PREVIOUS PRIUS VEHICLES WE HAVE A 2013 PRIUS AND I DO NOT LIKE DRIVING IT BECAUSE OF ITS 
THE VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER SEAT ON THE LEFT SIDE/BACK IS DIFFICULT WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT I CAN EASILY SEE BEHIND CENTRAL AND BEHIND TO THE RIGHT BUT HAVE LIMITED VIEW BEHIND TO THE LEFT 
THE VISIBILITY FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS MISLEADING SOMETHING TO GET USE TO 
THE VISIBILITY FROM WITHIN THE VEHICLE ON ALL SIDES IS GREAT THE THE BARS AROUND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT HOWEVER SOMETIMES CAN BLOCK SEEING PEDESTRIANS OR BIKE RIDERS WOULD BE NICE IF THEY WERE NARROWER 
THE VISIBILITY IN BLIND SPOT IS THE SAME ON ALL THESE MODELS A LITTLE HARD BUT NOT A PROBLEM THE LITTLE EXTRA MIRRORS ATTACHED TO SIDE MIRRORS ARE A BIG IMPROVEMENT TO THIS ISSUE 
THE VISIBILITY IN MY ACURA ILX IS GREAT 
THE VISIBILITY IN THIS CAR IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE BLIND SPOT MY ONLY COMPLAINT IN THIS SECTION IS THE SUN VISORS DO NOT EXTENT OUT SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE SUN IS ON MY SIDE AND I MOVE THE VISOR TO MY SIDE I CANT EXTEND IT FU 
THE VISIBILITY IN THIS VEHICLE IS MUCH REDUCED FROM THE FORD ESCAPE I DROVE FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS VISIBILITY MAY BE IMPROVED BY INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE BACK WINDOWS AND REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE BULKY FRAME 
THE VISIBILITY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO US AND DISCOUNTED MANY VEHICLES WE TESTED THE XC60 HAS EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY FOR THE DRIVER 
THE VISIBILITY IS AVERAGE BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT SAFER IN A CAR IT FEELS SAFE EVEN IN SNOW 
THE VISIBILITY IS BETTER IN THE LEGACY THAN IN SOME OTHER SEDANS 
THE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT 
THE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT THE CAR FEELS VERY OPEN AND SPACIOUS THE PANORAMIC SUNROOF IS A NICE PLUS TO THIS 
THE VISIBILITY IS FANTASTIC THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS HUGE AND EASY TO SEE OUT OF 
THE VISIBILITY IS FINE AND THE SIDE RADAR DETECTOR IS AWESOME 
THE VISIBILITY IS GOOD FOR THE SIZE OF VEHICLE IT IS JUST SOMETHING I NEED TO GET USED TO 
THE VISIBILITY IS GOOD HAD AN EVENT WHERE I FORGOT TO TURN ON MY LIGHTS AT NIGHT AND COULD STILL SEE THE HIGHWAY WITH NO PROBLEM
THE VISIBILITY IS GOOD HAVING BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS VERY HELPFUL IN CHANGING LANES IT SHOULD BE STANDARD IN ALL CARS IT ALSO HAS REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT WHICH IS GREAT IN PARKING LOTS ALL WHEEL DRIVE IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FEATURE TO HAVE 
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT 
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT AND THE DRIVING IS ASSURING KNOWING IT HAS SO MANY SAFETY FEATURES
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT FROM ALL ANGLES!
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT I DON T WORRY ABOUT BLIND SPOTS ETC FURTHERMORE I HAVE NEVER HAD A VEHICLE BEFORE WHERE THE SUN VISORS WERE USEFUL SINCE I M A BIT SHORT BUT IN THE SANTA FE THEY ACTUALLY WORK FOR ME AND HONESTLY I M GRATEFUL FOR THAT 
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT ON THIS CAR I LOVE THE LITTLE MIRROR WITHIN THE MIRROR 
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT WHILE DRIVING BUT ONLY WHEN THE TRANSMISSION WORKS THEN YOUR NOT DRIVING IT
THE VISIBILITY IS MORE THAN OUTSTANDING AND THE BACK UP CAMERA WITH FRONT AND REAR SENSORS SIMPLIFY PARKING IN A TIGHT GARAGE AS WELL AS ON THE STREET THE ABILITY TO SEE EVERYTHING IS MORE THAN I COULD HAVE HOPED FOR THE POWER AND BREAKING 
THE VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING FOR THE DRIVER WHEN I M THE PASSENGER THERE IS LIMITED SEAT ADJUSTMENTS SO IT MAKES VISIBILITY DIFFICULT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE 
THE VISIBILITY IS QUITE GOOD FOR A COUPE AND THAT S JUST A DECISION THE DESIGN IS QUITE GOOD AND SAFETY FEATURES IMPROVE THE VISIBILITY GREATLY 
THE VISIBILITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE HIGHLANDER I HAD THE SAVING GRACE IS THE ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU REALLY CANNOT SEE AROUND THE CAR WELL 
THE VISIBILITY IS SURPRISINGLY GOOD AND WHERE THERE IS A BLINDSPOT THEY MAKE UP FOR IT WITH DETECTION TOOLS 
THE VISIBILITY IS THE BEST I VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN A VEHICLE 
THE VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD
THE VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SEATS ADJUST TO GIVE YOU WHATEVER PERSPECTIVE YOU WANT I LIKE MY SEAT HIGH SO I CAN SEE ALL AROUND AND THE ENCORE ALLOWS THIS IT S A VERY APPEALING ASPECT 
THE VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD EXCEPT FOR THE USUAL BLIND SPOTS 
THE VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD EXCEPT FOR THE USUAL BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES 
THE VISIBILITY IS WHAT SOLD ME ON THIS CAR I WAS LOOKING AT SUV S OF ALL BRANDS BUT THE VISIBILITY OF THE NEW ONES ARE HORRIBLE SO I WENT WITH THE MIRAGE 
THE VISIBILITY ISN T THAT GOOD WHILE BACKING UP INTO A DRIVEWAY I DON T KNOW IF THIS MEANS THE WINDOWS ARE TOO SMALL OR THE VEHICLE IS TOO HIGH 
THE VISIBILITY ISSUE IS A HUGE CONCERN I DON T KNOW IF IT IS JUST MY SEAT POSITION BUT EVERY SUPPORT BEAM IS IN THE WAY OF SEEING SIDE TRAFFIC SO THE EARLY DETECTION IS A MUST BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT IS A CRAP SHOOT IF I WILL BE SWIPED B 
THE VISIBILITY OF THE 15 WRX IS MUCH HIGHER THEN THE 13 THE SMALL WINDOW NEAR THE SIDE MIRRORS HELP WITH SHARP TURNS IN PARKING LOTS AND SAME GOES WITH THE SMALL REAR ONES HELPS WITH LANE CHANGES THE CAR IS SOLID BUT NOT HARSH THE ONLY THING 
THE VISIBILITY OF THE BACKUP CAMERA IS VERY POOR ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT VERY FOGGY YES WE VE WIPED THE CAMERA LENS 
THE VISIBILITY OF THE DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT WHENEVER I AM CHANGING LANES ON THE DRIVER SIDE THERE IS A HORRIBLE BLIND SPOT 
THE VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING IS GREAT
THE VISIBILITY OF THE SUBARU FORESTER IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL AS IS THE SAFETY OF THE CAR THESE ARE TWO OF THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT LEAD ME TO PURCHASE THIS CAR 
THE VISIBILITY OF THE VEHICLES HEADLIGHT SYSTEM FOR NIGHT DRIVING IS EXCEPTIONAL 
THE VISIBILITY OF THE WINDOW CONFIGURATION ELIMINATES BLIND SPOTS
THE VISIBILITY OF THIS CAR IS PROBABLY THE POOREST I VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN A VEHICLE THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS BLOCK QUITE A BIT OF THE REAR WINDOW THE FRONT WINDOW IS EITHER SMALL OR SLANTED SO THAT VISIBILITY IS HINDERED LOOKING TO SEE IF SOME 
THE VISIBILITY OF THIS VEHICLE ALL AROUND I FEEL IS VERY GOOD 
THE VISIBILITY ON THE LEFT SIDE AND REAR ARE LIMITED
THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE FRONT LEFT FIELD OF VISION FOR THE DRIVER ISN T AS GREAT DUE TO THE BAR ABOVE THE SMALL WINDOW SOMETHING TO GET USED TO 
THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE PASSENGER WINDOW IS NOT VERY GOOD THE SEATBELT SUPPORT OR WHAT EVER IT IS CALLED IS VERY WIDE AND HARD TO SEE TRAFFIC COMING FROM THAT SIDE ALMOST LIKE A LARGE BLIND SPOT WHEN STOPPED AND SOMEONE IS COMING TOWARDS YOU 
THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE SIDE AND REAR WINDOWS IS PRETTY BAD BUT THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A SPORTS CAR 
THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE SIDES AND BACK OF THE VEHICLE IS NOT GREAT BUT THE ELECTRONIC SENSORS MAKE IT EXTREMELY EASY TO KNOW WHAT S AROUND THE VEHICLE 
THE VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR VIEW WINDOW IS NOT AS GOOD AS I WOULD LIKE 
THE VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDO COULD BE MUCH BETTER AND THE WIPERS COULD COVER MORE WINDOW TERRITORY 
THE VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS HINDERED THE WINDOW AREA COULD BE LARGER AND THE HEADRESTS INTERFERE WITH SIGHT THE OVERHEAD REAR WINDOW WIPER DOES NOT CLEAR ENOUGH AREA THE UNDER THE WINDOW MOUNTED WIPER CLEARS A LARGER AREA 
THE VISIBILITY OVERALL IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER VEHICLES IN THIS CLASS THAT I HAVE DRIVEN 
THE VISIBILITY SEEING FORWARD AND THE HEADLIGHTS MAKE IT GREAT TO SEE IN ALL CONDITIONS EVEN AT NIGHT IN THE RAIN 
THE VISIBILITY SIDE AND REAR IS GENERALLY TERRIBLE � BUT THE CAR IS SO FAST THAT THERE S RARELY SOMEONE IN MY BLIND SPOT 
THE VISIBILITY THROUGH INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW IS TERRIBLE CONVERTIBLE 
THE VISIBILITY THROUGH THE BACK UP CAMERA IS POOR ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT 
THE VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REAR TAILGATE WINDOW IS DIFFICULT THE WINDOW IS TOO SMALL THE HEIGHT OF THE THIRD SEAT ALSO TAKES AWAY FROM THE EASE OF VISIBILITY 
THE VISIBILITY TO THE SIDES AND REAR MUST BE IMPROVED THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS A START BUT NOT THE SOLUTION WHEN YOU BACK UP YOU CAN SEE THE IMMEDIATE REAR OF YOUR VEHICLE HOWEVER THE 45 DEGREE ANGLES TO THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE ARE BLIND T 
THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES AND IN REAR IS NOT THE BEST QUALITY 
THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES AND REVERSING IS EXCELLENT FOR A 2 DOOR COUPE STYLE 
THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS FANTASTIC AND THE HEADLIGHT BEAMS ARE BEYOND AMAZING
THE VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING FOR THE LEFT BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY PREVIOUS CAR THE PANEL BETWEEN FRONT DOOR & BACK DOOR COULD BE MADE NARROWER SOMEHOW TO PROVIDE MORE WINDOW/VISIBILITY SPACE 
THE VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING IS POOR BECAUSE OF THE WIDE SIDE AREAS TO THE SIDES OF THE WINDSHIELD I AM USED TO A GREATER AMOUNT OF FORWARD/SIDE VISIBILITY 
THE VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING MY NEW GMC SIERRA HD GET BETTER AND BETTER AS I DRIVE IT IT IS AN ADJUSTMENT FROM THE OTHER VEHICLE THAT I DROVE PREVIOUSLY 
THE VISOR ANGLE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE SEEMS A BIT OFF SOMETIMES SEEMS TO IMPAIR MY VIEW OUT REAR VIEW MIRROR AND DOESN T SEEM BIG ENOUGH FOR ADEQUATE SUN PROTECTION ON SIDE
THE VISOR COULD BE WIDER OR HAVE A SLIDE OUT TO HELP BLOCK ADDITIONAL WINDOW AREA 
THE VISOR DOESN T COVER THE ENTIRETY OF THE DRIVER S WINDOW WHEN MOVING THE VISOR TO THE DRIVER S LEFT SIDE IT IS DISTRACTING 
THE VISOR DOESN T DO ENOUGH IF YOU MOVE IT FROM THE FRONT WINDOW TO THE SIDE WINDOW IT S TOO SMALL MY MERCEDES HAD TWO VISORS ONE FOR THE FRONT WINDOW AND ONE FOR THE SIDE WHICH WORKED REALLY WELL 
THE VISOR EXTENDING SHOULD BE THE SME LEVEL AS THE VISOR
THE VISOR IS COVERED WITH A FELT MATERIAL OVER TIME OPERATING THE VISOR IS GOING TO SHOW SOIL ON THIS ABSORBENT MATERIAL THE VISORS OR AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE EDGE SHOULD HAVE A LEATHER OR VINYL COVERING 
THE VISOR IS HARD TO REACH AND MOVE WHILE DRIVING
THE VISOR IS INEFFECTIVE TO THE SIDE 
THE VISOR IS OK IN FRONT MODE BUT SIDE MODE IS COMPLETELY USELESS 
THE VISOR IS TOO SHORT FOR ME 
THE VISOR IS TOO SHORT WHEN TURNING IT TOWARDS THE WINDOW THE SUN IS STILL ON THE SIDE OF MY FACE 
THE VISOR MIRROR IS SMALLER THAN WHAT I HAD IN A 2010 CADILLAC AND THE LIGHTING COULD BE BETTER 
THE VISOR S ARE TOO SMALL IT DOES NOT BLOCK THE SUN FALLING ON THE ENTIRE WINDOW 
THE VISORS ARE ALMOST USELESS SINCE THEY ARE NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO COVER SUN OR OTHER BRIGHT LIGHT THEY ALSO DO NOT SWING TOWARD THE SIDE WINDOWS 
THE VISORS ARE DIFFICULT TO SHIFT FROM FRONT TO SIDE WHEN IN DOWN POSITION IN ADDITION THE SCREENS IN THE 2 ND ROW HAVE SCREENS AND THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL FOR THE DRIER AND FRONT PASSENGER FOR SUN SCREENING 
THE VISORS ARE FIXED
THE VISORS ARE GREAT BUT WHAT MAKES IT BETTER IS THE FACT THAT I CAN RAISE MY SEAT I AM SHORT AND RAISING THE SEAT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD
THE VISORS ARE KIND OF TINY/INEFFECTIVE
THE VISORS ARE LARGE AND HARD TO PUT BACK WITHOUT HITTING MY HEAD
THE VISORS ARE MUCH BETTER WITH THE EXTENSION ADDITION 
THE VISORS ARE NOT LONG ENOUGH SO THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO BLOCK THE SUN ON THE WINDOW THEY DON T PULL OVER FAR ENOUGH ALSO YOU ARE VERY DEPENDENT ON YOUR MIRRORS WHEN CHANGING LANES AND IT S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO TELL AT NIGHT WHERE ANOTHER CA 
THE VISORS ARE NOT LOW ENOUGH AND I CAN T BRING THE SEAT TOO HIGH OR IT FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE
THE VISORS ARE PLACED PERFECTLY THAT I CAN ACTUALLY USE THEM NOW AND NO SUN GLARES OR BLINDSPOT FROM CORNER OF WINDSHIELD AND SIDE OF CAR 
THE VISORS ARE REALLY TOO SMALL BUT UNDERSTAND IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST IT COULD BE FOR THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE THE REAR VISIBILITY IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE VEHICLE IS MADE I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I AM POSITIONED PROPERLY TO VIEW 
THE VISORS ARE SMALL
THE VISORS ARE SMALL IT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO HAVE THEM EXTEND OUT LIKE THE KIA SOUL 
THE VISORS ARE TERRIBLE NO EXTENSION NO SLIDE ON EITHER DRIVER OR PASSENGER IT IS TOO SMALL TO BE USEFUL TO THE SIDE 
THE VISORS ARE TOO LARGE I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR BLOCKING THE SUN HOWEVER THEY ARE CUMBERSOME AND IT IS HARD TO USE THE VISOR MIRROR AT MY HEIGHT 5 3 
THE VISORS ARE TOO SHORT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM I ALSO WISH THEY HAD SLIDING EXTENDERS I HAD THEM ON MY PREVIOUS CHEVROLET AND REALLY FOUND THEM USEFUL 
THE VISORS ARE TOO SHORT SHOULD BE MADE LONGER TO HELP SHADE THE SUN
THE VISORS ARE TOO SHORT TO BLOCK ANY SUNLIGHT ALSO THE BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES ARE REALLY BAD 
THE VISORS ARE TOO SHORT WHEN MOVED TO THE DOOR WINDOW
THE VISORS ARE TOO SMALL
THE VISORS ARE TOO SMALL AND POORLY CONSTRUCTED 
THE VISORS ARE VERY SMALL AND DONT MANEUVER WELL 
THE VISORS ARE VERY SMALL THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT IS PROBABLY WHAT IS MY LEAST FAVORITE OF ALL ASPECTS OF THIS VEHICLE THERE IS ONLY A SMALL SLICE IT SEEMS TO BE SEEN WHEN LOOKING THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I OFTEN USE 
THE VISORS CAN BLOCK ENTIRE VIEW 
THE VISORS COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER AND ON THE SIDE VIEW THEY SHOULD EXPAND A LITTLE
THE VISORS COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER 
THE VISORS COULD BE A TOUCH LONGER IN BOTH WIDTH & LENGTH 
THE VISORS COULD BE BIGGER TO BLOCK THE SUN
THE VISORS COULD BE REDESIGNED TO COVER THE BLIND SPOT BY THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THE VISORS DO NOT BLOCK THE SUN IN THE OUTER CORNERS WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING AT THE SUN ENTERS THE VEHICLE AT THAT ANGLE IT CAN BE BLINDING 
THE VISORS DO NOT COVER ENOUGH HORIZONTALLY
THE VISORS DO NOT COVER MUCH OF THE SUN THE WIPERS DONT GET ALL OF THE RAIN
THE VISORS DON T KEEP OUT THE SUN
THE VISORS NEED EXTENSIONS 
THE VISORS NEED TO BE LONGER SUN STILL REMAINED IN EYES WHEN VISOR IS ACROSS DRIVER SIDE WINDOW 
THE VISORS NEED TO BE LONGER THEY DO NOT BLOCK THE SUN 
THE VISORS NEED TO HAVE AN EXTENSION ADDED TO THEM TO IMPROVE BLOCKING THE SUN 
THE VISORS NEED TO HAVE THE EXTENDABLE CAPABILITY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO MANIPULATE IT BETTER TO BLOCK SUN 
THE VISORS SEEM TO BE A LITTLE SMALL
THE VISORS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO SLIDE HORIZONTALLY TO PREVENT SUN FROM DISTRACTING AND OBSTRUCTING VIEW WE ARE QUITE SHOCKED THAT IN A 2015 VEHICLE FROM CHEVROLET THAT THIS FEATURE IS NOT HERE ****IT ACTUALLY IS A SAFETY FEATURE THAT SH 
THE VISORS SHOULD SLIDE ALONG THE RAIL SO IT CAN BE POSITIONED TO BLOCK THE SUN MORE EFFECTIVELY ONE HONDA WE HAD FEATURED THAT AND WE FOUND IT VERY USEFUL CANNOT BELIEVE IT IS NOT STANDARD
THE VISORS SHOULD SLIDE SO THAT I CAN BETTER BLOCK THE SUN WHEN IT IS LOW ON THE HORIZON 
THE VISORS SHOULD SWIVEL TO THE SIDE I KNOW I HAVE A BASIC CAR BUT THE SUN BLINDING BE FROM A SIDE VANTAGE 
THE VISUAL APPEAL OF THE VEHICLE IS STELLAR
THE VISUAL ASPECT
THE VISUAL DISPLAY AND DETAIL ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS FANTASTIC 
THE VISUAL DISPLAY IS DIFFICULT TO USE NOT INTUITIVE
THE VOICE ACCESS SYSTEM OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM

THE VOICE ACTIVATED AND HANDS FREE 
THE VOICE ACTIVATED COMMAND DOESN T SEEM TO PICK UP MY VOICE WELL 
THE VOICE ACTIVATED COMMANDS SHOULD BE LISTED ON A QUICK TIP GUIDE THAT CAN BE EASILY ACCESSED BY THE DRIVER BUTTON LABELS SHOULD ALIGN BETTER TO VOICE COMMANDS 
THE VOICE ACTIVATED CONTROLS ARE COMPLICATED TO USE AND NOT AS INTUITIVE AS THOSE ON OUR OTHER VEHICLE A FORD THEY REQUIRE TOO MUCH READING OF THE SCREEN WHILE DRIVING IF YOU ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CONTROLS
THE VOICE ACTIVATED FEATURE IS A BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER BY PREVIOUS 3SERIES 
THE VOICE ACTIVATED FEATURES NEVER WORK THE SYSTEM CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE ASKING IT TO DO

THE VOICE COMMAND BUTTON IS NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE WHEN DRIVING WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WAS LOCATED ON THE STEERING WHEEL OR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE OF RADIO
THE VOICE COMMAND DOES NOT WORK IN THE VEHICLE WHICH IS STUPID WHY IS IT INSTALLED IF IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK?
THE VOICE COMMAND FEATURES CAN BE FRUSTRATING AS THEY DO NOT USUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR ARE SAYING TYPING IN THE COMMANDS TAKE LONGER AND IS MORE FRUSTRATING YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOCATE THE ONLY AIRPORT IN A 50 MILE RADIUS BUT IT CANT

THE VOICE COMMANDS ARE MUCH BETTER IN THIS VEHICLE THAN MY LAST HOWEVER I AM NOT A HUGE FAN OF HD RADIO I FEEL LIKE IT CUTS IN AND OUT A BIT AS IT IS TRYING TO GET THE SIGNAL 
THE VOICE COMMANDS ARE NO GOOD DOESN T RECOGNIZE VOICES WELL AT ALL

THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENT I DON T LIKE HAVING TO REPEAT A NAME WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A CALL 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOES NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND ME 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOES NOT EVER UNDERSTAND WHAT I WANT EVEN WITH THE SIMPLEST OF COMMANDS SUCH AS CALL HOME

THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR THE RADIO IS FRUSTRATING AND DIFFICULT TO USE 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM FREQUENTLY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE COMMANDS 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAS TOO MANY STEPS!! TO MAKE A CALL SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY CALL RICK AND SYSTEM SHOULD DO IT/UNDERSTAND IT SHOULD NOT TAKE 5 COMMANDS TO HAVE TO MAKE A PHONE CALL 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAS TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING WHAT I AM SAYING SOME TIMES 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAS YET TO PLACE A CALL COMMAND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LACK THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY PLACES BY BUSINESS NAME SUCH AS TRADER JOES ANN ARBOR MICHIGAN EITHER SCROLLING THROUGH MULTIPLE LISTS OR LOOKING UP A STREET AD 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS A WASTE OF TIME TO USE AS A RESULT I USE MY PHONE FOR NAV AND PHONE CALLS 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE IT IS LESS INTUITIVE THAN THE ONE I HAD IN MY NISSAN MURANO
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT AND VERY EASY TO USE 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS FAR INFERIOR TO MY OLD CAR MY FORD EXPLORER HAD AN EXCELLENT VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS GARBAGE IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND HALF OF WHAT I SAY NO MATTER HOW I SAY IT I HAVE BEEN USING VOICE SYSTEMS FOR YEARS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST I WISH I COULD BYPASS IT AND USE MY PHONE TO CONTROL THE CAR MAYBE I 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS HORRENDOUS I HAVE YET TO GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS NOT INTUITIVE AND THE HELP MENU ISN T VERY HELPFUL I AVOID USING IT BECAUSE I DON T WANT TO BE FRUSTRATED 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS NOT INTUITIVE THE SYSTEM REQUIRES YOU TO KNOW THE VOICE RECOGNITION TAGS IN ORDER TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE MOST PART THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS USELESS 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS NOT THE BEST EVEN AFTER CALIBRATION I WISH I COULD USE APPS IN MY TOYOTA THE SPEAKERS ARE OK NOT GREAT AND NOT TERRIBLE JUST OK 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS PRETTY BAD ALSO THE VOLVO ON CALL APP LOCKS DOORS REMOTE START STINKS TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS QUITE BAD IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE OUR INPUT WE HAVE A NEUTRAL ACCENT IT NEVER SEEMS TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY ADDRESSES OR EVEN CITIES/STATES IT S SO BAD THAT WE DON T USE IT ANY MORE VOICE RECOGNITION MY 2008 ACUR 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS TERRIFIC FOR USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS VERY EASY TO USE AND DOESN T HAVE TO BE TRAINED ANYONE WHO USES THE VEHICLE IT WILL WORK FOR AND THE VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION IS VERY EASY TO USE WHILE DRIVING WHICH IS REALLY HELPFUL WHEN YOU NEED TO BE HANDS FREE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO ME ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO THE RADIO CD AND AUX COMMANDS I ALSO DON T LIKE THAT I HAVE TO TELL IT TO GO TO THE NEXT CD INSTEAD OF PLAYING THE SAME ONE OVER AND OVER I LISTEN TO BOOKS ON CD A 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM MAKES THIS AREA DIFFICULT TO RATE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT IN MY OPINION IT COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE TO USE AND DO A BETTER JOB OF RECOGNIZING VERBAL COMMANDS OR INSTRUCTIONS I USE GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE FOR NAVIGATION DUE TO THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES T 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT IT SIMPLY CAN T COMPREHEND SIMPLE WORDS THAT I USE OFTEN WHEN TRYING TO MAKE HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS SUE AND MOM MY SECONDARY FRUSTRATION IS THE USE OF THE SIRIUS IT S SIMPLE TO GET TO SIR 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS SOME SERIOUS WORK! THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ARE OUTSTANDING AS ARE THE INTERFACES WITH EXTERNAL UNITS SMARTPHONE IPOD ETC BUT TRYING TO USE IT BY VOICE IS A REAL BURDEN ONE NIT PICK PLEASE MODIFY THE PRESE 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM OPERATES POORLY AT TIMES MAPS ARE NOT UP TO DATE EITHER
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM REALLY DOES NOT WORK WELL AT ALL WHEN SPEAKING A STREET NAME INTO THE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM GETS IT WRONG 95% OF THE TIME SO WE DON T USE VOICE RECOGNITION AT ALL WE HAVEN T TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER BECAUSE WE GET THE 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM SHOULD BE STANDARD IN ALL VEHICLES THIS IS THE BEST EVER ENJOY MAKING CALLS WHILE DRIVING 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM SOMETIMES MIS INTERPRETS A COMMAND I WILL ASK THE SYSTEM TO TUNE TO A CERTAIN RADIO CHANNEL AND THE SYSTEM WILL DIAL A PHONE NUMBER FROM MY ADDRESS BOOK 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM USUALLY DOESN T UNDERSTAND THE COMMAND I USUALLY HAVE TO REPEAT MY COMMAND AT LEAST TWICE EACH TIME 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM WORKS BETTER THAN ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED THAT HAD A VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IT IS INTUITIVE TO USE AND PERFORMS VERY WELL 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION TAKES TOO MANY ATTEMPTS TO INTERPRET MY COMMANDS CORRECTLY
THE VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE IMPROVED IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MY WIFE OR I ON MANY OCCASIONS WHEN GIVING THE SYSTEM A COMMAND 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE IMPROVED IT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE BASIC COMMANDS 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO MAKE CALLS CHANGE AIR TEMP ETC WITHOUT TAKING HANDS OFF WHEEL
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN I SAY CALL PERSON S NAME HAS BEEN AWFUL NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS MY 2012 SONIC
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN TRYING TO MAKE AN PHONE CALL IS TERRIBLE AND DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY NAMES
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WITH MAKING PHONE CALLS ISN T ALWAYS ACCURATE SOMETIMES IT TAKE 3 TIMES OR MORE FOR THE SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE WHO I WANT TO CALL 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WOMAN IS ANNOYING SHE HAS TROUBLE RECOGNIZING WORDS!!!!
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WORKS EXTREMELY WELL VERY CONVENIENT 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WORKS VERY WELL 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WORKS WELL
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD BE NICE IF I COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE DEALERSHIP WOULD EXPLAIN THE PROCESS TO THE BUYER I WAS TOLD TO READ THE 2 INCH THICK BOOK THAT CAME WITH THE CAR AS MUCH AS I D LIKE TOO THERE 
THE VOICE RECOGNITION/PHONE ADDRESS BOOK INTEGRATION IS THE BEST I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN A VEHICLE
THE VOICE RECOGNITIONS SYSTEM DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MY VOICE MOST OF THE TIME IT IS FRUSTRATING TO USE SO I RATHER NOT USE IT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MONITOR IS BELOW DRIVING EYE LEVEL SO I HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO SEE/READ THE NAV 
THE VOICE RECOGNITIONS SYSTEM SHOULD RECOGNIZE VOICE COMMANDS MORE EFFICIENTLY 
THE VOICE REG SYSTEM MISTAKES MY COMMANDS A LOT HAVE TO MAKE SURE I PRONOUNCE WORDS CORRECTLY HAVE A U CONNECT SYSTEM IN OTHER CAR AND ITS WAY BETTER 
THE VOICE REGONITION IS BAD 
THE VOICE RESPONSE SYSTEM IS BETTER THE SYSTEM PICKS UP YOUR COMMAND ON FIRST REQUEST 
THE VOICE SENSOR NEEDS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS FROM PASSENGER AS WELL AS DRIVER THE DRIVER IS RARELY THE ONLY OCCUPANT AND THE SENSOR HAS DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING THE PASSENGER COMMANDS 
THE VOICE SOUND OF THE HANDSFREE SYSTEM IS A LITTLE CHOPPY AND IT S PITCH IS A LITTLE CREEPY I WISH YOU COULD ADJUST HAVE DIFFERENT VOICES TO CHOOSE FROM OR A WAY TO CREATE A MORE APPEALING VOICE FOR THE SYSTEM A WAY TO CUSTOMISE IT TO YOUR 
THE VOICE SPEAKS INCREDIBLY SLOW AND I HAVE TO WAIT FOR A LONG SPACE AND TONE BEFORE I CAN ANSWER I M CAUCASIAN WITH NO SPECIFIC ACCENT YET IT HAS A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHAT I SAY SHE S NO SIRI IT S EXTREMELY ANNOYING SO I DON T USE IT 
THE VOICE SYNC TO MAKE CALLS 
THE VOICE SYSTEM IS MOST HELPFUL MUCH BETTER THAN PREVIOUS USE OF THE NAV SYSTEM WHICH REQUIRED TYPING IN ADDRESSES ETC THIS IS A CINCH
THE VOICE SYSTEM IS TOO SLOW IN A LOT OF CASES I CAN PUSH THE BUTTON OR NAVIGATE THE SCREEN FASTER 
THE VOICE WITH INSTRUCTIONS SPEAKS TOO SLOWLY 
THE VOLT DOES WHAT I DEMAND OF IT I NEVER TEXT NOR USE THE IPHONE WHILE DRIVING ON LONGER TRIPS MY WIFE WILL PROBABLY USE THE CELL PHONE AND CONNECT TO CELL SERVICES USING THE IPAD 
THE VOLUM DOES NOT GET LOUD ENOUGH AND IT NEEDS A SUB KICKER IN THE SYSTEM FOR A 700 WATT AMP IN THIS CAR THE SOUND SHOULD BE A LOT LOUDER
THE VOLUME AND SPEAKERS DON T CRANK UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS 
THE VOLUME AND THE SPEAKERS
THE VOLUME BUTTON IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF RADIO EASIER ACCESS FOR PASSENGERS BUT MUST STRETCH MYSELF 
THE VOLUME CAN GO A LITTLE HIGHER 
THE VOLUME CAN T BE HEARD IF IT S LESS THAN 20 
THE VOLUME CONTROL IS A PAIN YOU HAVE ROTATE IT ALOT BEFOR IT MAKES A DIFFRENCE UP OR DOWN AND THE SOUND JUST DON T HAVE THE SOUND OF THE OLDER FORDS
THE VOLUME CONTROL IS ON THE LEFT AND THE STATION TUNER IS ON THE RIGHT I HAVE TO REACH ALL THE WAY OVER JUST TO CHANGE A RADIO STATION WOULD BE NICE IF THEY WERE SWITCHED 
THE VOLUME CONTROL IS TOO LOW IT ONLY GOES TO 30 AND IT S NOT LOUD ENOUGH 
THE VOLUME CONTROL KNOB ON CENTER CONSOLE IS IN AN AWKWARD LOCATION AND IT SEEMS DELICATE PASSENGER FREQUENTLY HITS IT INADVERTENTLY I M CONCERNED IT S GOING TO BREAK 
THE VOLUME CONTROL ON THE FRONT OF THE STEERING WHEEL HAS TOO LARGE OF VOLUME CHANGE INCREMENTS IT IS EITHER TOO SOFT OR TOO LOUD WITH A STEP DOWN OR A STEP UP 
THE VOLUME CONTROL ON THE PHONE IS HARD TO ADJUST CHANGING OUT A CD ON THE SINGLE PLAY IS NOT CONVENIENT DIDN T REALIZE THE CAR DID NOT HAVE A MULTI CD CHANGER MY ERROR!
THE VOLUME CONTROL ON THE RADIO IS HORRIBLE IT USES UP/DOWN/MUTE BUTTONS INSTEAD OF A KNOB EVERYONE KNOWS A KNOB WORKS BETTER THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM DOES NOT INCLUDE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR STREAMING AUDIO! AS IF THAT WAS EVEN AN OPTION TO 
THE VOLUME CONTROL ON THE STEARING WHEEL IS TO SLOW YOU HAVE TO PRESS IT SO MANY TIMES TO CHANGE THE VOLUME
THE VOLUME CONTROL ON THE STEERING WHEEL REQUIRES WAY TOO MANY CLICKS TO TURN DOWN THE SOUND 
THE VOLUME CONTROL SEEMS TO BE CONTROLLING NAV VOICE WHEN I WANT LOUDER MUSIC WHEN IN REALITY I RARELY WANT TO CHANGE THE NAV SYSTEM VOICE VOLUME OVERALL I HAVE TO TURN VOLUME UP TO 80 90% BARS TO GET DECENT VOLUME WHICH DOESN T SEEM RIGHT 
THE VOLUME CONTROLS IS ON THE LEFT OF THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE CONTROL ON THE RIGHT I WOULD LIKE THE VOLUME TO BE ON THE RIGHT AND THE CONTROL TO BE ON THE LEFT 
THE VOLUME COULD BE A BIT HIGHER WHEN PLAYING SIRUS AND IPOD
THE VOLUME COULD CHANGE WITH THE ENGINE USE/ SPEED TO PREVENT BEING TOO QUIET DURING DRIVING AND LOUD AT STOPS 
THE VOLUME FROM MUSIC ON THE RADIO CHANGES FROM LOUD TO SOFT 
THE VOLUME FROM THE SIRIUSXM RADIO NEVER GETS LOUD ENOUGH 
THE VOLUME HAS BE TURNED UP 3/4 OF ITS RANGE TO HEAR WHILE HEATING FAN IS ON HIGH 
THE VOLUME IS NOT LOUD EVEN WHEN IT IS ON MAX BOSE SOUND SYSTEM IS MUCH BETTER 
THE VOLUME KNOB IS DIFFICULT TO GRAB ONTO BECAUSE IT IS SO SMALL AND LOCATED IN A PLACE THAT IS NOT COMMON THE TEMPERATURE KNOB IS LOCATED WHERE MOST RADIOS VOLUME SWITCHES WOULD BE 
THE VOLUME KNOB IS PLACED FOR EUROPEAN DRIVERS AND DIFFICULT TO ACCESS NAVIGATING THROUGH EXTERNAL MEDIA IS SLOW AND THE MUSIC DEFAULTS TO AN ON POSITION EACH TIME THE CAR IS STARTED 
THE VOLUME KNOB OF THE RADIO SHOULD BE LARGER 
THE VOLUME KNOB ON THE CONSOLE INCORPORATES A JOYSTICK TO CHANGE CHANNELS ON THE RADIO OR SATELLITE RADIO ETC THIS IS NOT GOOD WHEN A PASSENGER IS IN THE FRONT SEAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO CHANGE CHANNELS WITHOUT NUDGING THEM MY 2012 AUDIT S4 H 
THE VOLUME KNOB SHOULD BE LARGER ENOUGH TO OPERATE EASILY WHILE DRIVING
THE VOLUME LEVEL CHANGES BASED ON SOURCE OF MUSIC WHEN SWITCHING FROM FM TO SAT I HAVE TO RAISE VOLUME LEVEL TO GET SIMILAR LEVEL OF SOUND
THE VOLUME NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE HIGHER IN THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM 
THE VOLUME OF NAVIGATION GUIDE VOICE NEED LOUDER 
THE VOLUME OF READING TEXTS
THE VOLUME OF THE CALL CAN AT TIMES BE LOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PLAYING MEDIA 
THE VOLUME OF THE RINGER FOR INCOMING CALLS IS WAY TOO LOUD IT SCARES THE DRIVER AND PASENGERS
THE VOLUME OF THE TURN BY TURN NAVIGATION THE VOICE THAT COMES THROUGH THE SPEAKERS IS WAY TO LOW YOU MUST LOWER THE MUSIC VOLUME TO DRIVE AND LISTEN FOR DIRECTIONS 
THE VOLUME ON THE NAV IS VERY QUIET I AM SURE I JUST NEED TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT BUT HAVEN T GOTTEN THE BOOK OUT TO FIGURE IT OUT YET 
THE VOLUME ON THE RADIO ONLY GO UP SO HIGH WHICH IS RATHER LOW 
THE VOLUME ON THE RADIO SHOULD GO DOWN AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU RECEIVE A INCOMING CALL
THE VOLUME SCROLL ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IS REALLY HARD TO GET USED TO WHEN I GO TO TURN DOWN THE VOLUME I WANT TO TURN IT DOWN I DON T WANT TO TRY AND RUB IT DOWN PLEASE GO BACK TO A KNOB THANKS HONDA 
THE VOLUMNE CONTROL ON STEERING WHEEL IS AWKWARD 
THE VOLVO SENSUS SYSTEM IS TRULY THE BEST OUT THERE
THE VR IS ANNOYINGLY IT DOESN T PICK UP MY VOICE CONSISTENTLY AND I HAVE NO ACCESS IT DOESN T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THE BSIC COMMANDS 
THE VRS WORKS ACROSS APPLICATIONS NICELY SO EVEN WITH THE RECOGNITION ISSUES IT IS AN ASSET THE GPS IS THE BEST SYSTEM I HAVE YET SEEN IN ANY VEHICLE I VE BEEN IN WHETHER DRIVING OR AS A PASSENGER 
THE VW BEETLE CLASSIC HAS A TOP SAFETY RATING FROM US NEWS & WORLD REPORT THE VEHICLE FEELS SOLID AND THE VISIBILITY IN BOTH FRONT & REAR ARE ABOVE AVERAGE FOR A VEHICLE THIS SIZE THE ONLY SAFETY FEATURE THAT IS LACKING ON THE VW BEETLE CLAS 
THE VW BEETLE CLASSIC S DASHBOARD IS LAID OUT IN A SIMPLE TO USE FORMAT WHICH ALLOWS THE DRIVER TO UTILIZE THE VEHICLE S AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE DRIVER S ATTENTION OR FOCUS ON DRIVING THE 
THE VW CC I HAD BEFORE THIS HAD BETTER HEADLIGHTS ALONG WITH THE TURNING LIGHTS THAT MADE THE VISIBILITY AT NIGHT SO MUCH BETTER 
THE WARNING FOR CROSSING TRAFFIC WHEN IN REVERSE IS HELPFUL IN PARKING LOTS 
THE WARNING LIGHTS
THE WARNING NOISE
THE WARNING SOUNDS ARE NOT LOUD
THE WARNING SYSTEM SOMETIMES GOES OFF EVEN WHEN THERE ARE NO OBSTRUCTIONS 
THE WARNING WHEN A CAR IS IN THE NEXT LANE HAS ALREADY SAVED AN ALMOST CERTAIN WRECK THE VISIBILITY FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS POOR DUE TO THE HEAD RESTS BOTH FRONT AND BACK 
THE WARNINGS WHEN THE SELECTED ROUTE HAS CONSTRUCTION OR TRAFFIC TIE UPS WHEN
THE WASHER FLUID DOESN T GET THE BOTTOM PORTION OF THE WINDSHIELD SO THE WIPERS DON T CLEAN THE WHOLE VISION AREA 
THE WAY IS BILD
THE WAY IT DRIVES
THE WAY IT HANDLES
THE WAY IT LOOKS COULD MAKE IT MORE VISUALLY APPEALING
THE WAY IT WORKS
THE WAY THAT THE DOOR IS MADE FOR THE FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER THE MOLDING BLOCKS THE VIEW WHEN TURNING LEFT INTO TRAFFIC OF ANY TRAFFIC IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE 
THE WAY THE BACK WINDOW PANEL IS SHAPED MAKES IT REAL HARD TO SEE OUT OF WHEN TRYING TO BACK OUT AND LOOK IF ANOTHER CAR IS COMING FROM EITHER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE 
THE WAY THE CELL PHONE AUTOMATICALLY SYNCS WITH THE VEHICLE 
THE WAY THE DRIVERS SEAT IS POSITIONED AND THE LOW PROFILE OF THE HOOD IS PERFECTLY MATCHED IT MAKES IT SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER TO BE ABLE TO SEE OUT ONTO THE ROAD AND EACH AND EVERY CORNER 
THE WAY THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS PLACED MAKES THE SHOULDER LINES LOOK CURVED WHILE YOU ARE GOING STRAIGHT 
THE WAY THE HOOD AND TRUNK ARE SHAPED GIVES ME AN INSECURE SENSE OF MY SPACE WHEN PARKING OR PULLING INTO A SPACE I USUALLY DO NOT PULL IN FAR ENOUGH BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THE FRONT OF THE CAR IS THE SAME APPLIES TO MY BACKING UP 
THE WAY THE NAVIGATION IS SET UP TO ENTER DESTINATION ITS EASY TO OVERLOOK ENTERING THE ADDRESS NUMBER
THE WAY THE REAR IS CONSTRUCTED THE SIDE PANELS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT WHEN REVERSING AND CAUSE A LARGE BLIND SPOT AFTER SOME DRIVING YOU DO GET USED TO THIS
THE WAY THE REAR SEAT WINDOWS ARE DESIGNED ARE OUTSTANDING! THERE ARE ZERO BLIND SPOTS THANK YOU!
THE WAY THE REAR WIPERS & THIRD BRAKE LIGHT IS POSITIONED THE VISIBILITY THROUGH REAR WINDOW IS POOR 
THE WAY THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY SYNCS WITH MY IPHONE IT IS SEAMLESS THE MUTING WHEN A CALL IS IN PROGRESS WORKS WELL 
THE WAY THE WIPERS ARE MADE IS REALLY NICE
THE WAY YOU HAVE TO USE THE MOUSE TO GUIDE YOU THRU THE SYATEM
THE WEAK HORN IS THE ONLY SAFETY FEATURE THAT SLIGHTLY DETRACTS FROM THE FEELING OF SAFETY WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE I WONDER IF OTHER DRIVERS WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR IT IF I NEED TO USE IT 
THE WEATHER APPLICATION WAS BROKEN NOBODY WOULD FIX OR EXCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT THREE MONTHS TO FIX 
THE WEATHER FEATURE DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK 
THE WEATHER INFORMATION IS VERY BENEFICIAL AND THE NAVIGATION VERY ACCURATE INCLUDING TRAFFIC AND ROAD CONSTRUCTION INFO 
THE WEATHER MAP IS VERY NICE TO HAVE
THE WEATHER OPTION IS A JOKE!! THE TRUCK ICON IS BIGGER THAN THE COUNTY YOUR IN SYSTEM NEEDS MORE DETAIL AND ZOOM IN CAPABILITY SEEING A 600 MILE EAST WEST SWATH OF RADAR IS USELESS SYSTEM NEEDS AND AVAILABILITY DETAIL! LIKE AN I PHONE 
THE WEATHER UPDATES ARE REALLY ANNOYING ESPECIALLY IF I AM ON THE HANDS FREE PHONE AND I TRY TO TURN IT DOWN AND END UP DISCONNECTING MY CALL 
THE WHEEL COVERS FALL OFF
THE WHINING NOISE
THE WHOLE CONNECTED CAR ASPECT I THOUGHT THE CONNECTED CAR STUFF WAS HYPE BUT I REALLY LIKE THE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND THE WIFI VERY USEFUL AND I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY 
THE WHOLE INTELLILINK SYSTEM JUST DOES NOT SEEM POLISHED YET I M HOPING FOR SOME TYPE OF SOFTWARE/FIRMWARE UPDATE TO MAKE IT RESPOND TO VOICE COMMANDS BETTER CONNECT TO PHONE VIA USB AND BLUETOOTH MORE QUICKLY AND HAVE THE NAV SYSTEM NOT INTER 
THE WHOLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SO EASY TO USE UNLIKE OTHER CARS WHERE YOU HAVE TO TURN KNOBS PLEASE DON T CHANGE IT 
THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS FANTASIC FOR THE DVD PLAYER IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE MORE CONTROLS IN THE DRIVERS SEAT VS THE REMOTE ALSO FOR A FAMILY VEHICLE THIRD ROQ MONITORS WOULD BE A GREAT ADD
THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS VERY USER FRIENDLY I M NOT ELECTRONICALLY SAVVY SO I M VERY PLEASED THE SYSTEM IS NOT COMPLICATED BUT YET STILL VERY HIGH TECH 
THE WHOLE THING IS TEMPERAMENTAL IN REGARDS TO BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
THE WI FI NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED AS IT DOES NOT ALWAYS CONNECT
THE WIDE ANGEL HEADLIGHTS IS FANTASTIC I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD BE A STANDARD/REQUIRED FEATURE ON ALL VEHICLES
THE WIDE ANGLE MIRRORS WORK MUCH BETTER WHEN MIRRORS ARE UPRIGHT FOR TOWING 
THE WIDE BARS LEADING TO THE ROOF CAN HIDE A CAR THAT TOOK SOME GETTING USED TO 
THE WIDTH OF THE A PILLAR CREATES A BLIND SPOT TO THE RIGHT SIDE 
THE WIDTH OF THE ROOF POSTS FEELS A LITTLE RESTRICTIVE OF VISIBILITY 
THE WIDTH OF THE SUPPORTING COLUMNS AT WINDSHIELD IS TOO WIDE 
THE WIDW NUMBER OF CHOICES AUAILABLE FOR RADIO PRE SETS
THE WIFI
THE WIFI IN THE CAR IS TRULY A DREAM WITH 3 KIDS AND IPADS ETC 
THE WIFI SATELLITE RADIO BLUETOOTH AND ALL COMPUTER TOUCH SCREENS
THE WIFI/BLUETOOTH CONNECTION BETWEEN MY PHONE AND THE CAR IS GREAT IT ALLOWS ME TO MAKE AND RECEIVE CALLS WITH A MINIMUM OF EFFORT 
THE WIND BLOWS THE VEHICLE AROUND 
THE WIND NOISE PREVENTS QUALITY CALLS AND THE TOUCH SCREEN OFTEN HAS TO BE PRESSED MULTIPLE TIMES TO GET THE DESIRED FEATURE 
THE WINDOW BEHIND THE B PILLAR IS SO SMALL THAT IT GETS BLOCKED EASILY BY THE SEATS WHEN SHOULDER CHECKING BLIND SPOTS IT HAS FORCED ME TO UTILIZE A DIFFERENT METHOD OF LOOKING AT MY BLIND SPOTS 
THE WINDOW IN THE BACK IS TO SMALL FEELS LIKE THE BACK END IS TO HIGH HARD TO SEE DRIVERS BEHIND YOU 
THE WINDOW ON THE PASSENGERS SIDE ON THE REAR IS SO LITTLE THAT IT MAKES U DOUGHT YOUR SELF WHEN UR ARE BACKING UP
THE WINDOWS AND PANELS ARE WELL POSITIONED TO HAVETHEMOST VISIBILTY POSSIBLE I ENJOY HOW SAFE I FEEL WHILE DRIVING 
THE WINDOWS ARE SMALL 
THE WINDOWS DON T ALWAYS DEFROST AS QUICKLY AS I WOULD LIKE 
THE WINDOWS DON T SEEM TO BE WIDE ENOUGH ON THE SIDES TO CLEARLY SEE TRAFFIC ESPECIALLY WHEN AT A TELLER MACHINE I HAVE TO OPEN MY DOOR TO USE THE KEY PAD ON THE TELLER MACHINE THE WINDOW OPENING IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO GET MY UPPER BODY THROUGH 
THE WINDOWS SEEM TO BE VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT I LIKE THE ADDITIONAL CUTOUTS UP FRONT AND THE BUILT IN SHADES IN THE MIDDLE THEY BLOCK SUN BUT KEEP VISIBILITY! 
THE WINDOWS TEND TO FOG UP ON THE INSIDE A LOT 
THE WINDSHEILD POST IS IN THE WAY WHEN DRIVING AND MAKING A LEFT TURN
THE WINDSHIELD AND REAR VIEW MIRROR SOMETIMES BLOCK THE VIEW OF OTHER VEHICLES AND STOP LIGHTS
THE WINDSHIELD FRAME SEEMS TO LIMIT VISIBILITY THEY SEEM WIDER THAN MOST VEHICLES I VE DRIVEN 
THE WINDSHIELD HAS WATER SPOT LIKE FILM THAT IS HARD TO REMOVE 
THE WINDSHIELD IS LARGE AND I CAN SEE EVERYTHING IN FRONT OF ME 
THE WINDSHIELD IS LARGE ENOUGH AND SHAPED WELL THIS ALLOWS ME TO ALLOW LANE CHANGES WITH EASE AND SAFETY 
THE WINDSHIELD IS NOT TINTED AND THE SUN VISORS ARE TO SMALL
THE WINDSHIELD IS SO LARGE THAT THE SUN BLOCKAGE ON THE WINDOW DOES NOTHING TO BLOCK THE SUN THE SUN VISORS ARE WAY TOO SMALL 
THE WINDSHIELD IS VERY SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO SEE ANYTHING ABOVE STRAIGHT LINE OF VISION 
THE WINDSHIELD POSTS ARE A BIT WIDE EXTRA CAUTION IS NEEDED AT STOP SIGNS PULLING ONTO STREETS WHERE TRAFFIC IS NOT REQUIRED TO STOP 
THE WINDSHIELD POSTS DO BLOCK MORE OF THE FRONT VISION THAN WHAT I M USED TO 
THE WINDSHIELD SIDE FRAME SOMETIMES OBSTRUCTS MY VIEW OF TRAFFIC APPROACHING FROM THE RIGHT THE HEADRESTS OBSTRUCT PART OF THE VIEW IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THE WINDSHIELD WASHER FLUID JET STREAMS THAT COMES FROM THE FRONT WINDSHIELD ARE TOO STRONG AND DISPERSE TO THE SIDE WINDOWS IF THEY WERE LESS POWERFUL THIS WOULD NOT OCCUR 
THE WINDSHIELD WASHER NOZZLES CANNOT BE ADJUSTED AND THEY SPRAY VERY VERY VERY LOW ONTO THE WINDSHIELD THEY ARE ONLY ACTUALLY EVER EFFECTIVE AT CLEANING THE WINDSHIELD IF YOU USE THE WASHER AT DRIVING SPEEDS OTHERWISE IT IS ALMOST USELESS 
THE WINDSHIELD WASHER SPRAYERS SPRAY IN A SOLID STREAM INSTEAD OF AN EVEN SPRAY I END UP USING MORE THEN I NEED AND IT TENDS TO TAKE A WHILE TO SPREAD ALONG THE ENTIRE WINDSHIELD IT S GRUELING MY ONLY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE CAR AND GETTING IT 
THE WINDSHIELD WASHER SYSTEM IS DESIGNED SO THAT WATER GETS INTO IT AND IT FREEZES WHEN IT IS COLD AND YOU NEED THEM TO CLEAN ROAD CHEMICALS FROM THE WINDSHIELD 
THE WINDSHIELD WASHERS ARE STRAIGHT STREAMS OF FLUID PLEASE CHANGE THE WINDSHIELD WASHER SPRAYERS TO FAN THE FLUID SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS VOLVO MODELS ADDITIONALLY ADD AN OPTION TO ENABLE/DISABLE THE HEADLIGHT WASHERS THEY WASTE A TREMENDOU 
THE WINDSHIELD WASHERS DO NOT WET THE WINDSHIELD UNTIL THE WIPERS HAVE MADE ONE OR TWO DRY SWIPES I CAN SEE THE DUST FLY OFF THE WINDOW THIS WILL SCRATCH THE GLASS OVER TIME OBSCURING GOOD VISIBILITY OUR 2007 WOULD SPRAY THE WINDOW BEFORE 
THE WINDSHIELD WASHERS WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY CAME FROM IN FRONT OF THE WINDSHIELD IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY INSTEAD OF FROM THE WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER ANGLES MAKE FOR A LOT MORE VISIBILITY 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES LEAVE STREAKS AND THE MOISTURE SENSOR COULD BE IMPROVED IT TRIGGERS THE WIPERS WHEN THERE IS VERY LITTLE MOISTURE AND SOME TIMES DOES NOT TRIGGER THEM WHEN THERE IS A LOT OF MOISTURE 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER DESIGN IS TERRIBLE SNOW AND ICE GET IN THE WELL AND THE WIPERS NEVER WORK PROPERLY WITHOUT STOPPING CONTINUALLY TO CLEAR THE DEBRIS OUT
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER SETTING IS TOO FAST AND HAVE TO MANUALLY START AND STOP
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER SPEED IS TOO SLOW ON THE FAST WIPE SETTING 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER SPRAY DOESN T SEEM TO WORK WELL 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER SPRAY IS DIRECTED TO THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD IT SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO COVER MORE OF THE WINDSHIELD 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE A HIT THEY CROSS IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL UNISON MOTION AND BOTH MY WIFE AND I THINK THIS IS GREAT THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AND RIGHT LANE BLIND SPOT CAMERA ARE BOTH APPRECIATED TOO 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE A MYSTERY TO ME I HAVE RAIN SENSING WIPERS AND HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO OPERATE THEM PROPERLY THE MANUAL ON THEIR OPERATION IS WRITTEN IN GREEK!!! I ABSOLUTELY HATE THESE CONTROLS!
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE GREAT AND DIDN T FEEL THE NEED TO GET BETTER ONES THE BACK CAMERA HELPS A LOT WITH SEEING HOW FAR YOU ARE FROM SOMETHING 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT THE GREATEST I HAVE USED AND NORMALLY WHEN YOU BUY A NEW VEHICLE THEY ARE GREAT AND YOU DON T WANT TO REPLACE THEM THE HEADLIGHTS AREN T THAT GREAT EITHER 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT THE SAFEST SUN VISOR DOES NOT ALWAYS DO ITS JOB BUT I LIKE HOW MANY WINDOWS THERE ARE IT MAKES FOR SWITCHING LANES EASY 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE THE BEST EVER THEY RE QUIET AND GIVE EXCELLENT COVERAGE 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE THE WORST ONES MADE
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE TRULY A JOKE THEY DON T EVEN WIPE THE WINDSHIELD VERY POOR CONSTRUCTION I HAD TO BUY NEW WIPER BLADE REPLACEMENTS AND THE CAR ONLY HAS 3600 MILES ON IT THE NEXT THING IS THAT YOU CAN T SEE CARS ON THE SIDE OF YOU 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS CHATTER AT LOW SETTINGS WITH MINIMAL RAIN/MOISTURE 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT ADJUST THAT WELL WHEN RAIN INCREASES
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT COVER THE PASSENGER SIDE VERY WELL THE HEADRESTS FOR THE 2ND ROW SOMEWHAT BLOCK THE REAR VISIBILITY 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DON T REMOVE ALL OF THE WATER FROM THE WINDSHIELD 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS FEEL A BIT FLIMSY 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE SINCE IT LEFT THE DEALER THERE IS A DECEIVING BLIND SPOT
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ICE UP EASILY 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS LEAVE A STREAK AND SOME KIND OF FILM ON THE TOP PASSENGER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD IT S ALL ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD WHEN DRIVING IN HEAVILY SALTED ROADS SO I THINK IT S JUST FROM THAT BUT IT STILL APPEARS AT THE TOP PASSENGER S 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS LEAVE SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED BUT ARE FINE 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS MAKE A STUTTERING NOISE WHEN RUNNING DURING A RAINSTORM
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS MISSES A SMALL PORTION OF THE PASSENGERS WINDSHIELD NEAR THE BOTTOM THIS IS A DESIGN PROBLEM 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON FRONT OF VEHICLE DON T CLEAR WINDSHIELD PROPERLY NEED REPLACING
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SEEM TO BE A LITTLE CHEAP THEY COULD BE STURDIER 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SEEM TO BE VERY FLIMSY AND SOMETIMES LEAVE STREAKING
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SHOULD BE UPGRADED THEY DO A POOR JOB IN MILD RAIN AND ARE BAD IN HEAVY RAIN 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SHOULD EXTEND TO THE TOP RIGHT OF THE WINDSHIELD AS RAIN/DIRT IMPAIRS THE VIEW OF THE PASSENGER
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SQUEAKED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE FIRST RAIN STORM FOR ALMOST 120 MILES I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THEM SINCE 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY INSTALLED ARE NOT TOO EFFECTIVE WITH VISIBILITY WHEN IT WAS SNOWING I HAD TO CONTINUE TO USE THE WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID TO REMOVE BUILD UP ON THE GLASS THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER DOESN T HAVE THIS ISSUE WH 
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WERE SO BAD AND BRAND NEW THAT I REPLACED IMMEDIATELY WITH HIGHER QUALITY
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORK GOOD BUT THEY THROW WATER INTO THE PATH OF THE OTHER ONE ON THE WAY BACK DOWN THE WINDSHIELD ISN T WIPED CLEAN WHEN THE WIPERS COME BACK DOWN THIS HAPPENS EVEN DURING A LIGHT RAIN THEY ALSO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE 
THE WING BISECTS THE REAR VISION AND THE LOWERED AIR SPLITTER UP FRONT MAKES THIS CAR A PRIME CANDIDATE FOR FRONT/REAR CAMERAS 
THE WING BLOCKS MY VIEW A LITTLE BIT
THE WING BLOCKS REAR VISABLITY
THE WING IS LESS OBTRUSIVE THAN YOU D THINK AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY THE UN CRASHABILITY OF THE CAR AWD LIMITED SLIP DIFFERENTIALS BIG BRAKES STIFF SUSPENSION BUT NOT THE ELECTRONICS LIKE THE TRACTION CONTROL IS ITS SELLING POINT TO ME 
THE WIPER ARMS DO NOT EXTEND TOTALLY OUT WHEN WASHING FRONT WINDOW 
THE WIPER BLADE ON THE DRIVER SIDE DOES NOT CLEAR SO WELL I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED HOW IT CLEANS IN WORKS I GIVE IT A RATING OF A 5
THE WIPER BLADES SEEM VERY FLIMSY AND NOT HOLDING UP WELL WITH THE COLD WEATHER 
THE WIPER BLADES WHEN IN OPERATION THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER BLADE STOPS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER S FIELD OF VIEW EXTREMELY DISTRACTING!!!
THE WIPER COVERAGE ON PASSENGER SIDE IS NOT QUITE GETTING FULL WIPE 
THE WIPER DESIGN LEAVES A STREAK ON THE PASSENGER SIDE THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED WITH PROPER LENGTH WIPERS FOR BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER STILL UNSURE HOW THIS AUTOMATIC WIPER SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO WORK 
THE WIPER FLUID DOES NOT DISPENSE EVENLY ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD SO WHEN DRIVING IN SNOW / SLUSHY CONDITIONS ABILITY TO KEEP THE DRIVER SIDE WINDSHIELD CLEAN FOR VISABILITY WAS DIFFICULT THIS WINTER THE WIPER BLADES ALSO DID NOT DO WELL IN COLDE 
THE WIPER INSTALLED AT FACTORY LEAVE STREAKS UNLIKE HIGHER QUALITY BLADES
THE WIPER NEEDS TO COVER WIDER SPACE AND TO CLEAN WASHER FLUID BETTER
THE WIPER NEVER CLEAR THE MIDDLE SECTION OF THE WINDSHIELD 
THE WIPER SENSORY SYSTEM IS NOT GOOD
THE WIPER SPEED SHOULD BE GO HIGHER IN HEAVIER RAINS ALSO THE WIPERS SKIP PART OF THE WINDSHIELD IT IS LIKE THE BLADE DOESN T TOUCH THE WIDOW 
THE WIPER SPEED SHOULD BE MORE ADJUSTABLE
THE WIPER SPRAY IS SOMEWHAT WEAK ESPECIALLY IN FRONT OF OF THE DRIVER I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF A GUSH!
THE WIPERS AND BASE OF THE WINDSHEILD ICE UP QUICKLY AND DO NOT MET EASILY EVEN UNDER DEFROST
THE WIPERS ARE ALREADY STARTING TO LOSE EFFECTIVENESS WITHIN 5 MONTHS OF OWNING IT!
THE WIPERS ARE EFFECTIVE BUT HAVE ONLY 3 SETTINGS REGULAR FAST AND AUTO INTERMITTENT THE REGULAR SETTING IS TOO FAST FOR NORMAL LIGHT RAIN THUS INTERMITTENT IS USED THE CAR DOES NOT HAVE A MANUAL SETTING FOR INTERMITTENT ONLY AUTO AND THE 
THE WIPERS ARE GOOD I WISH MAZDA WOULD HAVE USED A BETTER QUALITY BLADE TO RAPPEL WATER OFF SUCH AS A RAINX BRAND THE WINDSHIELD HAS A ANGLE ON IT THAT JUST DOSEN T ASSIST WITH THE REMOVAL OF THE WATER THIS WAS EASILY CORRECTED BY REPLACING THE 
THE WIPERS ARE HORRIBLE IN THE SNOW CONDITIONS 
THE WIPERS ARE HORRIBLE! AGAIN BETTER WIPERS ON MY LINCOLN!!
THE WIPERS ARE NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL THEY DON T KEEP THE WINDSHIELD CLEAN AT ALL AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED ONCE I BOUGHT IT 
THE WIPERS ARE POSITIONED PARTIALLY UNDERNEATH THE HOOD DURING THE WINTER THIS POSITION MAKES CLEARING SNOW AND ICE OFF OF THE WIPERS DIFFICULT AND ALLOWS SNOW AND ICE TO ACCUMULATE BOTH CIRCUMSTANCES PROHIBITS EASE OF CLEANING DURING THE WINTER 
THE WIPERS ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO LEARN
THE WIPERS ARE TERRIBLE IN SNOW I NEED THEM REPLACED ALREADY 
THE WIPERS ARE TERRIBLE YOU CANT SEE A THING IN THE SNOW OR RAIN TOTALLY FEEL SHORT 
THE WIPERS ARE TRICKY TO FIGURE OUT 
THE WIPERS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AND THE WASHERS ARE OUTSTANDING AND MEAN BUSINESS !
THE WIPERS AREN T AS AFFECTIVE AS I D LIKE THEY ONLY CLEAR MOST OF THE STUFF FROM THE WINDSHIELD BUT SOME STUFF REMAINS SOMETIMES 
THE WIPERS AREN T EFFECTIVE IT S DIFFICULT TO GET A CLEAN SCREEN
THE WIPERS AT REGULAR INTERMITTENT SPEED SEEM VERY SLOW COMPARED TO OTHER BMW S SUNLIGHT OFTEN TIMES REFLECTS OFF OF CARBON FIBRE TRIM DIRECTLY INTO MY EYES WHICH IS EXTREMELY DISTRACTING 
THE WIPERS BUILD UP WITH ICE AND SNOW EASILY DUE TO THE WAY THEY SIT DOWN IN A GAP AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD 
THE WIPERS CONTINUALLY SMEAR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE EVEN AFTER HAVING BEEN REPLACED 
THE WIPERS COULD STAND TO HAVE ONE MORE SETTING OPTION TOWARDS FASTER 
THE WIPERS DIDNT PERFORM WELL IN SNOW FROZE OVER CONSTANTLY
THE WIPERS DO A VERY BAD JOB OF CLEANING THE FRONT WINDSHIELD DUE TO THE HEAD RESTS IN THE BACK SEAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW THE TINY SIDE WINDOWS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT 
THE WIPERS DO AN OK JOB BUT COULD BE BETTER AT WIPING RAIN AWAY 
THE WIPERS DO AN OK JOB OF KEEPING MY WINDSHIELD CLEAR BUT IT SEEMS TO REQUIRE MORE WIPER FLUID THAN IN PREVIOUS CARS TO ASSURE A GOOD CONTACT POINT WITH THE WINDSHIELD GIVEN ITS SHAPE 
THE WIPERS DO NOT REACH TO THE EDGE OF THE GLASS AND THERE IS ALWAYS DIRT REMAINED AFTER WIPING
THE WIPERS DON T REACH THE WHOLE WINDOW THERE IS ONE SPOT BY THE PASSENGER SIDE THAT THE WIPER NEVER GETS TO IT IT IS BETWEEN THE 2 WIPER BLADES 
THE WIPERS DON T SEEM AS SUBSTANTIAL AND EFFECTIVE WITH CLEARING THE WINDSHIELD
THE WIPERS DON T SEEM TO BE AS GOOD AS OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE HAD THEY DON T REACH A BROAD ENOUGH AREA AND THEY LEAVE SMALL STREAKS ON THE OTHER HAND I LOVE THE BLISS SYSTEM JUST DROVE BACK FROM FLORIDA TO MASSACHUSETTS WITH MY HUSBAND AND I WA 
THE WIPERS DON T WORK AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD 
THE WIPERS DRAG ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD IT S THE ONE THING I REALLY DISLIKE ABOUT THE CAR I PREVIOUSLY DROVE AN INFINITI AND IF YOU CLOSED YOUR EYES YOU WOULDN T KNOW WHETHER THEY WERE ON OR NOT THEY WERE SO SMOOTH AND QUIET I M DISAPPOINTED 
THE WIPERS FREQUENTLY LEAVE SPLASHES OF LIQUID ON THE WINDSHIELD THE SUN VISORS WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE IF THEY WERE EXTENDABLE 
THE WIPERS HAVE NO AUTO FEATURE THE ENTIRE PROCESS IS MANUAL
THE WIPERS HAVE TROUBLE GETTING WINDOWS CLEAN AND ICE OFF DURING COLD DAYS OF WINTER EVEN WITH DEFROSTERS ON FULL BLAST ALSO THE SUN VISORS CAN USE AN EXTENDER WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING THROUGH THE SIDE FRONT WINDOWS 
THE WIPERS IN THE FRONT ARE NOT EFFECTIVE AT ALL 
THE WIPERS LEAVE A BEADED FILM OF WATER IN THEIR PATH THE REAR WINDOWS ARE SMALL BECAUSE CHEVY S AESTHETIC BUT THIS HAMPERS VISIBILITY 
THE WIPERS MISS THE LOWER MIDDLE SECTION OF THE WINDSHLIED WHEN SPRAYING WINDSHIELD WASH ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING IT S DRY IN THAT SPOT AND JUST STREAKS I MOSTLY ONLY USE IT WHEN SITTING STILL 
THE WIPERS NEED A MIST SETTING 
THE WIPERS ON MY VERSA KINDA SUCKS IT DOESN T CLEAN THE WINDOW UNLESS I HAVE TO MANUALLY CLEAN IT MYSELF
THE WIPERS SEEM TO ACCUMULATE ICE ON THEM WHEN IT SNOWED WHICH MADE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE 
THE WIPERS SEEM TO ICE UP AND DON T DEFROST AS THE CAR WARMS UP THE SNOW PACKS INTO THE WELL WHERE THE WIPERS GO AND IT CAUSES SOME BACK UP
THE WIPERS SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC AS A STANDARD FEATURE ESPECIALLY ON A IS350 F SPORT
THE WIPERS SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO MANUALLY TURN ON MY WIPERS ESPECIALLY IN A HEAVY DOWN POUR
THE WIPERS SHOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE 
THE WIPERS SHOULD BE WHERE THEY CAN BE THAWED DURING WINTER BOTH OF MY CHEVY VEHICLES HAVE WIPERS TOO LOW SO THEY STAY FROZEN IN THE WINTER NEED TO BE ABLE THAW WIPERS IN COLD CLIMATES 
THE WIPERS SHOULD HAVE A HIGHER SPEED FOR HEAVY RAIN 
THE WIPERS STREAK FOR BEING BRAND NEW AND FREEZE OFTEN
THE WIPERS SUCK THE HEADLIGHTS AREN T TOO BRIGHT
THE WIPERS TEND TO DO ONE LAST WIPE WHEN NOT NECESSARY
THE WIPERS THAT CAME WITH THE CAR ARE JUNK 
THE WIPERS WHILE ON INTERMITTENT ARE STILL TOO FAST FOR SUCH A SMALL WINDSHIELD 
THE WIPERS WORK GREAT IN THE RAIN AND THE RAIN SENSOR SYSTEM WORKS WELL IN SNOW HOWEVER THEY ARE MUCH LESS EFFECTIVE WHEN EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF SNOW OR ICE GETS CAKED ON THEM 
THE WIPERS WORK WELL BUT CAN BE A BIT LOUD WHEN ON HIGH 
THE WIPERS/HEATERS DO NOT WORK IN SNOW/ICE CONDITIONS THE REAR WINDOW DEFROSTERS ONLY CLEAR 1/2 THE WINDOW
THE WIPERS/WASHERS ARE THE BEST I VE EVER USED OR SEEN 
THE WIPERS/WASHERS HAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WINDSHIELD WIPERS FREQUENCY FOR EXAMPLE 
THE WIPERS/WASHERS IN FRONT DIDN T WORK WELL WHEN WE HAD RAIN/ICE 
THE WIRE CONNECTION FOR CELLPHONE IS LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL BOX AND IS CUMBERSOME AND OFTEN DISLODGES ITSELF FROM THE PHONE
THE WORST NAV SYSTEM I HAVE EVER USED DIFFICULT INACCURATE SLOW 
THE WORST PART OF CHANGING LANES WITH THE CHALLENGER WHEN AFTER PASSING A VEHICLE AND LOOKING OVER THE PASSENGER FRONT SEAT OUT THE QUARTER PANEL WINDOW MOUNTED IN THE SAIL PART OF THE ROOF SUPPORT THE PASSENGER HEAD REST BLOCKS MOST OF THE VIE 
THE WORST THING IS THE VISIBILITY WHENEVER CARS DRIVE UP TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT 
THE WORST VISIBILITY IS ON THE RIGHT REAR FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU ARE PASSING AND WANT TO GET BACK IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE I HAVEN T HAD ANY NEAR MISSES OR ANYTHING BUT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT THAT IS BOTHERSOME 
THE WORST WINDSHIELD WIPERS OF ANY CAR THAT I HAVE EVER DRIVEN RAIN SNOW AND DIRT GET PUSHED TO THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW AND WIPERS DO NOT CLEAR WELL 
THE WRANGLER DOESN T TRACK AS STRAIGHT ON THE ROAD AS I D LIKE 
THE WRX HAS EXCELLENT VISIBILITY COMPARED TO MY LAST CAR 
THE X MODE FEATURE IS A DEFINITE PLUS WE HAVE A STEEP DRIVEWAY AND EVEN IN WET SNOW THIS WINTER THE VEHICLE NEVER LOST TRACTION GOING DOWNHILL 
THE XENON HEADLIGHTS ARE TRULY MARVELOUS AND THE REAR LIGHTING IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE XM RADIO DOES NOT KEEP A SIGNAL I DON T KNOW IF THAT IS THE RADIO SERVICE PROBLEM OR CONNECTIVITY WITH THE CAR 
THE XM/SIRIUS COMBINED WITH THE FACTORY SOUND SYSTEM SOUNDS AMAZING I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE OUT ALL THE WORDS THE BANDS ARE SAYING REGARDLESS OF VOLUME 
THE XTERRA HAS A SERIOUS BLINK SPOT ON WHEN LOOKING REAR LEFT
THE XTERRA HAS GREAT HEADLIGHTS NOT THOSE ANNOYING LIGHTS THAT ARE SUPER BRIGHT TO OTHER DRIVERS AND DON T ILLUMINATE THE ROAD FOR YOU BUT HEADLIGHTS THAT LET YOU SEE THE ROAD AND WHAT S ON THE SIDES OF THE ROAD 
THE XTS DRIVES IT SELF WHAT A GREAT FEELING VERY SOLID AND SAFE FEELING
THE Y CABLE IS HORRIBLE I CAN NOT ALWAYS CONNECT MY IPHONE 6 AND THE LOCATION OF WHERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE PHONE IS NOT DRIVER FRIENDLY I LOVE MY COUNTRYMAN BUT I FIND THE ASPECT OF IT VERY DISAPPOINTING 
THE YELLOW WARNING LIGHT ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS IS AMAZING FOR THE BLIND SPOT
THEIR ARE BLIND SPOTS WHILE DRIVING THEY SAY ALL SUV CARS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM THIS IS MY FIRST SUV THE BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS BLOCK THE BACK WINDOW VIEWING FOR ME 
THEIS CARE NEEDS A BACKUP CAMERA IT S REALLY HARD TO SEE BEHIND THE CAR S REAR WHEN BACKING UP ALSO AWFUL BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING FROM DRIVEWAY AND LOOKING FOR ONCOMING CROSS TRAFFIC

THERE IS PLENTY OF VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S POSITION 
THERE IS POOR VISIBILITY TO THE SIDES OF THE CAR WHEN THE TOP IS CLOSED
THERE IS POOR VISIBILITY WHEN USING THE HEADLIGHT S LOW BEAMS THERE IS A VERY DISTRACTING OBVIOUS DARK LINE WHERE THE LIGHT ENDS AND THE LIGHT DOES NOT EXTEND FAR ENOUGH IN FRONT OF THE CAR 
THERE IS QUITE A LAG WHEN USING THE VOICE COMMAND AND IPHONE THE TEXT MESSAGE FUNCTION APPEARS TO EITHER NOT BE FUNCTIONAL ON MY TRUCK OR I DON T KNOW HOW TO USE IT WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR ME USING COMPUTER DEVICES I GUESS I NEED TO SPEND MORE TI 
THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF INFORMATION TO LEARN ABOUT OPERATING THE AUDIO AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS EFFECTIVELY THE OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS ARE HELPFUL JUST A LOT TO LEARN 
THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE VEHICLE TAKES TO RECOGNIZE A BLUETOOTH DEVICE 
THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON THE HEADLIGHTS THEY ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH 
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS FOR CHECKING REAR VIEW FROM THE DRIVING POSITION 
THERE IS SO MUCH INFORMATION AVAILABLE THAT IT MAKES TRAVELLING MUCH EASIER 
THERE IS SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO MAKE THIS BETTER THE UI IS UNINTUITIVE AND THE CONTROLS DON T EVEN WORK WELL WITH MY IPHONE I CAN T USE THIS TO READ/WRITE TEXTS AND ALBUM ART DOESN T DISPLAY OVER BLUETOOTH ALSO I HAVE TO DISCONNECT/RECONNECT MY 
THERE IS SO MUCH TO LIST IT DOESN T FEEL NATURAL YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY TELL THAT THIS WAS AN AFTERTHOUGHT IT S SIMPLY AN AFTERMARKET SCREEN WITH SUBARU WRITTEN ON TOP ONE OF THE WORST I VE SEEN I DON T EVEN BOTHER USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION FM 
THERE IS SOME BLIND SPOTS KIND OF WISH THAT I HAD GONE WITH THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA 
THERE IS SOME DIFFICULTY SEEING OUT OF THE VEHICLE TO THE BACK HOWEVER THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS BACKUP CAMERA AND PARKING ASSIST SOLVE THE PROBLEM COMPLETELY 
THERE IS SOME LOSS OF VISION FROM THE POLES THAT ATTACHED THE ROOF TO THE AUTO YOU HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHEN PULLING ONTO A STREET 
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS THROUGH THE SIRIUS CHANNELS ONLY SEEMS TO FLIP THROUGH USING THE DIAL ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SYSTEM WHEN I TRY TO FLIP SIRIUS CHANNELS USING THE LEFT RIGHT ARROWS ON THE STEERING WHEEL 
THERE IS SOMETIMES A DELAY WHEN USING BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE CALLS
THERE IS SOMEWHAT OF A BLIND SPOT IN THE DRIVERS SIDE ALSO THE SUN VISORS SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PULL DOWN IN ADDITION TO THE VISOR ITSELF AS IT JUST DOES NOT KEEP THE SUN OUT OF MY EYES DOES NOT SEEM BIG ENOUGH
THERE IS SOMEWHAT OF AN OBSTRUCTED VIEW IN THE CORNERS OF THE FRONT WINDOW
THERE IS THE HIGH QUALITY OF A BOSE MUSIC SYSTEM BUT BROUGHT DOWN BY THE VERY LOW QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS AT HIGHWAY SPEED THE CAR IS NATURALLY NOISY AND THE SPEAKERS ARE SIMPLY NOT UP TO THE TASK 
THERE IS THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN GREAT VISIBILITY AND STYLING AND I AM HAPPY WITH THE BALANCE ACHIEVED 
THERE IS THE TYPICAL DRIVERS SIDE BLIND SPOT
THERE IS TO MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO BACK UP
THERE IS TO MUCH EFFORT NEEDED A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT
THERE IS TOO MUCH DELAY WHEN SEARCHING FOR A PHONE TO START LISTENING TO MY PANDORA IT OFTEN TIMES JUST STOPS WORKING
THERE IS TOO MUCH DISTANCE BETWEEN SIDE WINDOW AND FRONT WINDSHIELD WITH NO GLASS I VERY FREQUENTLY CAN NOT SEE ROAD LINES OR TRAFFIC FOR A FEW SECONDS WHEN TURNING LEFT BUT I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE REAR CAMERA
THERE IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION BEING SHOWN ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN AT A QUICK GLANCE YOU SHOULD ONLY NEED TO SEE THE ACTUAL MAP AND NOT A SIDE LINK OF EXITS AND ROUTE NUMBERS TOO DISTRACTING 
THERE IS TOO MUCH LAG TIME BETWEEN MY VERBAL INPUT AND THE VOICE RESPONSE OF THE SYSTEM
THERE IS TOO MUCH REFELCTION FROM THE FRONT AIR SYSTEM IN THE WINDSHIELD SUCKS!
THERE ISN T A GOOD SPOT TO HOLD/MOUNT A SMARTPHONE
THERE ISN T ENOUGH BASS SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE TUNED MORE FOR TREBLE 
THERE ISN T ENOUGH POWER IN THE SYSTEM TO HEAR MUSIC OVER THE SOUND OF THE CAR NOISE 
THERE ISNT SATELLITE RADIO
THERE MAY BE A SMALL BLIND SPOT FOR SEEING THE CAR COMING FROM BEHIND ON PASSENGER SIDE SWITCHING LANES SUDDENLY I NOTICED THE OTHER DAY DRIVERS HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THIS
THERE NEEDS TO BE A A LITTLE VISOR TO BLOCK THE SUN BETWEEN REAR VIEW MIRROR AND TOP OF ROOF
THERE NEEDS TO BE A REAR CAMERA INSTALLED IN ALL THE VEHICLES 
THERE NEEDS TO BE A SAVED CHANNEL CHANGE BUTTON THERE IS NOT YOU HAVE TO CLICK THE SAVED CHANNEL YOU WANT HARD FOR THE PASSENGER TO DO 
THERE NEEDS TO BE A SLOWER SPEED FOR THE WIPERS BETWEEN NOT RUNNING AND THE FIRST SPEED AS THE FIRST SPEED IS TOO FAST FOR LIGHT DRIZZLES
THERE NEEDS TO BE A STANDARD INSTALL ON ALL VEHICLES TO HAVE BLIND SIDE SIGNALS ON MIRRORS AND FOR CHANGING LANES NOT HAVING IT CREATES RISK FOR WRECKS
THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EASY WAY FOR THE PASSENGER TO CONTROL THE RADIO AND MIDDLE SCREEN EVEN WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING IT WOULD BE A SIMPLE SENSOR IN THE PASSENGER SEAT THAT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE IS A PASSENGER THERE! THAT WAY THEY COULD CHANGE THE 
THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE SPEAKERS THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLE 
THERE REALLY IS NO ONE WAY TO PINPOINT HOW EXCEPTIONAL MERCEDES BENZ AND THE WAY THEY CRAFT THEIR CARS IS I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE NAME THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED HAS PUT THEM IN A CLASS BY THEMSELVES 
THERE REALLY SHOULD BE A GPS SYSTEM THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR AN APP AND CONNECT A SMART PHONE FOR THAT IS JUST RIDICULOUS!
THERE S A BAR THAT SEPARATES ONE PART OF THE REAR WINDOW FROM A LOWER PART I DON T SEE THE HEADLIGHTS OF A VEHICLE DIRECTLY BEHIND ME IT S NOT A COMPLETE HINDRANCE JUST MAKES ME UNEASY 
THERE S A BIG BLIND SPOT IN THE REAR THIRD OF THE VEHICLE BUT THE BACK UP CAMERA IS HELPFUL FOR THAT 
THERE S A BLIND SPOT LOOKING BACK TOWARDS THE REAR ANGLE/CORNER CHANGING LANE HAS BEEN HAZARDOUS 
THERE S A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN A VEHICLE IS DRIVING NEXT TO ME NOT PICKED UP BY THE SIDE MIRROR 
THERE S A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER SIDE WHICH IS UNPLEASANT 
THERE S A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING FRONT RIGHT & THERE IS SOME DIFFICULTY LOOKING LEFT & TO THE REAR BECAUSE OF THE POST BETWEEN THE LEFT SIDE DOORS 
THERE S A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING TO THE RIGHT
THERE S A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT DRIVER SIDE
THERE S BLIND SPOT BEHIND THE DOOR DIVIDER AND THE HEADREST I DON T LIKE
THERE S NO INTERIOR INDICATOR THAT THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON
THERE S NO LITTLE ROUND MIRROR TO DETECT DRIVERS IN BLIND SIDE AREA
THERE S NO TOUCH SCREEN AND THE SCREEN IS RATHER SMALL COMPARED TO AMERICAN VEHICLES ALTHOUGH THE MMI ISN T BAD TAKE A LOOK AT FORD S NAV/RADIO BY SONY IT S LEAGUES ABOVE AUDI IN ALL WAYS 
THERE S NO VISIBLE VOLUME INDICATOR THE GRAPHICS ON THE RADIO COULD BE A LITTLE SMALLER SO THAT THE ARTIST AND SONG TITLE COULD BOTH BE DISPLAYED 
THERE S NOTHING I DISLIKE
THERE S SLIGHT BLIND SPOTS TOWARDS THE REAR SIDES WHEN CHANGING LANES I RELY MORE ON THE SIDE MIRRORS FOR ASSISTANCE THAN I D LIKE TO 
THERE S SO MANY FAVORITE STATION BUTTONS GREAT FEATURE 
THERE S TOO MANY OPTIONS FOR ME
THERE SEAMS TO BE A VERY SLIGHT DELAY WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN PRE SELECTED STATIONS PREVIOUS CARS THAT HAD BUTTON RADIOS WERE MUCH FASTER 
THERE SEEM TO BE MORE BLIND SPOTS IN THE PRIUS COMPARED TO OTHER CARS I HAVE DRIVEN 
THERE SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE NO BLIND SPOTS 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BAD BLIND SPOT I DON T THINK THE REAR WINDOW OR SIDE WINDOWS ARE BIG ENOUGH 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT AREA FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW WHERE BAR IS LOCATED 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT THAT WASN T THERE IN MY 2001 ACURA BUT THEN IT MIGHT JUST BE ME 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING FOR APPROACHING CARS ON PASSENGER SIDE
THERE SEEMS TO BE A DANGEROUS BLIND SPOT 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A FAIRLY BIG BLIND SPOT ON THE VEHICLE THE MIRRORS AND ADDITIONAL FEATURES HELP WITH THIS 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A GOOD SIZE BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDES I VE BEEN SURPRISED SEVERAL TIMES TO DISCOVER A CAR COMING UP BESIDE ME WHEN I M PREPARING TO CHANGE LANES 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LARGER THEN USUAL BLIND SPOT ON EITHER SIDE
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A BLIND SPOT ON SIDE TOWARDS BACK AND SMALL SIDE MIRRORS DOES NOT HELP 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP IN THIS VEHICLE 
THERE SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING MY VOICE I HAVE TO ALMOST SHOUT OR SPEAK AS IF I AM ANGRY FOR IT TO UNDERSTAND ME WOMEN GENERALLY HAVE A SOFTER VOICE THEN MEN SO MAYBE IT COULD BE ADJUSTED IT IS VERY AGGRAVATING TO SAY A COMMAND OVE 
THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ABOVE AVERAGE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES LEFTWARD THE SUN VISORS ARE TOO SHORT AND NOT HELPFUL AS THE SUN SETS WHEN YOU NEED THEM THE MOST 
THERE SEEMS TO BE BLIND SPOT WHEN SHIFT TO A LANE ON THE RIGHT
THERE SEEMS TO BE BLIND SPOTS 
THERE SEEMS TO BE QUITE A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE ESPECIALLY WHEN MERGING ONTO FREEWAY TRAFFIC ALSO THERE IS NO SLIDE MECHANISM ON THE VISORS TO HELP BLOCK THE AREA BETWEEN THE VISOR AND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
THERE SEEMS TO BE QUITE A FEW BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES OR WHEN LOOKING RIGHT FOR TRAFFIC WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A LEFT HAND TURN WHEN MAKING A SHARP TURN I FEEL NERVOUS THAT THE CAR MAY TIP OVER SO I DRIVE SLOWER AROUND TURNS WHEN I 
THERE SEEMS TO BE TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS 
THERE SHLD BE AN DOWNWARD EXTENSION ON THE DRIVER VISOR FOR DRIVERS UNDER 5 3 
THERE SHOULD BE A CONTROL FUNCTION ON THE STEERING WHEEL THAT LETS YOU SIP BETWEEN THE SAVED STATIONS PROGRAMMED INTO THE RADIO 
THERE SHOULD BE A DOUBLE VISOR ONE FOR THE FRONT AND ONE FOR THE SIDE 
THERE SHOULD BE A NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM 
THERE SHOULD BE A SHORT CLASS EVERY SO OFTEN WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT UP TO DATE ON THESE NEW DEVICES COULD HANDS ON INSTRUCTIONS FROM A FORD REP 
THERE SHOULD BE A SOUND INDICATOR IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AT THE POINT AT WHICH YOU SHOULD TURN I FOUND THIS HELPFUL IN MY HAND HELD NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
THERE SHOULD BE A VOLUME CONTROL ON THE STEERING WHEEL 
THERE SHOULD BE A WAY FOR A PASSENGER TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION 
THERE SHOULD BE A WAY THE PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT COULD OPERATE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING 
THERE SHOULD BE A WEIGHT ON SEAT SWITCH IN THE PASSENGER SEAT TO ACTIVATE THE NAV SYSTEM SO HE/SHE COULD USE IT WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION 
THERE SHOULD BE AN EASIER WAY TO DIAL FREQUENTLY USED NUMBERS A FAVORITES SCREEN FOR FREQUENTLY DIALED PHONE NUMBERS 
THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION FOR A DONUT OR SPARE TIRE OTHERWISE GETTING STRANDED IS A REAL POSSIBILITY REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT WITH THE SPLIT WINDSHIELD 
THERE SHOULD BE HEARING AID COMPATIBILITY FOR HARD OF HEARING 
THERE SHOULD BE MORE OR BRIGHTER LIGHT WHEN BACKING UP 
THERE SHOULD BE SENSORS WHEN TO CLOSE TO OTHER CARS 
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXTENTIONS IN THE SUN VISOR TO BLOCK THE CENTER AREA BEHING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY KIND OF RECALL OR SUSPENSION NOISE FOR THIS KIND OF CAR IN WHICH YOUR COMPANY CLAIM TO BE BETTER OTHER BRAND TOYOTA HONDA NISSAN ETC 
THERE SHOULD NOT BE THE MIDDLE HEADREST IN THE BACK SEAT BECAUSE IT BLOCKS THE VISION IN THE REAR 
THERE WERE ISSUES WITH COMPATIBILITY WITH SOME I POD MODELS THAT CAUSED YOU TO HAVE TO RESET YOUR I POD YOU ARE REQUIRED TO ENTER ADDRESSES INTO THE NAV SYSTEM IN A STRANGE ORDER 
THERES A LOT TO LEARN
THERES A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT IN THE BACK CORNER I HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK 
THERES NOT ENOUGH VOLUME TO HEAR PHONE CALLS INTO SYSTEM VIA BLUETOOTH
THESE CARS HAVE LIMITED REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY ALTHOUGH HAVING THE BACK UP CAMERA DOES HELP A GREAT DEAL THE HIGH REAR DECK DOES COMPROMISE THAT VIEW I REALLY MISS MY 2010 S FEATURE WITH SIDE MIRRORS WHICH AUTOMATICALLY TILTED DOWN WHEN BACK 
THESE CARS NEED SIDE VIEW CAMERAS THE WARNING LIGHT IS NICE BUT DIFFICULT TO GAUGE
THESE DO NOT APPLY AS I DO NOT LISTEN OR USE DEVICES IN THE CAR 
THESE ITEMS ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY MAKE ME LOVE THIS VEHICLE 
THESE MODELS ALL SEEM TO DIRTY THE BACK WINDOW MORE SO THAN A REGULAR CAR
THESE SUN VISORS ARE USELESS !
THESE SYSTEMS ARE AMAZINGLY SIMPLE RELATIVELY INTUITIVE AND ERGONOMICALLY LOCATED AND OVERALL USEFUL I TRAVEL FOR BUSINESS APPROXIMATELY 45 WEEKS AND RENT MANY MAKES AND MODELS OF CARS THE VOLVO XC70 SYSTEMS ARE AMONG THE BEST I HAVE ENCOUNTERED 
THESE SYSTEMS HELP ME BE A SAFER DRIVER BECAUSE MY HANDS NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE THE WHEEL AND MY EYES ARE ALWAYS ON THE ROAD!
THESE SYSTEMS WORK VERY WELL AND ARE RELIABLE IN TERMS OF BOTH TOUCH SCREEN USAGE AND VOICE COMMANDS AS WITH ANY TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM IT JUST TAKES SOME GETTING USE TO AND READING THE DIRECTIONS 
THEY ALL ARE USER FRIENDLY CLEAR AND WELL PLACED IN THE VEHICAL 
THEY ALL NEED MIRROR S THAT DEFROST!!!!!
THEY ARE ALL EASY TO USE
THEY ARE ALL EXCELLENT THE PROBLEM IS THAT I AM NEW TO THOSE SYSTEMS AND STILL LEARNING ONCE I MASTER THE PROCEDURES I AM SURE I WILL ENJOY IT EVEN MORE 
THEY ARE ALL RICH IN QUALITY
THEY ARE CLEAR AND EASY TO OPERATE 
THEY ARE EASY TO USE!
THEY ARE SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO PROGRAM AND UNDERSTAND
THEY ARE TOO COMPLICATED WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING ESEPCIALLY WHEN MOVING FROM ONE ITEM TO ANOTHER 
THEY COULD HAVE DISAPPEARING HEAD REST WHEN NO BODY IS IN THE BACK SEATS THIS WOULD HELP SEEING OUT THE BACK WINDOW 
THEY COULD MAKE AN AUDIO UPGRADE AVAILABLE WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY FOUR WHEEL DRIVE!
THEY COULD MAKE IT EASIER TO CONNECT MULTIPLE DEVICES AND ACCESS OR CHANGE THEM NEED TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THINGS WHEN STOPPED IN DRIVE NOT JUST WHEN CAR IS OFF OR STOPPED AND IN DRIVE 
THEY COULD MAKE THE DISPLAY A LITTLE DARKER SO IT WOULD BE EASIER TO SEE WITH SUNGLASSES ON THE SUN VISORS COULD ADD SOME WIDTH FOR EVENING AND MORNING SUN 
THEY COULD NOT HAVE MADE THE USE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ANY MORE CUMBERSOME AND UNATTRACTIVE EVEN IF TRIED THE MAP IS VERY BASIC WITH VERY FEW STREETS MARKED IN ANY SCALE MARKING STREET NAMES IS CONFUSING AND YOU REALLY DO 
THEY COULD PUT THE TV SCREEN IN EACH OF THE HEAD REST RATHER THAN ONE SMALL SCREEN IN THE CENTER OF THE VEHICLE
THEY COULD USE BETTER QUALITY SPEAKERS 
THEY DON T WORK CONSISTENTLY
THEY LET THE JAPANESE PROGRAM CELL PHONE NAMES AND NUMBERS ARE LOADED AND ALPHATABETIZED BY FIRST NAMES MAKING IT HARD TOLOCATE PEOPLE DOES T ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE 
THEY MADE THE WINDOW TO SMALL IN THE FRONT DOORS WHICH MAKE THE DOORS TOO TALL IF YOU DRIVE UP TO A DRIVE UP WINDOW YOU CAN T REACH OVER THE DOOR BECAUSE IT IS TOO HIGH IT IS THAT WAY FOR ME AND MY FATHER IN TURN MAKES IT HARD TO SEE OUT THE S 
THEY NEED TO ACTIVATE VOICE CONTROL ON CONVERTIBLES IT IS NOT SAFE LOOKING DOWN TO USE THE KNOB TO TYPE IN INFO FOR THE SYSTEM YOU ARE TRYING TO USE LEXUS CONVERTIBLES YOU CAN USE VOICE COMMANDS AND IT WORKS FINE 
THEY NEED TO ADD MORE INTERNET APPLICATIONS THEY CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORT GOOGLE SEARCH 
THEY NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC SOMETIMES THEY DON T UNDERSTAND MY COMMAND 
THEY NEED TO PUT A REAR CAMERA & A CHANGE LANE CAMERA ON XTERRA S
THEY NEED TO PUT DUAL VISORS IN THIS TRUCK 
THEY NEED TO SORT OUT IPHONE INTEGRATION USB AND BT MODES ARE INCOMPATIBLE AND CONFUSE THE SYSTEM SUCH THAT NEITHER WILL WORK CORRECTLY WHEN I SAW THAT THE STOCK HEAD UNIT CAME WITH A USB PORT I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC THROUG 
THEY RE ARE A COUPLE OF REALLY BAD BLIND SPOT AT THE REAR AND TO CHANGE LINES BUT THE VEHICLE RESPONDES NICELY 
THEY SHOULD CHANGE THE NAVIGATION TO GARMIN 
THEY SHOULD HAVE OFFERED IT TO ME
THEY SHOULD JUST HAVE ALL SEASON TIRES ON STEAD OF SUMMER TIRES
THEY SHOULD UPDATE HIGH END SYSTEMS TO BE MORE INTERACTIVE WITH PHONE APPS LIKE TEXT MESSAGES THROUGH THE AUDIO/ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM 
THEY USED TO HAVE AN INTERNAL HARD DRIVE THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS ANYMORE 
THEY WORK REALLY WELL
THHE SUN VISORS NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB BLOCKING THE SUN BEHIND THE MIRROR 
THICK A PILLARS
THICK A PILLARS 
THICK A PILLARS OBSTRUCT VIEW SMALL REAR WINDOW OBSTRUCTS VIEW 
THICK A PILLARS SOMETIMES GET IN THE WAY HARD TO SEE TO THE REAR DUE TO THE CROSSBAR IN THE HATCH 
THICKNESS OF PILLARS BETWEEN FRONT WINDSHIELD AND FRONT SIDE WINDOWS CAUSES A BLIND SPOT
THIN PAINT ON BUMPER
THINGS ARE PRETTY GOOD!
THINGS COULD BE SIMPLIFIED LAST WEEK I HAD TO RESER THE CLOCK FOR DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME I HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING TO THE CLOCK SETTING MENU THE HOW TO FOR THIS SIMPLE NEED IS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THE OWNER S MANUAL!!! THIS CAR WOULD BENEFIT 
THINGS ROLE OUT OF CAR WHEN THE HATCH IS OPEN 
THINK ABOUT ADDING THE CURVED MIRRORS ON EITHER SIDE TO ELIMINATE NOT SEEING VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOTS
THINK BOTH THE SOUND AND PHONE SYSTEMS WORK GREAT 
THINK BY NOW YOU GET THE FEELING I LOVE MY ALTIMA! BEST CAR I VE EVER DRIVEN
THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IN A LUXURY SEDAN
THINK ITS HAS ALL THE MODERN TECHNOLOGY YOU COULD ASK FOR
THINK NAVIGATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED
THINK SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SHOULD BE LARGER FLIP DOWN REAR HEAD RESTS OR SOMEHOW MAKE A CLEAR SHOT TO THE REAR VIEW WINDOW!
THINK THAT MY MOST RECENT MODEL HAD BETTER CHANGING LANE VISIBILITY THAN PREVIOUS BUT IM STILL VERY CAUTIOUS
THINK THAT THERE IS TO MANY OPTIONS MAYBE LESS OPTIONS TO MAKE IT SIMPLER 
THINK THE OLDER SYSTEM ON OUR 09 TIGUAN WAS EASIER TO USE 
THINK THE SYSTEM IS VERY UP TO DATE AND MAKES IT VERY EASY TO OPERATE AS LONG AS THE SYSTEM GETS UP DATED YEARLY ETC 
THINNER FRONT WINSHIELD PILLARS 
THIRD AUTO WITH THE SYSTEM AND IT GETS BETTER EVERY TIME
THIRD ROW
THIRD ROW AND 2ND ROW CAPTAIN SEATS
THIRD ROW HEADREST MAKE A BLIND SPOT FOR ME
THIRD ROW HEADRESTS IMPAIR VISIBILITY 
THIRD ROW NEEDS MORE SPEAKER
THIRD ROW SEAT
THIRD ROW SEAT ACCESS
THIRD ROW SEAT HEAD REST HAS NO INTERMEDIATE POSITION THEY ARE EITHER FULL UP OR FULL DOWN 
THIRD ROW SEAT HEADRESTS REDUCES REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY 
THIRD ROW SEATING
THIRD ROW WINDOWS TOO SMALL SHOULD HAVE LEFT THEM THE WAY THEY WERE IN PREVIOUS GENERATION 
THIRD SEAT COMFORTABILITY OF SEATS
THIS 2015 ESCAPE IS HARDER TO SWITCH LANES THAN MY OLD 2008 ESCAPE I DO NOT FEEL THE VISIBILITY IS THE SME
THIS 2015 GENESIS WHO S TRULY SUBSTANTIAL! I FEEL COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY SAFETY AS I DRIVE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A HEAVY VEHICLE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BIT MORE POWER IN THE ENGINE 
THIS 2015 HIGHLANDER IS EASIER TO SEE OUT OF THAN MY PREVIOUS 2009 HIGHLANDER 
THIS 2015 INFINITI Q70 IS THE SAFEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED MY PREVIOUS 2002 I35 WAS THE SECOND SAFEST CAR THAT I HAVE OWNED MY PREVIOUS CARS WERE NISSAN MAXIM AND A 71 VW BUG WHICH I STILL OWN 
THIS 911 IS AMAZING AND FEELS VERY SAFE
THIS ALREADY WAS UPGRADED FROM MY 2012 MODEL
THIS ASPECT OF THE CAR IS QUITE EXCELLENT 
THIS AUDIO SYSTEM HAS A SUB WOOFER AND CENTER CHANNEL WITH NO WAY TO CONTROL HOW MUCH POWER THEY RECEIVE
THIS CAR DID NOT COME WITH DAY LIGHTS WHICH DISAPPOINTED ME A LOT LOOKING FOR A SET OF AFTER MARKET DLR S THAT WON T DAMAGE THE CAR I THINK DLR S SHOULD BE A MUST ON ALL CAR AND TRUCKS!
THIS CAR DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF THE TRADITIONAL BLIND SPOTS THAT MOST SPORTS CARS DO THE REAR PASSENGER WINDOWS ARE ACTUALLY USEFUL FOR SEEING INTO YOUR BLIND SPOT A LOT OF THE SAFETY OF THIS CAR IS IN HOW WELL IT HANDLES 
THIS CAR DOES NOT HAVE AN MP3 AUDIO JACK AND ONLY 1 USB PORT I WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE ONE OF EACH OR 2 USB PORTS LOCATION OF PORTS INSIDE THE ARM REST IS INCONVENIENT 
THIS CAR DOES NOT HAVE BUILT IN NAVIGATION FEATURE 
THIS CAR DOES WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT IT TO I LOVE IT! WE TRADED IN OUT 2012 TAURUS BECAUSE OF VISIBILITY PROBLEMS NO PROBLEMS NOW!
THIS CAR FEELS REALLY SOLIDLY PLANTED ON THE ROAD 
THIS CAR FEELS ROCK SOLID AND SAFE WHEN DRIVING BUT IS STILL VERY ENJOYABLE TO DRIVE IT HAS GREAT SIGHTLINES THAT MAKE IT FEEL SMALLER WHEN PARKING OR MANEUVERING IN A SMALLER SPACE 
THIS CAR FEELS STURDY AND SAFE MORE SO THAN ITS OUTWARD APPEARANCE WOULD SUGGEST 
THIS CAR GIVES ME A FEELING OF SAFETY BECAUSE OF THE VISIBILITY
THIS CAR HANDLES ADVERSE ROAD CONDITIONS IN INCLEMENT WEATHER LIKES NOTHING WE VE EVER EXPERIENCED IT IMPARTS SUCH A FEELING OF QUIET SECURE SAFETY AND CONTROL AT ALL TIMES THAT WE LL BE HARD PRESSED TO EVER SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS IN THE FUTU 
THIS CAR HAS A TRULY EXCEPTIONAL SOUND SYSTEM
THIS CAR HAS BIG BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES BUT I LIKE THE CAR IT S MY SECOND ONE AND I M USED TO IT I STILL WISH IT WAS BETTER
THIS CAR HAS BLIND SPOTS THE SIZE OF ALASKA LEFT SIDE PILLAR BLOCKS SIGHT WHEN LOOKING OVER LEFT SHOULDER LEFT FRONT PILLAR BLOCKS SIGHT WHEN MAKING LEFT TURNS RIGHT REAR WINDOW PILLAR BLOCKS VIEW OF CARS TO THE RIGHT REAR WINDOW IS TINY AND T 
THIS CAR HAS BY FAR THE MOST AMAZING SOUNDING AUDIO I VE EVER HEARD IN A VEHICLE 
THIS CAR HAS EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY 
THIS CAR HAS LITTLE BLIND SPOTS I LIKE BEING ABLE TO SEE ALL AROUND ME 
THIS CAR HAS MAJOR BLIND SPOTS BUT IT S NO ISSUE WITH THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM I VE HAD TO RELY ON THIS SYSTEM IN TRAFFIC 
THIS CAR HAS THE MOST SAFETY TECHNOLOGY AND FEATURES OF ANY CAR I HAVE OWNED 
THIS CAR IS A FANTASTIC VALUE!!!
THIS CAR IS EXCEPTIONAL!
THIS CAR IS GREAT
THIS CAR IS NOT HEAVY IT SWAYS WITH THE WIND WHEN YOU RE DRIVING ON THE EXPRESSWAY WHEN I HAD MY BMW IT WAS VERY HEAVY AND IT DIDNT SWAY AT ALL I BELIEVE HAD I NOT DRIVEN A BMW FOR 5 YEARS BEFORE PURCHASING THE KIA I WOULD VE KNOWN THE DIFFERE 
THIS CAR IS SOLID AS A ROCK!
THIS CAR IS THE BEST BUILT AND MOST SOLID CAR THAT I HAVE EVER OWNED I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THIS CAR AT ALL TIMES MY WIFE FEELS THE SAME WAY AS WELL I LOVE DRIVING IN SNOW ALWAYS HAVE NOW MY WIFE HAS NO PROBLEMS DRIVING IN SNOW AS WELL CHI 
THIS CAR IS THE FIRST ONE THAT I HAVE OWNED THAT MAKES ME FEEL SAFE AND CONFIDENT WHEN I DRIVE I DO NOT HAVE TO TRY HARD TO DRIVE IT WELL 
THIS CAR IS THE GREATEST EVER!!!!! I LOVE IT!!! WISH I WOULD HAVE GOT THE BACK UP CAMERA OPTION THOUGH 
THIS CAR IS THE SAFEST CAR OUT THERE! SERIOUSLY HAS SAVED ME AND MY KIDS FROM MANY ACCIDENTS ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE BLIND SPOT I LOVE MY GENESIS!
THIS CAR IS TO LOW TO THE GROUND ITS FEELS AS YOU IN A TIN CAN NOT STABLE NOT MUCH THOUGHT PUT IN THIS CAR COST TO MUCH FOR THE MONEY I CAN SEE BUT IT STILL FEELS AS I AM IN A HOLE WHEN OTHER CARS PASS ME I FEEL THAT THEY CAN NOT SEE ME DO NO 
THIS CAR IS VERY EASY TO DRIVE YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY 
THIS CAR IS VERY WELL DESIGNED MINIMAL BLIND SPOTS 
THIS CAR KEPT MY SON SAFE WHEN DRIVING IN AN UNEXPECTED SNOW STORM WHILE NUMEROUS OTHER VEHICLES WERE INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS 
THIS CAR MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT I LOVE IT AND IT IS PERFECT FOR ME! THE RIDE IS AMAZING I AM OLDER AND GET TIRED EASILY SO A GOOD RIDE ON A LONG TRIP IS A MAJOR PLUS! I HAVE OWNED A NEW FORD FOCUS HB A NEW MAZDA6 AND A KIA SEDONA NONE COMPAR 
THIS CAR OFFERS WHAT MY LAST CAR DIDN T GREAT VISIBILITY FROM THE ALL AREAS 
THIS CAR RUNS ON ICE LIKE IT IS ON RAILS 
THIS CAR SEEMS TO HAVE A LARGER BLIND SPOT THAN MOST VEHICLES WHEN SLOWING TO ALLOW OTHER LANES TO MERGE IT IS VERY EASY TO LOSE THE CAR FROM MIRRORS AND HAVE TO CRANE YOUR NECK TO FIND THEM 
THIS CAR TO NEW
THIS CAR VISIBILTY IS BEST WHEN CHANGING LINE AND TURN LEFT
THIS CARE SPEAKS FOR ITSELF 
THIS CARS REDESIGN HAS VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED A BLIND SPOT 
THIS COUL BE IMPROVED
THIS HAS BEEN AN AWESOME FEATURE I CAN CALL FAMILY WHILE IN TRAFFIC AND NEVER TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD 
THIS HAS TRULY BEEN A SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR ME IN FACE I HAD A COLLISION WITHIN ONE WEEK OF DRIVING MY NEW COROLLA BECAUSE IT IS SO HARD TO SEE OTHER CARS WITH THE NEW DESIGN DANGEROUS 
THIS IS A 2015 VEHICLE AND THERE IS A BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTION BUT NO BLUETOOTH AUDIO CONNECTION THE ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THIS CAR!!!!!!!!!!!
THIS IS A AWESOME VEHICLE I PUT 6000 MILES ON THIS VEHICLE WITH ALL FOUR SEASONS OF WEATHER AND IT PERFORMED FLAWLESSLY GREAT FUEL MILEAGE VERY COMFORTABLE INSIDE WAS QUITE DURING MY TRIP FROM OUTSIDE NOISE HANDLING WAS AWESOME HAD TO DRIVE 150 MI 
THIS IS A BASIC CAR I DID NOT PAY FOR UPGRADES BUT THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE REALLY TOOOO SMALL 
THIS IS A CAR I SHOULD BE DRIVING AND ONLY DRIVING MUSIC IS OKAY OTHERWISE I DO NOT NEED NOR CARE TO HAVE OTHER COMS NAVIGATION OR ENTERTAINMENT THOSE SHOULD JUST BE REMOVED TO ALLOW MORE SPACE FOR THE DRIVER AND TO BE ABLE TO SEE 
THIS IS A CAR YES? IT IS NOT AN OFFICE OR A PHONE BOOTH OR A DEN IT IS TRANSPORTATION PERIOD 
THIS IS A COMPLAINT I HAVE WITH MOST CARS TODAY THE FRAME CREATES TOO LARGE A BLIND SPOT MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN TURNING IN HONOLULU ROADS ARE MORE CONDENSED SO THERE ARE MORE OBSTACLES THAN MOST MAINLAND DRIVING LOCATIONS 
THIS IS A CONVERTIBLE AND THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SYSTEM IS TOO LOW ON INTESTATES
THIS IS A DISLIKE I HAVE OWN A 2013 SOUL AND HAVE OWNED A 2013 SORENTO NOW THE 2015 SORENTO SEEMS THAT EACH VEHICLES SOFTWARE FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT SO IT TAKES GETTING USED TO WHEN IN THE DIFFERENT VEHICLE 
THIS IS A DOWNER NOT AS EASY TO USE AS OTHERS AND CHEAP MATERIALS NISSAN CAN IMPROVE HERE
THIS IS A FANTASTIC VEHICLE I AM BLESSED TO OWN IT 
THIS IS A GOOD SYSTEM BUT I HATE NOT HAVING MORE ACTUAL MECHANICAL BUTTONS FOR FEATURES THIS IS THE MAIN REASON WE BOUGHT THE SUBURBAN OVER THE ESCALADE I HATE TOUCH SCREEN VIRTUAL BUTTONS 
THIS IS A GREAT CAR 
THIS IS A GREAT CAR I LOVE IT
THIS IS A GREAT CAR TO DRIVE 
THIS IS A GREAT DRIVING VEHICLE 
THIS IS A GREAT VEHICLE FIT AND FINISH EXCEPTIONAL
THIS IS A GT 3 AND THE REAR WING CREATES VISIBILITY ISSUES NEEDED A REAR CAMERA 
THIS IS A HEAD TURNING CAR
THIS IS A HIGH TECH AND SAFE CAR AND I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT WHEN MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER DRIVES IT!
THIS IS A LOWER END AUDIO UNIT AND I DID NOT EXPECT MUCH I GOT WHAT I PAID FOR 
THIS IS A NEW FEATURE FOR ME FIRST TIME FOR ANY CAR I VE OWNED SO IT IS ALL VERY ENJOYABLE TO ME
THIS IS A SMALL VEHICLE I DON T FEEL AS SAFE IN IT AS I DID WITH MY FULL SIZE VAN THAT WAS EXTRA HEAVY V 8 BUT IT IS MORE ECONOMICAL TO OPERATE IT DOESN T MAKEUP FOR HAVING TO MAKE PAYMENTS BUT ALL IN ALL IT IS A NEWER VEHICLE THE LITTLE 
THIS IS A SMALLER CAR THAN I AM USED TO BUT IT IS VERY GOOD OVERALL 
THIS IS A SOLID CAR WITH ALL OF THE LATEST SAFETY FEATURES I FRONT AND REAR BACK UP CAMERA WOULD BE NICE BUT NOT EXPECTED DUE TO THE WEIGHT SAVINGS PORSCHE EMPHASIZES ON THE GT3 VERSION OF THE 911 I SUPPOSE ONE COULD GET A 911 TURBO OR TURBO 
THIS IS A SOLID WELL PUT TOGETHER VEHICLE THAT RIDES FABULOUS 
THIS IS A SUGGESTION THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES I HAVE WISHED FOR A ONE TOUCH MUTE BUTTON I E WHEN THE CD IS PLAYING AND I STOP TO TALK TO A BANK TELLER GETTING THE VOLUME DOWN BY HOLDING OR PRESSING THE VOLUME BUTTON ACTUALLY TAKES A C 
THIS IS A SUPER SAFE VEHICLE AND FEELS SAFE WE HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN SO THIS WAS A MUST WHEN PURCHASING OUR NEW VEHICLE AND WE COULDN T BE HAPPIER 
THIS IS A VERY LONG SURVEY AND I M GETTING TIRED!
THIS IS A VERY NICE VEHICLE
THIS IS A VERY SMOOTH SUV THAT HANDLES GREAT GOOD POWER WITH GREAT VISIBILITY 
THIS IS A VERY STABLE CAR I FEEL VERY SAFE WHEN DRIVING 
THIS IS A WELL ENGINEERED VEHICLE THAT WITH A FEW ATTENTION TO MINOR ISSUES WILL BECOME THE STANDARD FOR OTHERS TO MIMIC 
THIS IS ACTUALLY MY SECOND 2015 MAZDA 6 I RECENTLY WAS INVOLVED IN A WRECK THAT TOTALED MY FIRST ONE THAT VEHICLE DID A GREAT JOB OF PROTECTING ME DURING THE ACCIDENT I WAS ABLE TO WALK AWAY WITHOUT A SCRATCH AFTER A COLLISION AT 50 55 MPH I C 
THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING CAR
THIS IS AN AMAZING CAR HAS THE FEEL OF A LUXURY SUV IN A PACKAGE THAT COSTS $10K LESS THAN SIMILARLY EQUIPPED AND SIZED VEHICLES AMAZING JOB ON FIT FINISH SAFETY AND VALUE
THIS IS AN AREA OF CONCERN IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE BACK AND TO THE BACK SIDES THEY MADE THE SIDE MIRRORS SMALLER FROM THE PREVIOUS MODEL SUBURBANS AND THE BACK SEATS CAUSE A BIT OF OBSTRUCTION FROM THE VIEW LOOKING BACK 
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT ROAD CAR
THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL AUTOMOBILE!!!!
THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL VEHICLE
THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONAL VEHICLE FOR ANYONE WHO SPENDS A LOT OF TIME ON THE ROAD FEEL TOTALLY SAFE 
THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY WELL BALANCED VEHICLE 
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY WELL CONSTRUCTED SUV TOUGH RELIABLE APPROPRIATELY STYLISH EASY TO DRIVE SOLID SAFE AND A GREAT VALUE BEST VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED FOR DRIVING ON SNOW AND ICE LOVE THE NEW BACK UP CAMERA!
THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING SYSTEM HOW EVER I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT THE SYSTEM DOESN T HAVE A BUILT IN CD PLAYER 
THIS IS CLEARLY THE GREATEST WEAKNESS OF THE R SPEC REAR VISIBILITY ISN T THAT GREAT AND THE C PILLAR ON THE RIGHT IS LARGE ENOUGH THAT IT WILL LITERALLY CREATE A HUGE BLINDSPOT TWO LANES TO THE RIGHT OF THE VEHICLE AND NEITHER MIRRORS NOR LOOKI 
THIS IS DIFFERENT EACH TIME I VE USED THE WIPERS BUT VERY OFTEN ONE BLADE SPLASHES SOME WATER TO THE OTHER SIDE AFTER THAT WIPER HAS PASSED 
THIS IS FIRST CAR I VE HAD WITH ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY LAST CAR WAS 2002 TAURUS LOVE THE HANDS FREE OPTIONS IN ALL AREAS 
THIS IS FIRST CAR TO HAVE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY IT S GREAT!
THIS IS FIRST TIME TO HAVE THE BACK UP CAMERA AND ALERT SYSTEM I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS DEVICE 
THIS IS HARD FOR ME TO RATE AS I HAVE YET TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM !!!! IT IS VERY CONFUSING AND I WILL HAVE TO ASK THEM TO SHOW ME AGAIN HOW TO USE IT THE QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT ESPECIALLY WITH THE HANDS 
THIS IS HARD FOR ME TO RATE SINCE I DON T KNOW HOW TO OPERATE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO CONNECT THE IPOD I WISH THE SOUND WAS BETTER AND CLEARER 
THIS IS IN COMPARISON TO MY OLD 98 HONDA ODYSSEY WHICH HAD SUPER WONDERFUL VISABILITY 
THIS IS LARGER TRUCK THAN I AM USED TO DRIVING AND THE TAILGATE IS HIGHER THAN THE SMALLER RANGER I HAVE BEEN DRIVING SO BACKING UP IS MORE OF A TASK THAN I HAD WITH THE RANGER BUT IT IS A LARGER TRUCK AND I AM GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO IT 
THIS IS LIKELY MY OWN SHORTFALL THE DAY I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE MY DEALER SHOWED ME HOW TO SET THE TOUCH SENSITIVE RADIO BUTTONS TO SPEED DIAL MY CONTACTS HOWEVER I M NOW UNABLE TO RESET THE BUTTONS OR USE THEM FOR THE RADIO AS SOON AS I TOU 
THIS IS MINOR THE LEFT SIDE DRIVER S DOOR MIRROR LIMITS VISIBILITY VIEW WHEN I AM MAKING A LEFT TURN STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF I NEED TO ADJUST MY SEAT DIFFERENTLY TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS
THIS IS MY 3RD MURANO SO AS YOU CAN TELL I AM A FAN! THE REAR TAILLIGHT/BACKUP LIGHT DESIGN AND PLACEMENT OF THE BACK UP CAMERA HAS BY FAR BEEN THE BEST IN THE 2009 MURANO WHEN I BOUGHT THE 2013 I WAS SO SURPRISED BY THE TERRIBLE GLARE FROM EI 
THIS IS MY 4TH BEETLE AND I ENJOY DRIVING IT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD AND OTHER VEHICLES THAT THE CAR PROVIDES IT IS EASY TO DRIVE AND I FEEL SAFE IN THE CAR 
THIS IS MY 4TH TAURUS AND I REALLY TRUST IN THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE
THIS IS MY 5TH PILOT SO THERE ARE REASONS I KEEP COMING BACK FOR ANOTHER I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PILOT EXCEPT THAT THE TIRES THAT COME ON THE CAR ARE SUBSTANDARD IN THAT THEY ONLY LAST ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE WE HAVE TO PUT MONEY INTO NEW ONES 
THIS IS MY 6TH ALTIMA AND THE BEST SO FAR
THIS IS MY 8TH VOLVO I WOULD NOT DRIVE ANYTHING ELSE!

THIS IS NOT THE NORMAL TYPE OF QUESTIONNAIRE THAT YOU USUALLY DO THIS IS ONE THAT I WON T RESPOND TO IF YOU MAKE IT SO LONG AND INVOLVED A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO REALLY ANSWER PROPERLY
THIS IS ONE OF MY TWO BIGGEST IMPROVEMENTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WITH THIS VEHICLE BLIND SITE ON THE MIRROR IS GREAT BUT THEY NEED TO INCORPORATE A WARNING SOUND WHEN YOUR FLASHERS ARE ON AND THERE IS A VEHICLE IN YOUR BLIND SITE MY PREVIOU 
THIS IS OUR 2ND OPTIMA THE FIRST WAS TOTALED WITH 14OO MILES ON IT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS TOTALED THE AIR BAG DEPLOYED AND MY HUSBAND WALKED AWAY FROM THE ACCIDENT WITH MINOR INJURIES THIS IS WHY WE REPLACED I WITH A 2015 OPTIMA

THIS IS OUR FIRST BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAVING THE MAP AVAILABLE WITH THE ABILITY TO ZOOM IN AND OUT IS GREAT AND USED FREQUENTLY
THIS IS OUR FIRST VEHICLE WITH TOUCH SCREEN AND SATELLITE RADIO WE MAY GET IT IN OUR OLDER VEHICLES WE LOVE IT SO MUCH IT WILL BE A REQUIREMENT IN FUTURE VEHICLES!

THIS IS OUR THIRD GL450 AND IT IS THE BEST YET AN OUTSTANDING VEHICLE 
THIS IS PROBABLY A PROBLEM AT MY END BUT EVERY TIME I USE VOICE RECOGNITION TO CALL A CONTACT FROM MY CONTACTS LIST THE SYSTEM SHOWS THE PHONE NUMBER TWICE AND THEN ASKS ME WHICH ONE I WANT TO CALL AS IF IT DOUBLE COPIED MY CONTACT LIST 
THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONE CATEGORY BMW SHOULD INVEST MORE TIME/MONEY INTO AS MENTIONED IN EARLIER COMMENTS BMW SHOULD MOVE AT THE SPEED OF TECHNOLOGY WITH ADVANCEMENTS IN CAR TECHNOLOGY/COMPUTER SYSTEMS IT SHOULD BE EASY TO SET UP FLASHABLE UPD 
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FULLY LOADED VEHICLE BUT IT DOESNT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO SYNC/PAIR MY CELL PHONE IT SAID BLUETOOTH CAPATABLE BUT I WAS TOLD THATS THE SATILITE RADIO THIS IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SECTION OF MY

THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDING FACTORY STEREO I HAVE EVER HEARD 
THIS IS THE COOLEST TRUCK I EVER HAD AND I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!
THIS IS THE DESIGN OF THE CAR SO NOTHING UNEXPECTED IN MY RATINGS THE ENGINE IS SO POWERFUL YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL THAT IS THE MAIN ADVANTAGE / DISADVANTAGE OF THE CAR
THIS IS THE FIRST AUTO WE OWNED WITH ALL THESE FEATURES SO I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO 
THIS IS THE FIRST CAR I VE DRIVEN THAT I M ABLE TO EASILY CONNECT MY PHONE THROUGH BLUETOOTH AND LISTEN TO MY MUSIC

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAD NAVIGATION AND TOUCH SCREEN AUDIO AND I LOVE IT!
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME OWNING A FORD TRUCK AND I LOVE IT 
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE HAD A VEHICLE THAT WARNS ME IF THERE IS A VEHICLE IN MY BLIND SPOT AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A SILLY NEW IDIOT LIGHT BUT AFTER HAVING DRIVEN THE CAR I DO NOT WANT A CAR WITHOUT THIS FEATURE IN THE FUTURE 
THIS IS THE FIRST TOUCH SCREEN RADIO I VE USED AND I TRULY ENJOY IT IT S EASY TO USE AND SWITCH FROM ONE SOURCE TO ANOTHER VERY GLAD I OPTED FOR THIS RADIO IT S TRULY A GREAT VALUE FOR THE EXTRA $200 
THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED IN A WHILE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE MIRROR MOUNTED LED TURN INDICATORS THIS FEATURE IMPROVES VISIBILITY FOR OTHERS TO SEE THE CAR TURNING AND IMPROVES SAFETY WHEN TURNING DISAPPOINTED IT IS NOT A FEATURE ON 
THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED THAT HAS BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL 
THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED WITH A NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND ALTHOUGH I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD NEED ONE OR ENJOY IT SO MUCH I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE SYSTEM OF COURSE I LOVE THE SOUND SYSTEM 
THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE I VE HAD WITH A TOUCH SCREEN RADIO SO INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY COOL AFTER USING IT A BIT THOUGH THERE ARE SOME SHORTCOMINGS TO GET AN APPRECIATION OF THIS COMPARE THE TOUCHSCREEN SYSTEM TO AN ANDROID SMART 
THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE WHERE I HAVE BLUETOOTH AND I M LOVING IT 
THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE WITH THIS SYSTEM
THIS IS THE FOURTH M B CAR I VE PURCHASED IN THE PAST 10 YEARS AND BASED ON THE HORRIBLE NAVIGATION AND AUDIO SYSTEM ON THE 2015 C 350 IT MAY BE THE LAST M B VEHICLE I PURCHASE WHAT USED TO TAKE ONLY ONE OR TWO STEPS TO PROGRAM AND OPERATE FOR 
THIS IS THE LARGEST VEHICLE ON THE ROAD I FEEL THIS IS THE SAFEST VEHICLE ANYONE CAN RIDE IN 
THIS IS THE LEAST SATISFYING ASPECT OF THE CAR I THINK A SUBWOOFER COULD ADD A LOT TO THE CARS OTHERWISE DECENT SOUND SYSTEM COMPARITIVELY SPEAKING I AM MORE IMPRESSED WITH THE ACURA TL AUDIO SYSTEM THAT STATED I DID NOT BUY AN S4 FOR AUDIO I 
THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED AND I HAVE OWNED A LOT OF CARS FROM CORVETTES TO AN AUDI TT AND EVEN A PORSCHE THIS CR Z IS A TRUE SPORTS CAR THAT IS FUN TO DRIVE WITH PLENTY OF ROOM FOR WHEN WE GO SHOPPING AT COSTCO AND IT GE 
THIS IS THE ONE CAR WE TEST DROVE THAT HAD THE MOST WINDOW SPACE WE FELT THAT WE COULD REALLY SEE ALL AROUND THE CAR!
THIS IS THE ONE COMPLAINT I HAVE WITH MY NEW PRIUS IT SEEMS THAT THE VISIBILITY OF VEHICLES BOTH BEHIND ME AND TO THE RIGHT REAR OF ME IS FAR WORSE THAN MY PREVIOUS 2007 PRIUS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL AND I AM CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING IT TO 
THIS IS THE POINT IN THE SURVEY WHERE IT HAS GONE ON TOO LONG 
THIS IS THE SAFEST THAT I HAVE EVER FELT IN AN AUTOMOBILE!
THIS IS THE SINGLE WORST PART OF THE CAR THE SYSTEM IS NON INTUITIVE AND FRUSTRATING TO USE MAYBE 10 YEARS AGO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OK BUT WHEN I HAVE BEEN USING AN IPHONE SINCE 2007 IT IS JUST FRUSTRATING PORSCHE NEEDS TO HIRE APPLE TO HELP 
THIS IS THE WEAKEST PART OF THE VEHICLE IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT UP TO PAR WITH THE OTHER CLASS LEADING PARTS OF THE VEHICLE LIKE THE LIGHTING INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR DESIGN 
THIS IS TOO LONG OF A QUESTIONNAIRE WHERE ARE THE DRINKS! BUT I DO JUST LOVE THIS MKC 
THIS IS TRULY AN EXCEPTIONAL CAR I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT!
THIS IS TRULY AN EXCEPTIONAL VEHICLE
THIS IS WHY I CHOSE THE CAR SUPERIOR VISIBILITY TO MOST NEW MODELS
THIS IS WHY WE BOUGHT THE SUBARU THE FIRST WE HAVE EVER OWNED 
THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE SAFEST FEELING CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN WE DO A LOT OF HIGHWAY DRIVING LONG DISTANCE AND NOT ONCE HAVE I BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT MY FAMILY S SAFETY
THIS LITTLE CAR HAS BY FAR SOME OF THE BEST LIGHTING FEATURES I HAVE EXPERIENCED OUT OF ALL MY CARS 
THIS MAY BE SLIGHTLY OFF TOPIC BUT BY REDUCING CABIN NOISE THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM WOULD IMPROVE PHENOMENALLY IN ADDITION THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS VASTLY DIFFERENT DEPENDING UPON WHICH INPUT YOU USE FOR EX 
THIS MAY NOT BE A FAIR COMPLAINT BUT MY PREVIOUS 2003 DODGE RAM HAD AN AFTERMARKET RADIO WITH A WIRELESS REMOTE TO CHANGE VOLUME & MUSIC TRACKS THE NEW RAM RADIO CONTROL IS ON THE FAR RIGHT OF THE HEAD UNIT AND CHANGING TRACKS IS VERY DIFFICULT A 
THIS MODEL DOES NOT OFFER RAIN SENSING WINDSHIELD WIPERS
THIS MODEL DOESN T GET THE HIGHER GRADE VOICE CONTROLS AND PHONE CONTROLS AS THE X3 THAT S WRONG 
THIS MODEL HAS BETTER BLINDSPOTS THAN THE LAST PATHFINDER I HAD BUT I REALLY LIKE AND NEED THE BLINDSPOT WARNING SYSTEM IT HAS HELPED ME AVOID COLLISIONS 
THIS MODEL IS AN IMPROVEMENT WITH BETTER VISIBILITY RE SIDE MIRRORS LAST LA CROSS I OWNED WAS SO BLOCKED IT WAS DANGEROUS 
THIS MODEL JAG HAS BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY CARS NEXT TO YOU I AM USE TO IT AS I OWNED THE SAME MODEL PREVIOUSLY 
THIS MODEL WITHOUT BLIND SPOT ALERTS WOULD BE A DANGEROUS ASPECT 
THIS NAV SYSTEM NEVER SEEMS TO GET LOST AS I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH OTHER SYSTEMS 
THIS NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ONE FEATURE I REALLY LOVE!
THIS NEW CAR HAS MANY MORE FEATURES THAN ANY OTHER CAR IVE DRIVEN
THIS NEW SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO PLAY OLDER IPODS WITH THE PROVIDED CORD THE OLDER MODEL CARS DO 
THIS NEW VEHICLE HAS MORE TECHNICAL SKILLS THAN ME SO I AM LEARNING 
THIS ONE I THINK IS SAFER THAN THE PREVIOUS MODELS THE OLDER MODELS WERE SMALLER I BOUGHT THIS CAR BASED ON OUR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH AN OLDER MODEL AND BECAUSE IT FEELS BIGGER 
THIS ONE IS THE ONLY PORSCHE WITH PDK THAT FEELS AND DRIVES FOR THE DRIVER I HAD THE PORSCHE 991 TURBO S AND THE PDK WAS MADE FOR AN OLD MAN SO HIS WIFE COULD ALSO DRIVE IT DROVE TERRIBLY AND I LOST 70 000 00 ON HAVING TO TRADE IT IN AFTER O 
THIS PARTICULAR CAR DIDN T COME WITH THE BETTER RADIO OR MAYBE IT IS THE SPEAKERS WE DIDN T REALIZE THERE WOULD BE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE I AM ON THE ROAD A LOT AND LOVE TO LISTEN TO GOOD MUSIC THE SOUND IS JUST NOT THAT GOOD OTHER THAN THA 
THIS PILOT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN OUR 2004 WE TRADED IN STILL GETTING USE TO THE SIZE AND THE VISIBILITY OF THE BIGGER VEHICLE 
THIS QUESTION WAS ANSWERED PREVIOUSLY WHEN ASKED 
THIS QUESTIONAIRE IS WAY TOO LONG!!
THIS QUESTIONNAIRE IS TOOOOOOOOO LONG!!!!!
THIS SHOULD BE A 2 SEATER
THIS SUB ACTS LIKES A SPORTS CAR
THIS SUBARU LEGACY IS AN AWESOME VEHICLE WELL CONSTRUCTED WHICH PROVIDES FOR ENJOYABLE DRIVING EXPERIENCES 
THIS SURVERY
THIS SURVEY
THIS SURVEY CARRIES ON MUCH LONGER THAN DESCRIBED IN YOUR INTRODUCTION LETTER MR O NEILL IF I HAD TO IDENTIFY ONE ASPECT OF COMPUTER SCREEN THE FOUR QUADRANTS TO ACCESS MULTI TECHNOLOGY 
THIS SURVEY IS ENTIRELY TOO LONG 
THIS SURVEY IS GETTING BADD ONLY A MINUTE REALLY PEOPLE

THIS SURVEY IS WAY TOO LONG
THIS SURVEY IS WAY TOO LONG AND IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED 
THIS SURVEY IS WAY TOO LONG FOR $1
THIS SURVEY IS WAY TOO LONG!
THIS SURVEY IS WORTH MUCH MORE THAN $1 00 
THIS SURVEY IT TOO LONG POOR QUALITY 
THIS SYSTEM IS BETTER THAN MOST I VE USED 
THIS SYSTEM IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN MY LAST CAR 
THIS SYSTEM REMINDS ME OF DOS COMPARED TO WINDOWS THE IPHONE IS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE FOR NAVIGATION AND PHONE CALLS I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM 
THIS SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL THE SOUND THAT THE SPEAKERS EMIT ARE WAY BETTER THAN I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE DRIVEN OR RODE IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WORKS FLAWLESSLY 
THIS TAKES TIME TO UNDERSTAND SUGGEST AT LEAST ONE OR TWO MORE ENCORE DELIVERY EVENTS THE FIRST ONE WAS EXCELLENT BUT SYSTEMS ARE COMPLICATED AND REQUIRE MULTIPLE REVIEWS BY AN EXPTET TO GUIDE THROUGH ALL THE LARGE NUMBER OF ELECTRONIC FEATURES
THIS THE MOST MODERN SYSTEM FOR ME I LOVED IT 
THIS TRUCK FEELS SOLID AND CAPABLE ON THE ROAD IT S ALSO THE PERFECT SIZE NOT TOO BIG NOT TOO SMALL 
THIS TRUCK HAS GREAT VISIBILITY ON ALL SIDES
THIS TRUCK IS QUIETER MORE COMFORTABLE AND FEELS SAFER THAN ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED 
THIS TRUCK IS WONDERFUL! DROVE TO FLORIDA AND BACK GREAT RIDE MILEAGE AND A LOT OF COMFORT 
THIS TRUCK S GREAT HEIGHT AND BIG BLACK NOSE MAKE THIS TRUCK HIGHLY VISIBLE FEW PEOPLE VENTURE TO PULL OUT IN FRONT OF ME!
THIS VAN HAS A GOOD SENSE OF ROAD CONNECTION IT IS NOT HARSH NOR IS IT SO SMOOTH THAT WE FEEL ISOLATED IN AN UNSAFE WAY FROM THE ROAD IT IS JUST UTTERLY COMPETENT AND SATISFYING TO OPERATE 
THIS VAN HAS A GREAT SOUND SYSTEM
THIS VEHICLE FEELS AND WORKS SAFELY 
THIS VEHICLE FEELS EXCEPTIONALLY SAFE BEST IN ITS CLASS I WOULD APPRECIATE IF THE DRIVER S SEAT COULD BE ADJUSTED TO A HIGHER POSITION AS I AM OF SHORT STATURE BUT THE THE OVERALL VISIBILITY IS STILL OUTSTANDING ADJUSTABLE FOOT PEDALS WOULD AL 
THIS VEHICLE FEELS LIKE A WELL MADE PIECE OF MACHINERY IT IS A PLEASURE TO DRIVE AND HANDLES WELL THE HEADLIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL NOT ONLY IN STYLE BUT FUNCTION THE RAIN SENSE WINDSHIELD WIPERS NOT ONLY WORK WELL BUT HAVING THE WIPERS AUTOMATICA 
THIS VEHICLE FEELS SAFE AN SOLID WHEN DRIVING IN COLD SNOW COVERED ROAD CONDITIONS BOTH THE ENGINE AND INTERIOR WARM UP QUICKLY AFTER START UP THE DRIVER HASN T EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEM WITH VISIBILITY OR BLIND SPOTS 
THIS VEHICLE FEELS SO SOLID I FEEL TOTALLY PROTECTED 
THIS VEHICLE HAS A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO CHANGE LANES 
THIS VEHICLE HAS A TERRIBLY DANGEROUS BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER SIDE IT NEEDS TO HAVE BLIND SIDE DETECTION OR SOME SORT OF CONVEX MIRROR TO SEE CARS ON THE DRIVER SIDE 
THIS VEHICLE HAS EXCELLENT VISABILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
THIS VEHICLE HAS HUGE BLIND SPOTS WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS THAT ARE BESIDE YOU ON THE HIGHWAY 
THIS VEHICLE HAS IMPROVED THE BLIND SPOT PROBLEM MY MKX WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DETECT CARS ON THE SIDE 
THIS VEHICLE HAS NO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT OR NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND THE RADIO IS OF POOR SOUND QUAILTY
THIS VEHICLE HAS TERRIBLE BLIND SPOTS COMPARED TO MY 2002 F250
THIS VEHICLE HAS VERY BAD BLINDS SPOTS ON EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT FLANK IT S ACTUALLY SCARY I WAS AT A STOP LIGHT AND COULD NOT SEE CARS ON EITHER SIDE I HAVE TO KEEP MY MIRRORS ADJUSTED WAY OUT AND STILL FEEL INSECURE I WILL BUY SOME BLIND SPOT 
THIS VEHICLE IN MY OPINION IS A VERY SAFE VEHICLE TO DRIVE 
THIS VEHICLE INSPIRES CONFIDENCE WHILE DRIVING 
THIS VEHICLE IS A GREAT RIDE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK 
THIS VEHICLE IS A REPLACEMENT FOR ONE THAT WAS TOTALLED WHEN I WAS REAR ENDED BY SOMEONE NOT PAYING ATTENTION I FEEL IF WE HAD BEEN IN A SMALLER VEHICLE THAT WAS NOT DESIGNED AS WELL WE WOULD BE DEAD OR SEVERELY DISABLED YOU COULD LOOK AT MY 
THIS VEHICLE IS SOLID 
THIS VEHICLE IS STILL NEW TO ME ONLY 3 MONTHS AND IT TAKES TIME TO LEARN THE BEST WAY TO WORK WITH ANY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT I M JUST OVER 5FT TALL AND WHEN LOOKING TO SEE IF I CAN PULL OUT IN TRAFFIC WHEN LOOKING TO MY RIGHT THE OUTSIDE MIRROR OR T 
THIS VEHICLE IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL GREAT AUTOMOBILE
THIS VEHICLE IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND I FEEL SAFE ON THE ROAD 
THIS VEHICLE IS VERY SAFE TO DRIVE
THIS VEHICLE IS VERY SAFE! MY REAR BUMPER WAS HIT FROM THE SIDE BY A SPEEDING CAR IN AN INTERSECTION AND I NEVER SAW IT COMING THE BUMPER FLEW OFF I SPUN OUT 180 DEGREES THE WINDOW PASSENGER AIRBAGS DEPLOYED NO PASSENGER MY HEAD SWUNG SIDEW 
THIS VEHICLE MAKES ME FEEL VERY SAFE WHEN I DRIVE IT 
THIS VEHICLE REALLY NEEDS THE HEAD UP DISPLAY
THIS VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE A HIGHER QUALITY AUDIO SYSTEM AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT
THIS VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE ALL WHEEL DRIVE
THIS VEHICLE SITS PERFECTLY ABOVE MOST OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD MAKING FOR HIGH VISIBILITY AT ALL TIMES WITH FEW IF ANY BLIND SPOTS 
THIS VEHICLE STANDS OUT IN TERMS OF REARWARD VISIBILITY WHILE BACKING AND PARKING MOST OTHER VEHICLES WE TESTED FROM THE CURRENT AND RECENT MODEL YEARS WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF WHEN LOOKING REARWARD FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT 
THIS VEHICLE WERE BUILT PROPERLY AND IS SAFE 
THIS VERSION OF THE SYNC SYSTEM SEEMS TO FINALLY HAVE WORKED OUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND COMMANDS MENU MUCH BETTER THAN OUR 2010 FORD EDGE OR OUR 2011 FUSION OR OUR 2008 LINCOLN MKZ I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED STILL THAT FORD DOES NOT SUPPORT TH 
THIS WAS ANOTHER POINT WHERE THE CX 5 BEAT OUT THE COMPETITION I AM 6 1 AND MY WIFE IS 5 3 WE BOTH HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY OUT OF IT COMPARED TO THE MANY OTHERS WE TEST DROVE 
THIS WAS MY FIRST VEHICLE WITH NAVIGATION AND I FOUND IT EASY TO USE LOVE THE CAPABILITY TO LISTEN TO TEXT MESSAGES WITHOUT PULLING OUT MY PHONE I AM ABLE TO SEE IF THE MESSAGE IS IMPORTANT AND WHETHER OR NOT TO REPLY 
THIS WILL BE UPGRADED NEXT YEAR LIKE THE IMPREZA MODEL AND BE MUCH BETTER STILL DOES NOT DETRACT FROM A GREAT CAR
THIS XTERRA IS EASILY MANEUVERABLE IN TIGHT SITUATIONS DRIVER SEATING IS HIGHER THAN MOST CARS ON THE ROAD AROUND YOU AND YOU CAN SEE AHEAD OF THEM TO BETTER ANTICIPATE TRAFFIC ISSUES DOWN THE ROAD AHEAD 
THOSE THICK D PILLARS ARE A BIT TRICKY TO GET USED TO ESPECIALLY IF MOVING FROM A SEDAN OR OTHER VEHICLE WITH A COMPARATIVELY OPEN GREENHOUSE 
THOUGH HAVING A SMALL WINDOW IN THE REAR FROM A HATCHBACK MAKES IT HARD TO SEE SOMETIMES THE SIDE MIRRIORS MAKE UP FOR THAT WITH THEIR GREAT COVERAGE OF THE SURRONDINGS 
THOUGH IT LOOKS NICE THE TOUCH SCREEN CAN BE DISTRACTING WHEN ADJUSTING BASS/TREBLE ETC OR WHEN SELECTING A NEW AUDIO SOURCE LAST AND PROBABLY MOST IRRITATING WHY IS THERE NO DEDICATED KNOB FOR TUNING?
THOUGH THE WIPERS WORK EFFECTIVELY BUT I FELT THAT THE SPACE BETWEEN THE A PILLAR AND THE WINDSHIELD CREATED A POCKET TO TRAP SNOW AND ICE THAT GRADUALLY BUILDS UP AND IMPEDES THE WIPERS ABILITY TO CLEAR THE SNOW AND ICE EFFECTIVELY AFTER A WHILE 
THOUGHT A MID SIZE WOULD BE SMALLER AND EASIER TO PARK THAN A REGULAR TRUCK MY CANYON IS AS BIG AS MANY TRUCKS AND LARGER THAN MOST SUVS 
THOUGHT DRIVER SIDE SUN VISOR A LITTLE TOO WIDE WHEN I DROP IT DOWN I FIND IT DOES BLOCK MY FRONT WINDOW VIEW WHILE DRIVING SO I HAVE TO LEAVE IT ALWAYS AT AN ANGLE 
THREE ARE BLIND SPOTS BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT TO THE REAR OF THE DRIVER WINDSHIELD POSTS ALSO CAUSE A BLIND SPOT ON EACH SIDE LOOKING FORWARD 
THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE BUICK REGAL WITH THE SAME TIRE I HAVE TOLD THAT WHEN THEY HIT AN OBJECT THE SIDE WALL OF THE TIRE BROKE OPEN ALSO CONTROLLING THE FEATURES ON THE DASH BOARD THE RADIO ETC ARE VERY DIFFICULT WHEN SUN IS SHINING ON THE 
THREE QUARTERS VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR DUE TO SMALL REAR WINDOWS
THREE THINGS PERTAINING TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 1 A MORE CLEARLY WRITTEN MANUAL IT NEVER EXPLAINED THAT YOU CAN T USE CERTAIN FEATURES WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN DRIVE 2 THE ONLY WAY TO CANCEL ROUTE GUIDANCE IS THROUGH VOICE CONTROL THERE SH 
THROUGH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD THERE IS SOME GLARE REGARDLESS IF IT IS SUNNY OR NOT FROM THE DASHBOARD
THROUGH THE USB CONNECTING A IPOD IT IS GREAT HAVING EVERYTHING APPEAR ON THE TOUCHSCREEN PLAYLISTS ARTISTS AWESOME EASY TO USE I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE HANDS FREE VOICE RECOGNITION TEXTS GOING TO WRONG PEOPLE CALLING WRONG PEOP 
THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW PUT THE CD RADIO BACK IN
THUMB CONTROL FOR STATION CHANGE 
THX AUDIO IS THE BOMB
THX II CERTIFIED AUDIO SYSTEM HAS INCREDIABLE SOUND
THX PREMIUM AUDIO SYSTEM HAS AMAZINGLY SUPERB QUALITY SOUND WHICH I HAVEN T HEARD IN A CAR SINCE OUR 2003 LINCOLN LS 
THX SAMPLE
THX SOUND QUALITY IS SUPERB 
THX SOUND SYSTEM WITH FULL SURROUND SOUND
TIGHT NIMBLE & HANDLES WELL @ 60 MPH IN AN 30 MPH CURVE TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT ON LEFT SIDE USING MIRRORS OR TURNING HEAD 
TIGHT TUR
TIGHT TURNING RADIUS
TILT THE SCREEN TOWARD THE DRIVER
TIME BLOCKS OUT WHEN TUNING RADIO
TIME CONSUMING TO ENTER INFORMATION INTO NAVIGATION SYSTEM 
TIME NEEDS TO BE HIGHER AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM
TIME OF DAY TOO SMALL AND IN ODD LOCATION
TIN CAN SPEAKERS ARE CHEAP REPLACED ALL SPEAKERS ADDED AMP AND SUB 
TINTED REAR WINDOW DIMINISHES VISIBILITY OF CARS BEHIND 
TINTED TOP WINDSHIELD WOULD BE NICE 
TINTED WINDOWS ARE VERY HELPFUL WHEN DRIVING THROUGH TOWN AT NIGHT LESS INTERFERENCE WITH ALL THOSE NEON LIGHTS
TINTED WINDOWS HARD TO SEE OUT OF AT NIGHT
TINTED WINDOWS SHOULD BE STANDARD AT LEAST THE WINDSHIELD SINCE NOW THE WINDOWS ARE SO LARGE
TINTED WINDOWS WOULD HELP THOSE SITTING IN THE BACK SEATS FROM THE SUN 
TINTED WINDSHIELD WAS NOT AN OPTION AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
TINY LCD SCREEN DURING REVERSE
TINY SIDE MIRRORS!
TINY SUN VISORS
TINY SUN VISORS AND I AM ONLY 60 INCHES TALL SO THEY DO NOT HELP ME MUCH
TIRE AND WHEELS ARE TOO SMALL FOR AN S MODEL
TIRE NOIES
TIRE NOISE
TIRE PRESSURE
TIRE PRESSURE MONITORS
TIRE ROAD NOISE
TIRE TREAD DESIGN NOT AGGRESIVE ENOUGH
TIRED OF HAVING TO ACCEPT NAV SYSTEM TERMS EVERY SINGLE TIME I START THE CAR 
TIRES
TIRES DON T LOOK RIGHT 
TIRES SEEMED A BIT SLIPPERY IN THE SNOW
TIRES SUCK
TIRES SUCK!
TIRES TOO SMALL
TO ACTUALLY HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUILT IN 
TO ADJUST THE BASS MID TREMBLE AND SUB SHOULD BE EASIER THEN HAVING TO GO INTO THE MENU AND TRY TO FIND IT
TO ALLOW PASSENGER TO ENTER NAVIGATION DESTINANTION WHILE VEHICHLE IS MOVING
TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE CHANNELS AND ADJUST SOUND BY USING BUTTONS ON STEERING WHEEL
TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE WHILE DRIVING THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS 
TO BE ABLE TO REVERSE WITHIN AN CD TRACK AND NOT JUST BETWEEN TRACKS 
TO BE ABLE TO SEE 360 DEGREES AROUND THE TRUCK IS EXCELLENT!
TO BE ABLE TO SLIDE PRESET RADIO STATIONS UP OR DOWN SO TO BE ABLE TO ADD A NEW STATION IN BETWEEN TWO ALREADY PRESET ALSO VOICE RECOGNITION CAN BE IMPROVED THE REACTION SPEED OF THE DISPLAY NEEDS TO BE QUICKER TOO SLOW 
TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE RADIO OFF ! I DON T LIKE HAVING TO MUTE THE RADIO EVERY TIME I START THE CAR!
TO BE ABLE TO USE MY CELLPHONE WHILE DRIVING IS A PLUS AND THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC SYSTEMS I AM ABLE TO USE IS SUPERB
TO BE ABLE TO USE THE SYSTEM WITHOUT READING THE MANUAL
TO BE ABLE TO USE YOUR CELLPHONE THROUGH CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL
TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE APPLE IPHONE!!
TO BE EASIER TO OPERATE
TO BE FAIR THE VEHICLE SHAPE LIMITS REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY HOWEVER THE FRONT AND REAR CAMERAS PLUS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING FEATURE OVERCOMES THESE LIMITS WITH EXCELLENT TECHNOLOGY WHICH SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATES INTO THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE 
TO BE FAIR TO VOLVO I HAVEN T HAD FOR VERY LONG AND REALLY HAVEN T SET UP A LOT OF THESE FEATURES YET 
TO BE HONEST I LOVE THE WEATHER FEATURE 
TO CHECK MULTIPLE ROUTES VIA THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BEFORE AND AFTER STARTING A ROUTE 
TO COMPLEX
TO COMPLICATED
TO COMPLICATED 
TO COMPLICATED AND YOU CAN T PLAY AN AUDIO BOOK FROM A DEVICE CONNECTED TO THE USB PORT 
TO COMPLICATED IT S MUCH EASIER TO USE AN IPHONE 
TO COMPLICATED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING 
TO DEVELOP A SIDE SUN VISOR WITHOUT MOVING THE FRONT ONE TO THE SIDE WHILE DRIVING 
TO EFFECTIVELY SEE OUT OF THE VEHICLE I FEEL THAT THE REAR CAMERA AND LANE CHANGING NOTIFICATIONS ARE NECESSARY THERE ARE PRETTY BIG BLIND SPOTS FOR BACKING UP AND CHANGING LANES 
TO EMPLOY SELF PARKING OPTION
TO FAR TO REACH TOUCH SCREEN FROM DRIVERS SEAT BRING THE PANEL OUT A LITTLE MORE
TO GET FM RADIO SONG INFO YOU HAVE TO PRESS 3 BUTTONS! EVERY TIME I SAY GO HOME I HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN HOME AND MOM

TO LONG
TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE PASSENGER TO LOCATE OR CHANGE DIRECTIONS/DESTINATIONS WHILE DRIVING ESPECIALLY ON A LONG TRIP IF THE CAR IS ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT A PASSENGER IS SITTING IN THE SEAT WHICH IT DOES THEN THE PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
TO MAKE IT SIMPLER TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE AFTER READING THE ENTIRE PRINT EDITION OF THE OWNER S MANUAL AND WATCHING MANY OF THE VIDEOS ONLINE I STILL DON T HAVE A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FEATURES MY CAR HAS AND HOW TO USE THEM MUCH TOO COM 
TO MAKE THE CAR MORE QUITE WHEN YOU ARE ON THE PHONE
TO MAKE THE MENUS ACESSIBLE EVEN WHILE DEVICES ARE TRYING TO CONNECT TO BLUETOOTH

TO MY KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN ONLY VIEW 5 POI S ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN GAS BANK FAST FOOD ETC I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A WIDER AVAILABILITY OF VIEW ABLE POI S LIKE MAYBE 10 TO 15 
TO REITERATE THE VEHICLE VISIBILITY IS POOR BECAUSE OF THE THICK PILLARS 
TO SMALL
TO START OUT IT IS SORT OF HARD FOR ME TO SEE AROUND THE VEHICLE I FEEL ITS SO CRAMPED TOGETHER THAT THERES NOT ROOM TO SEE OUT OF THE VEHICLE EXCEPT IN FRONT WHICH HAS THE PLASTIC BARS ON BOTH SIDES WHICH ARE BIGGER THAN THEY NEED TO BE ALSO TH 
TO SYNC A PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH WAS VERY EASY AND PLAYING MUSIC FROM SAID SYNCED PHONE IS VERY SIMPLE AS WELL

TO USE THE REARVIEW MIRROR I HAVE TO BEND MY HEAD DOWNWARD THE BAR ACROSS THE BACK WINDOW LIMITS MY VIEW 
TOCHPAD?
TOGGLE BUTTON NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TOO DIFFICULT TO USE VERY SENSITIVE AND IN A BAD LOCATION 
TOGGLE FROM AM TO FM COULD BE EASIER WOULD LOVE JUST TO LOAD A FAVORITES LIST REGARDLESS OF FREQUENCY?
TONE AND QUALITY OF SOUND 
TONE QUALITY IS VERY GOOD 
TONS OF BAD BLIND SPOTS
TONS OF SPEAKERS AND BUILT IN AMP/SUBS 
TOO BASIC
TOO BIG!
TOO COMPICATED
TOO COMPLEX
TOO COMPLEX AND I M ONLY 49 
TOO COMPLEX NEED TO SIMPLIFY
TOO COMPLEX SYSTEM DOES NOT INTEGRATE WITH SIRI ON MY IPHONE THAT S A SERIOUS FLAW OUR BMW INTEGRATES VERY WELL WITH IPHONES 
TOO COMPLEX TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO OPTIMIZE USE

TOUCHPAD IS VERY SENSITIVE AND HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING LIKE THE SYSTEM IN MY CT200H FOR ENTERTAINMENT
TOUCHSCREEN
TOUCHSCREEN AND VOICE CONTROL CAN BE USED FOR EVERYTHING 
TOUCHSCREEN AUDIO CONTROLS ARE TOO DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN DRIVING WOULD PREFER TRADITIONAL KNOBS AND BUTTONS 
TOUCHSCREEN AUDIO CONTROLS CAN BE MORE INTUITIVE TO USE
TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS ARE CONFUSING 
TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS WOULD BE NICE BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTIVITY EVERYONE SAYS THAT IS SOUNDS LIKE I AM TALKING DOWN A WELL 
TOUCHSCREEN EASE OF USE
TOUCHSCREEN ENTRY
TOUCHSCREEN FOR RADIO PRESELECTS MEANS I HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO PICK A STATION HATE THAT!!
TOUCHSCREEN I LIKE IT BUT TOUCHSCREENS ARE NOW UBIQUITOUS 
TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE
TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE IS SMALL AND RATHER DATED
TOUCHSCREEN IS ALWAYS DIRTY
TOUCHSCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND SEE WHILE DRIVING NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED 
TOUCHSCREEN IS EASY TO NAVIGATE
TOUCHSCREEN IS EXCELLENT
TOUCHSCREEN IS HUGE AND DIFFICULT TO USE 
TOUCHSCREEN IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO USE WHILE DRIVING I PREFER BUTTONS FOR EASY EYES FREE USE MENU SYSTEM FOR AUDIO COULD BE BETTER
TOUCHSCREEN IS OVERLY COMPLICATED AND REQUIRES TOO MANY ACTIONS TO DO A GIVEN TASK CLIMATE AND AUDIO CONTROLS SHOULD HAVE DEDICATED BUTTONS/SWITCHES/KNOBS NAVIGATING THROUGH THE TOUCHSCREEN IS AN EXERCISE IN TECHNOLOGY FOR THE SAKE OF TECHNOLOGY
TOUCHSCREEN MOUSE IS DIFFICULT TO CALIBRATE DISTRACTS FROM DRIVING
TOUCHSCREEN NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
TOUCHSCREEN OPERATION IS NOT USEFUL AS IT REQUIRES A DISTRACTED DRIVING SITUATION CREATED BY THE MANUFACTURER ELIMINATE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS 
TOUCHSCREEN RADIO CONTROLS
TOUCHSCREEN RADIO PRE SET STATION CONTROL HAS TINY RED BARS TO SCROLL THRU THE PRESET SCREENS THESE ARE HARD TO SEE AND TOUCH WHILE DRIVING 
TOUCHSCREEN SYSTEM IS WAY TOO DIFFICULT TO USE I TRULY HATE IT IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME WISH I HADN T LEASED THIS CAR 
TOUCHSCREEN USABILITY AND INTERFACE IS VERY WELL DESIGNED 
TOUCHSCREEN VOICE RECOG 
TOUCHSCREEN WITH BLUETOOTH AND XM
TOUCHSCREENCHANGING OF RADIO CHANNELS AND EASE OF TOUCHSCREEN FOR USE OF PHONE

TOUGH TO HEAR WHEN WINDOWS DOWN AND MOON ROOF OPEN
TOUGH TO JUST FORWARD PARKING WITHOUT FRONT CAMERA ACTIVE REAR CAMERA VISIBILITY IS UNUSABLE AT NIGHT REVERSE LIGHTS AREN T BRIGHT ENOUGH TO ILLUMINATE THE REAR CAMERA VIEW 
TOUGH TO LEARN 
TOUGH TO SEE BLIND SPOTS AND BEHIND YOU IN THIS CAR
TOUGH TO SEE HOW CLOSE THE REAR OF VEHICLE IS WHEN BACKING UP WITHOUT USING BACKUP CAMERA

TOYOTA HAS REALLY IMPROVED THE TOUCHSCREEN AND IT IS FANTASTIC! IT S EASY TO USE AND LOOKS GREAT ADDITIONALLY I LOVE THE NEW FEATURE THEY ADDED IN A BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL THAT I CAN PUSH AND USE TO CONTROL MY PHONE WITHOUT HAVING TO TO 
TOYOTA PRIUS V 2015 IS BEYOND TRULY EXCEPTIONAL IT S MODERN TECHNOLOGY IS BEYOND ANYTHING I VE SEEN OR ENCOUNTERED ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS CAR IS WORTH THE BUY! WITH IT S FINE SEATS AND MODERN TECH AH IN CONCLUSION THIS CAR IS VERY WORTH IT I 
TOYOTA REALLY IMPROVED THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY THE SOUND ON BOTH ENDS OF THE PHONE IS VERY GOOD 
TOYOTA RELIABILITY
TOYOTA SHOULD OFFER A PROGRAM TO NEW OWNERS ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGES ON THEIR CARS WE WERE LEFT TO FIGURE IT OUT ON OUR OWN 
TRACK PAD IS TWITCHY A LITTLE TOO TOUCHY 
TRACTION CONTROL
TRACTION CONTROL SEEMS TO BE VERY AGGRESSIVE BUT IT IS THE FIRST TRUCK I VE OWNED THAT HAS IT 
TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEM
TRACTION ON SNOW AND ICE 
TRADED IN 2012 FIAT FOR THIS 2015 FIAT WAS STRUCK FROM BEHIND IN 2012 FIAT BY VEHICLE GOING 45 MPH VEHICLE WHO STRUCK US WAS TOTALED AND REMOVED FROM SCENE ON FLATBED TOW TRUCK WE DROVE AWAY WITH MINOR DAMAGE AND NO INJURIES FIAT IS BUILT LIKE 
TRADED IN MY ALMOST NEW LEXUS BECAUSE OF POOR VISIBILITY HARD TO TELL HOW CLOSE FRONT FENDER OR REAR BUMPER WAS CLOSE TO SOMETHING HARD TO TELL IF LANE WAS CLEAR TO CHANGE LANES 
TRAFFIC
TRAFFIC ALERT
TRAFFIC ALERT NOTIFICATION WHEN IN HEAVY TRAFFIC ALERTS ARE CONTINUOUS TO THE POINT OF BEING ANNOYING WE KNOW WE ARE IN HEAVY TRAFFIC NEED CONTROL TO TURN OFF IF WE CHOOSE 
TRAFFIC ALERTS
TRAFFIC AND GUIDANCE ON MY SMART PHONE IS SUPERIOR TO THE IN CAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM DURING MY DAILY COMMUTE 
TRAFFIC AND WEATHER ALERTS
TRAFFIC AND WEATHER REQUIRE FM HD OF WHICH THERE ARE NONE IN THIS AREA FOR US THE CELLULAR DATA SOURCE FOR THAT INFORMATION WOULD WORK BUT IT IS NOT AN OPTION 
TRAFFIC AND WEATHER UPDATES
TRAFFIC CONDITIONS AND TRAFFIC ALERTS ARE OUTSTANDING 
TRAFFIC CONGESTION ALERTS
TRAFFIC COULD BE IMPROVED AND WEATHER ADDED
TRAFFIC DOES NOT INTERFACE WITH NAVIGATION
TRAFFIC EN ROUTE
TRAFFIC FEATURES ARE NOT INTUITIVE AND SLOW VOICE RECOGNITION IS USELESS INABILITY TO ADD DESTINATIONS WHILE DRIVING THROUGH VOICE OR PASSENGER IS FRUSTRATING 
TRAFFIC FLOW IS NOT VERY ACCURATE AND NOT EASY TO DISTINGUISH 
TRAFFIC INCIDENTS AND ABILITY TO USE VOICE EFFECTIVELY NEEDS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WOULD REFER TO THE HYUNDAI SONATA 2012 NAVIGATION SYSTEMS AND HOW IT DISPLAYS TRAFFIC INCIDENTS IS FAR SUPERIOR ALTHOUGH PURCHASING THE TRAFFIC MODULE AT $4 00 
TRAFFIC INFO DOES NOT WORK AND THE DEALERSHIP WAS NOT ABLE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM I IMAGINE IF THIS FUNCTION WORKED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE BETTER THAN AVERAGE THE HARDWARE IS RATHER SLOW AND IT TAKES EASILY ALMOST 2 MIN TO TYPE IN 1 FU 
TRAFFIC INFO IS OFTEN INCORRECT OR OUTDATED VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM IS KIND OF TEDIOUS BUT IT WORKS WELL 
TRAFFIC INFO IS TERRIBLE
TRAFFIC INFO NOT ACCURATE ON NAV SYSTEM
TRAFFIC INFO SYSTEM COULD BE MORE ACCURATE AND CURRENT 
TRAFFIC INFO SYSTEM IS SUPERB 
TRAFFIC INFORMATION
TRAFFIC INFORMATION DOES NOT SEEM TO REPORT PROPERLY OR ACCURATELY
TRAFFIC INFORMATION IS USUALLY WRONG I HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE WRONG ADDRESS SEVERAL TIMES BY NAVIGATION
TRAFFIC ON MAP ONLY COVERS MAJOR HIGHWAYS IT SHOULD SECONDARY ROADS ALL ROADS THAT COVER WHAT GOOGLE MAPS COVERS 
TRAFFIC REROUTING AND TIME ESTIMATE IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS INACCURATE GOOGLE MAPS IS MUCH BETTER
TRAFFIC ROUTES ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST GIVEN CURRENT TRAFFIC SITUATIONS 
TRAFFIC UPDATE SLOW DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME AUTO ADJUSTMENT WOULD HELP 
TRAFFIC WARNINGS
TRAFFIC WEATHER ETC ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN MY AREA 
TRAFFIC!

TRAILER BRAKE CONTROL
TRAILER TOW MIRRORS ARE NICE LOOKING BUT NEED TO BE LOWERED OR RE DESIGNED 
TRAILER TOW RATING LIKE TO SEE HIGHER LIKE MY OLD FORESTER OR THE OUTBACK
TRAIN DEALER STAFF ON HOW TO SET UP VOICE COMMANDS I HAVE NO IDEA HOW ITS DONE AND THE DEALER ACTUALLY SAID IT DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL 
TRAIN FOR MULTIPLE VOICE PROFILES
TRAINING AIDS I KNOW IT CAN DO MORE THAN I AM FAMILIAR WITH AND I D PROBABLY USE IT MORE IF I HAD ACCESS TO VIDEOS OR OTHER TRAINING 
TRAINING CLASSES ON HOW TO USE IT
TRAINING LEXUS SHOULD PROVIDE MUCH BETTER TRAINING ON THE USE OF THE COMMUNICAITON AND ENTERTAINMENT FEATURES PRIOR TO LEAVING THE DEALERSHIP THIS IS WORTH A 30 MINUTE REAL TIME TRAINING SESSION ALTERNATIVELY OFFER A CLASS OR PROVIDE A SUCCI 
TRANSFER OF ADDRESS BOOK FROMOLDER STYLE PHONE TO ENTUNE SYSTEM
TRANSITION IN BRAKING FROM REGEN TO MECHANICAL CAN BE DISTURBING AND TOO IMMEDIATE IN PANIC SITUATIONS 
TRANSITIONING INTO ANS OUT OF THE CAR WHEN ON THE PHONE

TRIED TO VERBALLY SEND A TEXT BUT IT KEEPS GIVING ME CHOICES THAT I DID NOT SAY 
TRIM AROUND VENTS REFLECTS ONTO SIDE WINDOWS WHICH IS A LITTLE DISTRACTING WHEN VIEWING SIDE VIEW MIRRORS 
TRIM IN FRONT TOO CLOSE TO GROUND SCAPES ON DRIVEWAY AND DIPS LIKELY TO BE DAMAGED ON CURBS

TRUCK COMPARTMENT COVER IS IN THE HIGH POSITION REAR VIEWING IS SMALL
TRUCK DRIVES EXCEPTIONALLY WELL AND RIDES WELL FOR A PICKUP!
TRUCK FEELS SOLID 
TRUCK NEEDS A BETTER SOUND SYSTEM/SPEAKERS FOR A TRUCK THAT COSTS $70000
TRUCK SHOULD HAVE CD PLAYER I HAVE MANY CDS AND NOW CAN NOT PLAY THEM PLAYING MUSIC USING USB IS NOT EASY TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING PANDORA SYSTEM IS COMPLICATED 
TRUCK SITS PRETTY HIGH UP STOCK SO YOU HAVE TO GET USE TO LOOKING DOWN AT MOST OTHER CARS REGULAR HAS BLIND SPOTS AT B PILLAR
TRUCK SPACE
TRUCK SPACE SUCKS/TERRIBLE ON GAS
TRUCKS SHOULD NOT HAVE A LARGE CURVE PASSENGER MIRROR BUT A FLAT ONE WITH ONLY A SMALL CURVED ONE FOR EASE OF BACKING TRAILERS 
TRUE 4 WHEEL DRIVE
TRUELY A AWESOME SUV 
TRULY A BENEFIT TO HAVE ALL THAT TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE WHETHER OR NOT YOU USE ALL OF IT

TRUTHFULLY YOU MUST BE KIDDING FOR SENDING $1 00 FOR COMPLETING THIS SURVEY I WILL BE CONTACTING TOYOTA TO VOICE MY OPINION OF THE EXCESSIVE TIME INVOLVED YOU SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED TO TREAT PEOPLE THIS WAY 
TRY A LEXUS SYSTEM FOR POINTERS 
TRYING TO ASK FOR NAVIGATION VIA VOICE REC WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IF YOU COULD CORRECT WRONG STREET BY SPELLING I FINALLY STOPPED AND USED TOUCH SCREEN ALSO DESPITE MULTIPLE TRIES CAN T MAKE WIFI HOTSPOT WORK
TRYING TO CHECK TO THE REAR FROM INSIDE THE VEHICLE TO CHANGE LANES GIVES A LIMITED VIEW DUE TO THE HEADRESTS ON THE REAR SEATS I WILL BE REMOVING THEM WHEN TAKING TRIPS WITH JUST MYSELF AND SPOUSE! 
TRYING TO ENGAGE CD PLAYER WHILE DRIVING WAS TRICKY AND DISTRACTING
TRYING TO FIND THE LOCATION YOU WANT TO GO TO THREW THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM IS CONFUSING 
TRYING TO SEE OVER AND AROUND THE BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS 
TRYING TO TELL THE NAV SYSTEM A STREET ADDRESS IS VERY PROTRACTED 
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE ICONS
TRYING TO USE COMPUTERIZED PAD
TRYING TO USE THE MOUSE WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION IS AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO HAPPEN COMPUTER MICE AND ANALOG CLOCKS ARE SO 1980 S IF TOUCH SCREENS HAVE MADE APPLE THE WORLD S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY 
TUNER KNOBS NOT IN GOOD LOCATION CONTROLS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL SHOULD INCLUDE TUNING
TUNING BUTTONS YOU ALMOST ALWAYS CHANGE THE TEMP CONTROL ON PASSENGER SIDE AT SAME TIME YOU CHANGE THE CHANNEL
TUNING CHANNELS MANUALLY BASIC WAY TO TUNE CHANNEL WORKED NOW IT IS TOO CONFUSING
TUNING OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF PHONE NAV TUNING OF SATELLITE STATIONS THROUGH DIAL KNOB IS LESS THAN CONVENIENT OR EASY IT DISTRACTS DRIVER FROM USING IT WHILE DRIVING 
TUNING RADIO TO PRE PROGRAMMED STATIONS TAKES SEVERAL TOUCHES TO GET THERE 
TUNING SATELLITE AND BROADCAST RADIO IS HARD
TUNNEL VISION HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW REAR CAMERA EQUIPPED YES HOWEVER BLIND SPOTS ARE STILL THERE ITS NOT PANORAMIC VIEW
TUNNIN OUT THE CITY
TURBO
TURBO LAG

TURN DIAL TO SELECT SATELLITE STATIONS EASY TO USE
TURN OFF DIGITAL DISPLAY ONE TOUCH STAY OFF WHEN ADJUSTING REDUNDANT BUTTONS SWITCHES ETC 
TURN ON QUICKER WHEN CAR STARTS

TURNING AT A ANGLE DOES DIMINISH YOUR VISUAL FIELD A LITTLE 
TURNING AUDIO ON/OFF
TURNING HEADLIGHTS
TURNING LIGHTS HELPS IN DARK AREAS
TURNING RADIUS
TURNING RADIUS & EASE ON ENTRY
TURNING RADIUS IS TOO SMALL
TURNING RADIUS TOO LARGE
TURNING RADIUS TOO WIDE
TURNING RATIO
TURNING THE MAIN SUN VISOR TO THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW HITS ME IN THE FACE THE SECONDARY VISOR IS DIFFICULT TO DEPLOY I PREFER THE SECONDARY TO BE HINGED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PRIMARY VSOR 
TURNING THE RADIO ON FROM THE START UP MENU IS A MYSTERY THAT REQUIRES READING THE MANUAL NOT MUCH OF A COMPLAINT BUT YOU ASKED 
TURNING TO LOOK BACK ON DRIVER S SIDE BLOCKED SOMEWHAT BY THE DON T KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT DOOR SIDE?
TURNING TOWARD RIGHT BLIND SPOT
TURNS ON MY IPOD WHEN THE ENGINE STARTS
TURNS SHARP EASE OF PARKING
TUTBO
TV WOULD BE NICE
TWEEKING THE VOICE COMMAND FOR THE SYSTEM AT TIMES I JUST GIVE UP DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNITION 
TWICE I HAVE ALMOST PULLED OVER ONTO A VEHICLE IN THE RIGHT LANE BECAUSE I COULD NOT SEE THEM IN THE RIGHT HAND MIRROR THIS IS EVEN WITH THE CHANGE LANE SAFETY FEATURE 
TWITTER APP DOES NOT CONNECT
TWO BOOKS TO EXPLAIN ALL THE FEATURES MAKE IT A ONE THIN BOOK WITH EASY TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS PLEASE YOU CAN ALWAYS KEEP THE TWO BIG BOOKS BUT ONE SHORT AND TO THE POINT ON HOW TO USE THE DIFFERENT FEATURES WOULD ALLOW ME TO USE A LOT MORE FEA 
TWO DISTRACTIVE
TWO ISSUES FIRST CELLPHONE AUDIO IS GARBLED ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CONVERSATION 100% OF THE TIME I NEED TO HAVE THIS LOOKED AT WHEN I BRING THE VEHICLE IN FOR SERVICING SECOND I HAVE THE CABRIOLET WHICH PRECLUDES THE CAR FROM HAVING VOICE ACTI 
TWO MAJOR BLINDSPOTS EXIST THE FIRST IS WHERE THE WINDOW SLOPES BETWEEN THE PASSENGER WINDOW AND THE FRONT WINDOW THIS OFTEN CREATES A BLOCK OF THE VIEW OF TRAFFIC WHEN APPROACHING FROM THE RIGHT THE SAME HOLDS TRUE SOMETIMES WHEN FOR INSTA 
TWO MANY SUBSCRIPTIONS DIFFERENT FREE TRIAL PERIODS 911 CALL TO EASY TO BUMP BY MISTAKE WHEN ADJUSTING REAR VIEW MIRROR 
TWO MINOR COMPLAINTS ON VISIBILITY THE HIGH PROFILE ON THE HOOD AND THE DOOR MOUNTED MIRRORS THE MIRRORS ESPECIALLY PASSENGER SIDE REQUIRE YOU TO TURN YOUR HEAD SIGNIFICANTLY TO VIEW THEM THEY ARE PLACED TO FAR BACK ON THE DOOR THE OTHER GR 
TWO MORE SPEAKERS IN THE BACK BUT THEN AGAIN I CHOSE NOT TO BUY THE TOURING EDITION WITH BETTER FEATURES 
TWO SCREENS SEEMS UNNECESSARY THE CLOCK CAN T BE RELOCATED WHEN USING PICTURE ON THE WALL PAPER 
TWO SEPARATE SCREENS ARE VERY USEFUL 
TWO THINGS AUDIO CONSOLE WOULD BE NICE IF IT WERE TILTED TOWARDS THE DRIVER FOR EASIER USE AND VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY WHEN TOP IS DOWN THE SOUND FROM SPEAKERS ISN T THE BEST BUT I SUPPOSE NO ONE BUYS A JEEP FOR ACOUSTICS 
TWO THINGS MAKE IT MORE INTUITIVE AND BONUS THE VOLUME KNOB IS LAUGHABLY SMALL SAVING MONEY ON RUBBER ARE WE? OR DID SOME RECENT DESIGN GRAD S PROFESSOR USED TO THINK TINY KNOBS WERE COOL?
TWO THINGS THAT STAND OUT IN MY MIND ONE IS THAT THE NAVIGATION AND ENTERTAINMENT CONTROLS ON THE SCREEN ARE STILL A LITTLE SLOW AND CRYPTIC AND WHEN USING HANDS FREE CALL THE AUDIO OF THE CALL ALMOST SOUNDS HOLLOW OR LIKE I AM SPEAKING TO SOM 
TWO THINGS THE FIRST IS THE QUALITY OF RECEPTION OF THE RADIO AND SPEAKERS IS NOT REALLY VERY GOOD I WOULD LIKE THE ABILITY TO ALLOW THE PASSENGER TO PROGRAM THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING THERE SHOULD BE A BUTTON OR RELEASE 
TWO THINGS THERE ARE STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS TO CYCLE THROUGH AUDIO FAVORITES BUT THEY ONLY CYCLE WITHIN A BAND SO YOU CAN T SWITCH BETWEEN AN FM FAVORITE AND A SATELLITE FAVORITE WITHOUT RESORTING TO THE TOUCHSCREEN TRAFFIC ALERTS E G WR 
TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO PLACE A USB PORT OUTSIDE OF THE MIDDLE CONSOLE SPEAKERS CRACKLE 
TWO WORDS DISTRACTED DRIVING BUT I DO LIKE THE QUALITY SPEAKERS BUT BACK OFF ON THE BELLS AND WHISTLES
TYPICAL COUPE SIGHTLINE PROBLEMS 
TYPICAL LANE CHANGING DIFFICULTIES FOR A SPORTS CAR
TYPICAL OF MOST COUPES THE VISIBILITY AT THE REAR QUARTERS IS NOT GOOD THE SENSORS HELP WHEN CHANGING LANES 
TYPICAL PORSCHE BUILT/ENGINEERED WELL 
TYPICAL SUV BLIND SPOTS WIDE A PILLARS
TYPICALLY IT IS MY WIFE WHO IS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT WHO USES THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE BUT PEOPLE WE CALL HAVE DIFFICULTY HEARING HER WHEREAS WE DO NOT ENCOUNTER SUCH PROBLEMS WHEN WE ARE DRIVING OUR 2010 HYUNDAI GENESIS IT MAY WELL BE THE LO 
TYPING IN ADDRESSES DO NOT LIKE THAT THE KEYBOARD DISAPPEARS WHEN THE SYSTEM THINKS IT KNOWS WHAT IS COMING NEXT TOO MANY UNUSUAL NAMES IN SOUTH TEXAS FOR THAT TO BE EFFECTED VERY FRUSTRATING!
TYPING IN DESTINATIONS IN THE NAVI SYSTEM IS ONEROUS THE TOP DOWN STATE CITY FIRST APPROACH IS DUMB

UPDATE THE MAP INFORMATION OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND CORRECT THE ERRORS 
UPDATE THE PORT TO SOMETHING CURRENT AND VERSATILE

UPDATED SCREEN OTHER JEEP VEHICLES HAVE LARGER SHARPER SCREENS 
UPDATES FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING AND FREE FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE USER UPDATED NOT DEALERSHIP 
UPDATES TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND COLOR SCHEMES ARE VERY GOOD
UPGRADE CAPABILITY OF NAV SYSTEM
UPGRADE OUTDATED GRAPHICS ON NAV SYSTEM AND IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
UPGRADE SPEAKERS TO IMPROVE SOUND QUALITY
UPGRADE STEREO SYSTEM
UPGRADE THE 2015 ACADIA TO HAVE THE SAME SYSTEM AS THE 2015 GMC SIERRA THE LOOK IS VERY DIFFERENT THE ACADIA NEEDS AN UPGRADE

UPON STARTUP THE AUDIO SYSTEM SCREEN DISPLAYS A WARNING MESSAGE ABOUT SAFE DRIVING FOR TOO LONG PREVENTING ME FROM HAVING IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS THE MESSAGE WAS UNDERSTOOD AFTER FIRST READING AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO READ IT 
USABILITY
USABILITY ISSUES APPS DON T WORK I CANNOT GET EMAIL MESSAGES WITH IPHONE 5S AUDIO DOESN T ALWAYS PLAY WELL THROUGH BLUE TOOTH TOUCHSCREEN WOULD BE VERY DESIRABLE VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY 
USB
USB AND EXTERNAL AUDIO PLUG IN CLOSING COMPARTMENT ABOVE GLOVE BOX COULD HAVE A HOLE/PORT SO A DEVICE CAN BE PLUGGED IN AND STILL EASILY SHUT THE COMPARTMENT 
USB AND LIGHTNING PORT FOR IPHONE 6
USB AND MEMORY CARDS ARE IN GLOVE BOX AND A IT HARD TO GET TO AS THE DRIVER 
USB AUDIO FILES NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE SORTED ALPHABETICALLY
USB CAPABILITIES
USB CONNECTION CUE IS SLUGGISH TO CHANGE SONGS HAVE TO PLAY ON MY PHONE FOR MUSIC TO START EACH TIME I START MY CAR VOICE RECOGNITION LOTS OF COMMANDS SLOW
USB CONNECTION DOES A GREAT JOB CHARGING MY PHONE WHILE IN USE MY LAST CAR WAS BARELY ABLE TO KEEP IT FROM DISCHARGING WHILE BEING USED FOR NAVIGATION THIS VEHICLE CHARGES MY PHONE QUICKLY WHILE STILL ALLOWING ME TO USE IT FOR NAV 
USB CONNECTION DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK 
USB CONNECTION S ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN SD CARDS I WOULD USE USB TO PLUG MY IPHONE INTO THE AUDIO SYSTEM AS I DO IN MY OTHER CAR A 2014 JEEP 
USB CONNECTION SHOULD BE STANDARD INSTEAD OF BEING A $1700 OPTION 
USB CONNECTION TO IPHONE INCONSISTENT 
USB CONNECTIVITY
USB CONNECTIVITY USING AN IPOD DEVICE IS TERRIBLE IT S SO BAD I WOULD NEVER CONSIDER A GM PRODUCT AGAIN AMERICA IS CAR CULTURE AND CARS AND TUNES GO TOGETHER EVEN MORE SO WITH A CORVETTE MY IPOD USB CONNECTIVITY ISSUES HAVE REALLY SPOILED 
USB CONNECTIVITY WAS PART OF A $3 000 OPTION COULD NOT AFFORD IT THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD 
USB CONNECTIVITY WITHOUT BLUETOOTH
USB CONNECTOR MAKES NO SENSE REGULAR USB PORT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER WITH IT I CAN CHARGE THE PHONE AND ALSO LISTEN TO MUSIC THE CABLE I GOT FROM DEALER ONLY SUPPORTS OLD IPOD I HAVE ANDROID PHONE

USB IPOD ACCESS!

USE OF THE KNOBS IS CUMBERSOME AND NOT EASY TO USE ESPECIALLY WHILE DRIVING
USE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CUMBERSOME AT BEST 
USE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS LIMITED WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A SAFETY RESTRICTION TO KEEP DRIVERS FROM TAKING THEIR EYES OFF THE ROAD BUT IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF THE PASSENGER COULD USE THE SYSTEM REGARDLESS OF 
USE OF THE NAVIGATION WHILE MOVING THERE IS A SENSOR FOR THE PASSENGER AIR BAG WHY NOT TAP INTO THAT SENSOR AND ALLOW NAVIGATION IF THERE IS A PASSENGER

USER INTERFACE COULD BE BETTER ALSO IT S A BIG CABIN AND A FAR REACH TO TOUCH THE SCREEN WHILE DRIVING 
USER INTERFACE FEELS A LITTLE BIT DATED AND NAVIGATION IS SOMETIMES A BIT CONFUSING 
USER INTERFACE IS GREAT 
USER INTERFACE IS HIDEOUS LOOK TO BOTH IOS OR ANDROID FOR INSPIRATION THE CURRENT UI LOOKS LIKE IT WAS BORROWED FROM A 2008 MICROWAVE 
USER INTERFACE IS NOT INTUITIVE AND AT TIMES THE DEVICE DOES NOT SENSE MY TOUCH UNTIL THE 3RD OR 4TH TIME THIS COULD BE USER ERROR SCREEN ALSO REFLECTS SUNLIGHT INTO DRIVER S EYES 
USER INTERFACE IS POOR BMW SHOULD ADOPT APPLE S CAR PLAY AND JUST SCRAP THEIR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SYSTEM 
USER INTERFACE IS POOR DISPLAYS COORDINATION WITH TOUCH BUTTONS BELOW SCREEN AUDIO QUALITY OK
USER INTERFACE ISN T EXACTLY INTUITIVE
USER INTERFACE ISSUES 1 OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE FONT TOO SMALL HARD TO READ! 2 DAY/TIME CLOCK FONT TOO SMALL HARD TO READ! 3 DAY/TIME CLOCK SHOULD BE PROMINENT IN ALL SCREENS AT ALL TIMES ! 3 INFORMATION DISPLAY / ECO MONITOR NEED RECENT AVERAG 
USER INTERFACE NEEDS A TOUCHSCREEN OR A BETTER WAY TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE SYSTEMS INPUT CONTROLS FOR MAIN SCREEN ARE VERY POOR AND TAKE WAY TOO MUCH TIME TO FIND AND ACCESS THE RELEVANT MENU S MENUS HAVE TOO MANY LEVELS AND TAKE TOO MUCH CONCENT

USER INTERFACE OF TOUCHSCREEN AND EASE OF IPHONE CONNECTIVITY
USER INTERFACE ON HEAD UNIT IS DATED AND NOT WELL DESIGNED BUTTONS TOO SMALL HAVE TO LOOK OFF ROAD FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME THAN SHOULD BE NECESSARY TO USE IT 
USER INTERFACE SEEMS DATED WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES IN THIS CLASS

USER SETTINGS ARE SOMETIMES CONVOLUTED AND NOT EASY TO NAVIGATE I VE EXPERIENCED POOR DIRECTIONS WHEN USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO KIND OF KNOW WHERE YOU RE GOING BEFORE HAND FASTEST AND SHORTEST DON T ALWAYS WORK AS EXPECTED 
USES A TOUCHPAD SYSTEM THAT REQUIRES MORE STEPS FOR BASIC FUNCTIONS WHEN MAKING A CALL ONE NEEDS TO TAKE TWO STEPS AND THEN USE TOUCHPAD TO SELECT WHICH NUMBER PRESS TOUCHPAD ONCE TO SELECT THEN ONCE AGAIN TO CALL VERY CUMBERSOME AND DISTRACT 
USING A TOUCH SCREEN TO CHANGE FROM AM TO FM AND VICE VERSA AS WELL AS CHANGE STATIONS TAKES TOO MUCH ATTENTION AWAY FROM DRIVING THE OLD PUSH BUTTONS TAKE LESS ATTENTION 
USING AFTERMARKET HEADLIGHTS
USING BLUE TOOTH
USING BLUETOOTH FOR ENGAGING THE PHONE 
USING BLUETOOTH FOR HANDS FREE CALLING AND PLAYING MUSIC ON MY I PHONE 
USING BLUETOOTH TO MAKE PHONE CALLS IS CLUNKY WOULD NICE TO BE ABLE TO USE ONE STEP COMMANDS TO CALL SOMEONE EG CALL XX MOBILE AND YOU JUST GET CONNECTED OCCASIONALLY THE RADIO JUMPS BETWEEN HD1 AND HD2 I HAVE NO IDEA HOW OR WHY THIS HAPP

USING NAVIGATION
USING ON STAR AND SPEAKING TO A REAL PERSON MADE A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE

USING SIRI THROUGH THE SYSTEM
USING STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO CONTROL MUSIC
USING THE
USING THE ALPHABET KEYPAD IS VERY SLOW AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT TAKES QUITE A BIT OF PRESSURE TO SELECT A LETTER/NUMBER

USING VOICE COMMANDS INSTEAD OF TYPING IN INFO
USING VOICE COMMANDS TO ENTER DESTINATION ADDRESSES MUST BE IMPROVED IT IS FAR TOO DIFFICULT TO DO CURRENTLY AND RARELY WORKS PROPERLY THE PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME AND SHOULD BE SIMPLIFIED 
USING VOICE COMMANDS TO LOCATE POINT OF INTEREST AND HAVING THE DIRECTIONS SENT TO NAVIGATION WITHIN SECONDS IS AWESOME 
USING VOICE CONTROL TO ENTER DESTINATION INTERSECTION OR POINT OF INTEREST 
USING VOICE RECOGNITION IS ACTUALLY PAINLESS AND RECOGNIZES YOUR COMMANDS IMMEDIATELY NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD USE THAT FEATURE THAT OFTEN BUT NOW USE IT DAILY

VISIBILITY ALL AROUND IS NOT GREAT WINDOWS SEEM TOO SMALL 
VISIBILITY AND DRIVE POSITION ARE EXCELLENT

VISIBILITY DEFICENCIES ARE MADE UP FOR BY THE OUTSTANDING CAMERA AND WARNING SYSTEMS
VISIBILITY DIFFICULT WHEN CHANGING LANES ELECTRONIC COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ME 
VISIBILITY FOR BLIND SPOTS IS POOR BUT THE BLIND SPOT SENSORS MAKE UP FOR IT THEY ARE REALLY HELPFUL
VISIBILITY FOR REAR PASSENGER SIDE WIDOWS COULD BE IMPROVED
VISIBILITY FORWARD AND TO THE LEFT IS MUCH IMPROVED OVER THE 2006 V50 WHERE THE SUPPORT POST FOR THE ROOF CONSTANTLY BLOCKED MY VIEW OF PEDESTRIANS APPROACHING FROM THE LEFT 
VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER S SEAT TO THE AREA AROUND RIGHT REAR QUARTER AREA OF THE CAR IS VERY VERY POOR WHEN BACKING UP PARTICULARLY WHEN A LARGER VEHICLE SUV PICKUP TRUCK VAN IS PARKED ALONG SIDE OF YOU YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY MOVING PERHAPS FU 
VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT
VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT FOR OVERTAKING TRAFFIC IS POOR BUT THE INSTALLED SAFETY PACKAGE WITH OVERTAKING AND PROXIMITY WARNINGS TENDS TO OFFSET THIS WHICH MAKES IT AN ESSENTIAL OPTION
VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT LOOKING LEFT THE WINDSHIELD POST SEEMS IN THE WRONG POSITION AND BLOCKS VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING
VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT LOOKING TO YOUR RIGHT REAR IS POOR ALWAYS WONDERING IS THERE SOMEONE ON MY RIGHT SIDE AS I CHANGE LANES 
VISIBILITY FROM PASSENGER SEAT COULD BE IMPROVED BY HAVING AN UP AND DOWN ADJUSTMENT ON THE POWER SEAT DASH IS A LITTLE HIGH FROM PASSENGER SEAT AND PASSENGER IS TALL 
VISIBILITY FROM REAR WINDOW COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER I M SHORT SO THAT COULD BE PART OF THE REASON THAT VISIBILITY IS LESS 
VISIBILITY FROM SIDE MIRRORS IS GREAT VIEW FROM BACK WINDOW IS LIMITED IN THE HATCHBACK 
VISIBILITY FROM THE 2 REAR CORNERS IS LIMITED DUE THE SOFT TOP DESIGN BUT THE DESIGN IS SO GOOD AND SIDE MIRRORS AND REAR CAMERA ARE SO EFFECTIVE THAT IT S FINE SUN VISORS SHOULD BE TELESCOPING I VE THOUGHT THAT SINCE MY FIRST 1978 911 SC 
VISIBILITY FROM THE BACK SEAT IS VERY RESTRICTED BY THE FRONT SEAT HEADREST EVEN IN A FULL DOWN POSITION

VISIBILITY FROM THE REAR MIRRORS COULD BE BETTER IF THERE WAS A DOUBLE MIRROR TO SEE ALL BLIND SPOTS
VISIBILITY FROM THE REAR SIDES IS REALLY BAD NON EXISTENT 
VISIBILITY FROM THE THIRD ROW SEAT IS MORE OBSTRUCTED IN THIS NEW 2015 MODEL COMPARED TO EARLIER MODELS LIKE THE 2005 MODEL WE TRADED IN AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE THRID ROW SEAT DESIGN JUST SEEMS TO OBSTRUCT VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER SEEING OUT 
VISIBILITY FROM THIS LARGE TALL VEHICLE IS EXCELLENT!
VISIBILITY FROM VEHICLE IS OF NO CONCERN! I FEEL EXCEPTIONALLY SAFE IN MY CITADEL!!

VISIBILITY IMPROVED WHEN I RAISED THE DRIVERS SEAT 
VISIBILITY IN SIDE MIRRORS IS OUTSTANDING
VISIBILITY IN THE AREA OF THE TINY FRONT LEFT WINDOW IS NOT GOOD THE STRUCTURE OF THE CAR SURROUNDING THAT TINY WINDOW INTERRUPTS THE VIEW CONSIDERABLY THIS MAKES IT AWKWARD TO LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION WHILE MAKING A LEFT TURN 
VISIBILITY IN THE BACK QUADRANT IS VERY POOR AND LOT OF CAUTION IS REQUIRED TO AVOID BACKING INTO OBJECTS THE LARGER SIDE MIRRORS ARE HELPFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES OR PASSING 
VISIBILITY IN THE NEW CY CORVETTE IS FAR BETTER THAN THE CURRENT CAMARO I HAVE NO PROBLEMS KNOWING OF AND BEING ABLE TO SEE ANY/ALL CARS AROUND ME 
VISIBILITY IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR ON DOORS
VISIBILITY IN THIS VEHICLE IS FANTASTIC THE SMALL WINDOWS NEXT TO THE MIRRORS REALLY OPEN UP THE CAR THE STRUT BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOOR IS THE ONLY ASPECT THAT DETRACTS FROM THE VISIBILITY BUT THAT IS MOSTLY DUE TO MY HEIGHT AND SEAT POSI 
VISIBILITY IS A LITTLE CHALLENGING 
VISIBILITY IS ABOVE AVERAGE BLIND SPOT AWARENESS COULD BE IMPROVED
VISIBILITY IS ABOVE AVERAGE I HAVE ALMOST NO BLIND SPOTS AND FEEL VERY SAFE WHILE DRIVING MY 4RUNNER 
VISIBILITY IS AMAZING
VISIBILITY IS AN ISSUE IN THIS CAR I CANNOT SEE VEHICLES THAT ARE IN MY SIDE VIEW EASILY AND THE REARVIEW IS VERY SMALL AS WELL WHEN THE SPOILER RAISES IT REDUCES THE REAR VIEW MORE 
VISIBILITY IS AN ISSUE THAT WILL IMPACT MY DECISION TO KEEP THIS CAR
VISIBILITY IS AVERAGE 
VISIBILITY IS BAD WHEN CHANGING LANE DUE TO VICHILE S HEIGHT GOOD THING IT HAS BLIND SPOT SYSTEM
VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN COMPETITORS 
VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN THE G37 I PREVIOUSLY DROVE
VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT WHEN BACKING UP ALTHOUGH IT HAS A BACKUP CAMERA
VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT WHEN LOOKING BACK TO THE RIGHT REAR BLIND SPOTS 
VISIBILITY IS DISTORTED BECAUSE OF THE UPPER WINDOW BEING TINTED AND LOWER WINDOW NOT IN HATCHBACK PLUS THE CAMERA IS STILL A PROBLEM WITH THE ROUNDNESS OF THE VIEW AND THE DRIVING RAIN 
VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT

VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO DRIVE MY MINI 
VISIBILITY IS EXCEPTIONAL FOR THE SIZE OF THE X 5
VISIBILITY IS FINE OTHER THAN LOOKING OVER LEFT SHOULDER WHEN SHIFTING LANES OR MERGING

VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM SLOW TO BOOT UP
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM STILL A LITTLE TOUGH TO USE MORE TECHNOLOGY BETTER INTERNET ACCESS ALLOW SCREEN IN FRONT TO PLAY MOVIES OR STREAM TV MIRROR IPHONE SCREEN FOR PC LIKE ACCESS
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM TAKES TOO LONG TO INTERPRET/PROCESS VERBAL COMMANDS AND UTILIZES TOO MANY DIFFERENT PROMPTS TO INITIATE ONE SINGLE TASK AFTER A COMMAND IS GIVEN IT TAKES 3 4 SECONDS FOR THE SYSTEM TO PROCESS THE COMMAND AND INITIATE T

VOICE SYSTEM WHEN TRYING TO GET ON STAR TO UNDERSTAND A PHONE NUMBER YOU ARE TRYING TO CALL
VOICE TEXTING COMMANDS WOULD BE A REAL PLUS
VOICE TEXTING DOES NOT WORK WITH IPHONE AND REMOTE START THROUGH PHONE APP FAILS FREQUENTLY

VOICES QUALITY OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS GREATLY IMPROVED
VOICES WHEN USING BLUETOOTH ARE GARBLED
VOICETAG
VOIE RECOGNITION FOR TEXTING 
VOLKSWAGEN DESPERATELY NEEDS TO ADD CARPLAY SUPPORT I ALMOST BOUGHT ANOTHER BRAND BECAUSE OF THIS 
VOLKSWAGEN SHOULD COME UP WITH AN AFTERMARKET SOLUTION TO UPDATE THE SYSTEM WITH APPLE S CARPLAY IMMEDIATELY
VOLUME
VOLUME ADJUSTMENT OF NAVIGATION AND PHONE NEEDS TO BE INDEPENDENT OF RADIO 
VOLUME AND CLARITY
VOLUME AND STATION CONTROL ARE ON STEERING WHEEL AND BLUE TOOTH ARE VOICE ACTIVATED NO NEED TO TAKE EYES OFF THE ROAD VERY IMPORTANT WHEN DRIVING IN HEAVY TARIFF OR BAD WEATHER
VOLUME AND TREBLE CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE WHEN USING SD CARD OR USB EVEN WITH THE LESS OR MORE CONTROLS NOT SURE WHY THIS IS? THE NAVIGATION POI DOES NOT HAVE A REST AREA LOCATOR OPTION
VOLUME AND TUNING KNOBS A BIT TOO SMALL 
VOLUME BUTTON ON SCREEN OFTEN CAUSES OTHER FUNCTIONS YOU DON T WISH TO ACTIVATE WHEN REACHING FOR THE VOLUME BUTTON MUST TAKE EYES OFF ROAD
VOLUME BUTTON ON THE RADIO SHOULD BE MORE SENSITIVE 
VOLUME BUTTONS ARE RIDICULOUSLY SMALL AND EXCEPT ON THE STEERING WHEEL THEY ARE POORLY LOCATED
VOLUME CHANNEL IPOD CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL WOULD BE GREAT 
VOLUME CLARITY AND SOUND OF AUDIO SPEAKERS 
VOLUME CONTROL / KNOB NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE PROMINENT I KEEP ADJUSTING THE TEMPERATURE CONTROL BY MISTAKE BECAUSE IT S THE BIGGEST / CLOSET KNOB TO ME AND IT S RARE THAT I NEED TO ADJUST THAT VERY OFTEN CERTAINLY NOT QUICKLY LIKE I OFTEN WANT T 
VOLUME CONTROL COULD BE BETTER AS WELL AS THE CONNECTIONS FOR OTHER THAN APPLE DEVICES WOULD BE HELPFUL
VOLUME CONTROL COULD GO HIGHER
VOLUME CONTROL DIFFICULT TO POSITION TO THE DESIRED LEVEL HIGHLY VARIABLE ESPECIALLY WHILE DRIVING
VOLUME CONTROL DOES NOT ALLOW FOR BEST SOUND LEVEL 
VOLUME CONTROL DOES NOT SHOW LEVEL ON TOUCH SCREEN NOR SYSTEM SCREEN NOT ABLE TO SWITCH MODES FROM STEERING WHEEL AUDIO DURING CALLS COULD BE BETTER IN QUALITY AND CLEARNESS 
VOLUME CONTROL DWOULD BE BETER WITH A TURNING KNOB
VOLUME CONTROL FOR NAVIGATION
VOLUME CONTROL FOR SOUND SYSTEM SHOULD BE ON STEERING WHEEL
VOLUME CONTROL IN STEERING WHEEL IS VERY HANDY 
VOLUME CONTROL ON STEERING WHEEL
VOLUME CONTROL ON STEERING WHEELS WHICH IS STANDARD ON A LOT OF OTHER VEHICLES VOICE RECOGNITION IS SHODDY
VOLUME CONTROL ON THE ARM REST CONSOLE 
VOLUME CONTROL SHOULD BE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE A NICE OPTION THE DELAY WHEN SWITCHING FROM ONE SOURCE TO THE IPOD IS EXCESSIVE 
VOLUME CONTROL SWIPING AT THE VOLUME CONTROL WHILE DRIVING IS TOUGH 
VOLUME CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL ARE AWKWARDLY PLACED TOYOTA S IMPLEMENTATION IS MUCH BETTER 
VOLUME CONTROLS ON STERRING WHEEL

VOLUME OF THE NAVIGATION NARRATIOR
VOLUME ON BLUE TOOTH WAY TOO LOW 
VOLUME UP/DOWN LOCATED ON STEERING WHEEL IS TOO SMALL
VOLUME VARIES MARKEDLY BETWEEN DIFFERENT MEDIA SOURCES E G IPOD VERSUS IPHONE MENU ON TOUCH SCREEN SEEMS TO HAVE INCONSISTENT TOUCH SENSITIVITY NO WAY FOR COMMUNICATION CENTER TO BE PROGRAM NOT COME ONE WHEN STARTING THE CAR 
VOLUME VARIES ON ITS OWN 
VOLUME VARIES WHILE LISTENING GETS LOUDER OR SOFTER ON OWN CAN BE ANNOYING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT GETS REALLY LOUD 
VOLUME WILL NOT INCREASE OVER A SETTING OF 38 I LIKE IT LOADER AT TIMES WHEN THE WINDOW ARE OPEN OR I M TRAVELING DOWN THE HIGHWAY 
VOLUME/TUNE KNOBS ARE SHALLOW DON T PROTRUDE ENOUGH FROM FACEPLATE
VOLVO EMPHASIZES THE SAFETY OF THE CAR BUT DON T PROVIDE A SPARE OR PLACE TO STORE SPARE IF OWNER PURCHASES I HAVE HAD 2 FLATS IN 4 MONTHS OF OWNING THE CAR & VOLVO SERVICE IS STATING THAT THE LOW PROFILE TIRES ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET FLATS FROM P 
VOLVO HAS ALWAYS HAD BLIND SPOT ISSUES AND THIS CAR IS NO EXCEPTION IT IS MITIGATED A GREAT DEAL WITH THE BLIS 
VOLVO HAS THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING TO MAKE THIS VEHICLE FEEL SAFE AND SECURE ON THE ROAD 
VOLVO IS THE BEST IN SAFETY 
VOLVO PRESENTS THE DRIVER WITH 3 OPTIONS FOR PATH TO DESTINATION CAN T FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DISPLAY THE ACTUAL ROUTE LISTED AS STEPS TAKEN ON VARIOUS ROADS ON THE ROUTE ONLY CAN SEE A SMALL OVERVIEW MAP OF THE ROUTES WITH NO DESCRIPTION OF TH 
VOLVO S HAVE BLIND SPOTS THEY ALL DO

VW GOLF IS VERY WELL DESIGNED ITS VERY COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO DRIVE I CAN SEE EVERY ANGLE OF THE ROAD AND SEE IN THE REAR WITH EASE VERY SMOOTH CAR
VW S VERSION OF THE USB PORT IS POSITIONED AWKWARDLY IN THE SPACE THAT USED TO BE THE ASTRAY AND IT SHOULD BE A REGULAR USB INSTEAD OF THE PROPRIETARY CONNECTION 
W/O THE BACK UP CAMERA IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW
W/S WIPER PARKING REST POSITION IS UGLY
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY TOO DIFFICULT TO OPERATE I GUESS THAT S WHY GM HAS A CUSTOMER SERVICE GROUP DEDICATED TO THE COMMUNICATION SOUND ETC AREA

WARNING INDICATOR FOR OTHER VEHICLES ANY TECH FORWARD SAFETY FEATURES THAT LOWER INSURANCE RATES WHILE PROVIDING HIGH END SAFETY FEATURES AT A REASONABLE INTRODUCTORY LEVEL
WARNING OF VEHICLES IN BLIND SPOT
WARNING ON REAR CAMERA INCREDIBLY ANNOYING
WARNING SIGNAL TOO QUIET WHEN RADIO ON
WARNING SIGNALS SHOULD GET LOUDER WHEN RADIO ON I LIKE WINDSHIELD WIPERS OF SAME SIZE 
WARNING SYSTEM HAS BEEN GREAT 
WARNING SYSTEM ON SIDE MIRRORS DEFINITELY HELP WITH THE BLIND SPOTS 
WARNING SYSTEM SEEMS TO REPORT ACCIDENTS THAT ARE NOT REALLY THERE ALSO NARROW LANE MESSAGES THAT DON T APPLY
WARNING SYSTEMS ARE GOOD BUT TOO MANY DIFFERENT WARNING SOUNDS DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE IS ALERTING NO BLIND SIDE ALERT IN SIDE MIRRORS FOR ALL THE SAFETY ITEMS ON THIS CAR HOW COULD THAT BE MISSING? I HAD IT ON MY LAST CAR BUI 
WARRANTY
WAS ABLE TO BE CONVERTED TO BE WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE

WASHER DOESN T APPEAR TO DISPENSE ENOUGH LIQUID TO REACH THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD IF THE CAR ISN T MOVING 
WASHER FLUID DISPENSER COULD USE DIFFERENT NOZZLES THAT PROVIDE MORE COVERAGE WHEN SPRAYING ADDITION OF REAR WIPER WOULD BE NICE BACKUP CAMERA COULD BE A BETTER QUALITY 
WASHER ON DRIVER S SIDE HITS THE WINDSHIELD TOO LOW 
WASHER SEEMS CLOGGED 
WASHER SQUIRTS COULD SPRAY WIDER
WASHER/WIPERS STICK SOMETIMES & SUN VISORS NOT REALLY EFFECTIVE BUT WE LIVE IN FL 
WASHERS ALWAYS FREEZE ONLY USE MANUFACTURER FLUID
WASHERS ARE NOT VERY GOOD NOT AT GOOD AS BMW OR AUDI ALL WHEEL DRIVE DOES NOT FEEL AS STUCK TO THE ROAD AS BMW OR AUDI
WASHERS DON T ALWAYS SQUIRT HIGH ENOUGH PASANGER WIPER CAN BE INEFFECTIVE AND CAN ICE UP IN SOME CONDITIONS CREATING A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE CAR EXTREAMLY WARM 
WASHERS DON T SQUIRT HIGH ENUF
WASHERS KEEP FREEZING
WASHERS NOT WORKING
WASHERS SHOOT OVER VEHICLE
WASN T SURE I D USE THE BACK UP CAMERA BUT I LIKE IT ESPECIALLY HELPFUL SINCE VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS LIMITED 
WASTE OF TIME MONEY PROVIDING I POD PLUG WILL NOT ADAPT TO NEW IPHONE SHOULD GIVE CUSTOMER OPTION WHICH TO DELIVER WITH CAR WHOLE MMI SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AT DELIVERY MORE TIME SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO EXPERIENCE
WATER GETS TRAPPED ON DRIVER S SIDE WIPER AND A PILLAR WHEN DRIVING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS 
WATER POURS DOWN BOTH ENDS OF FRONT WINDSHIELD IN RAIN
WAY BETTER THAN THE CTS I HAD 
WAY KNOBS CONTROL RADIO
WAY MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THAN THE 2004 HEAVY NEED TO RELY ON ELECTRONICS 
WAY TO DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE RADIO STATIONS I USE OLD KNOB! REAL WEATHER AND TRAFFIC IS NOT ACCURATE OR TIMELY
WAY TOO COMPLICATED I WONDER HOW MAY PEOPLE ARE JUST OVERWHELMED BY THIS CAR AND DON T USE MOST OF THE FEATURES BECAUSE THEY ARE WAY TOO COMPLICATED I AM VERY GOOD AT THINGS LIKE THIS BUT FEEL THAT YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ARE POOR/INADEQUATE YOUR 
WAY TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS FROM DRIVERS SEAT 
WAY TOO MANY BUTTONS ON THE RADIO CHANGING MENU DISPLAY IS A GREAT IDEA BUT I HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF OF THE ROAD TO READ WHAT OPTIONS I AM SELECTING OR WHICH BUTTONS TO PRESS 
WAY TOO MANY FEATURES THAT I CAN T BELIEVE GET USED BY THAT MANY OWNERS
WAY TOO MANY OPTIONS TO USE HAVE TO STUDY MANUAL TO FIGURE HOW TO USE WHAT I REALLY NEED NOT INTUITIVE EASY TO USE GOOGLE MAPS BEFORE I START ON A TRIP DO NOT WANT TO LEARN PHONE APPS AND CAR APPS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT PHONE TO CAR AND HA 
WAY TOO MANY PROMPTS AND COMMANDS TO ENTER A DESTINATION ADDRESS
WAY WAY TOO COMPLICATED VERY FRUSTRATING TO USE
WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE BEING ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC FROM OUR SMARTPHONES VIA BLUETOOTH THE BLUETOOTH AND WIFI FEATURES ARE BY FAR THE OPTIONS WE HAVE ENJOYED THE MOST 
WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE AUTO ON LIGHTS WHEN IT SENSES IT IS DARK!
WE ALL FIT IN IT
WE ALSO HAVE A GPS SYSTEM THAT PLUGS INTO LIGHTER AND PROVIDES MORE VARIETY OF USES FOR EXAMPLE ON THE PORTABLE GPS WE CAN LOOK FOR RESTAURANTS BY TYPE CAN T DO THAT ON VW SYSTEM 
WE ALSO HAVE A LEXUS AND THE HEADLIGHTS ON IT ARE FAR SUPERIOR IN BRIGHTNESS AND CORNERING 
WE ALSO HAVE A TOYOTA SIENNA WITH NAV WE FEEL THE TOYOTA SYSTEM IS EASIER TO USE 
WE ALSO OWN A 2012 RANGE ROVER THE LARGEST ONE AND I FEEL JUST AS SAFE IN THE EVOQUE 
WE ARE ASIAN AND MOST OF THE TIME IT MISUNDERSTANDS US 
WE ARE COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH ALL EQUIPMENT IN OUR TAURUS 
WE ARE DISAPPOINTED TO STILL NOT HAVE THE ANTENNA INSTALLED TO USE WIFI AFTER 3 MONTHS 
WE ARE HAPPY THAT THEY IMPROVED THE VISORS WITH THE LITTLE EXTENSION PIECE YOU CAN PULL OUT WHEN YOU USE IT TO THE SIDE 
WE ARE HAPPY!
WE ARE HAVING A LOT OF DIFFICULTY USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT S NOT USER FRIENDLY 
WE ARE IN OUR 70 S AND RETIRED AND WE USUALLY DON T TRAVEL TO ANYWHERE WHERE WE HAVEN T BEEN BEFORE THEREFORE WE DON T USE THE NAVIGATION TO IT FULLEST WE HAVE ON OCCASION USED THE NAVIGATION TO TELL US HOW TO GET HOME BUT IT TOOK US TO A DIFF 
WE ARE MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE WAY IT IS 
WE ARE NOT TECH SAVY THE SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLICATED TOO MANY BELLS AND WHISTLES
WE ARE SENIORS AND JUST LEASED OR IS JANUARY 2015 AND STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE ALL THE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS 
WE ARE SHORT AND UNLESS YOU ARE THE DRIVER YOU CAN NOT ALWAYS BLOCK THE SUN FROM YOUR EYES BY LIFTING UP THE SEAT POSITION IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OVER THE HOOD AND THE FRONT BUMPER OF THE PICK UP SO PARKING IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE TRUCK IS SO 
WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH OUR KIA!
WE ARE VERY PLEASED WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM 
WE BOTH FEEL MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IN OUR 2015 MKZ THAN PREVIOUS 2013 CADILLAC XTS
WE BOUGHT THE CAR FOR THE SAFETY FEATURES AND THE CRASH TEST RATING WE HAVE TWO VOLVOS AND WONT BY ANY OTHER CARS MAINLY DUE TO THE FOCUS ON SAFETY THE STYLING IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER INNOVATIONS IN RECENT YEARS ARE VERY WELCOME 
WE CAN T FIGURE OUT WHY THE AUTO WIPERS SOMETIMES WORK AND SOMETIMES DON T I WISH THE SUN VISORS INCLUDED A SIDE VISOR 
WE CAN T USE OUR PHONE ! WE WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALERSHIP
WE CANNOT GET GPS TO WORK CORRECTLY PROBABLY IN MANUAL IF WE WANT TO LOOK IT UP WE DON T 
WE CANNOT GET THE TRAFFIC AND TRAVEL CONDITIONS TO WORK I HAVE MENTIONED THIS BEFORE BUT THAT WAS A HUGE SELLING FEATURE TO US BECAUSE OF THE TRAVEL WE DO AND NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO HELP US GET THAT HOOKED UP
WE CHECKED THE SAFETY RATING AND THE REPAIR RECORD BEFORE BUYING THIS VEHICLE THE LARGE BACKUP CAMERA WAS IMPORTANT TO US 
WE CHECKED WITH OUR INSURANCE COMPANY BEFORE BUYING THIS VEHICLE AND DISCOVERED THAT OUR PREMIUM WOULD ACTUALLY BE LOWER THAN ON OUR OLDER SUV DUE TO THE HIGH SAFETY RATING 
WE CHOSE NOT TO HAVE THE UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM AT THIS TIME I WAS ONLY CONCERNED WITH HANDS FREE PHONE AND TO BE ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC FROM MY PHONE SO I M VERY HAPPY WITH THE SYSTEM THAT CAME WITH THE CAR I JUT WOULD PREFER TO HAVE BETTER SPEAKER 
WE CHOSE THE HARMAN CARDIN SOUND SYSTEM AND WE LOVE IT
WE CONSTANTLY LOOK UP SAFETY RATING SYSTEMS AND CONSUMER REPORTS WHEN PURCHASING VEHICLES AND TOYOTA IS ALWAYS RANKED BETWEEN 1 AND 2 IN SAFETY THAT IS OUR BIGGEST THING WHEN WE BUY VEHICLES ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE A FAMILY NOW 
WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE AN I POD ERROR CONDITION THE SOURCE OF WHICH IS UNKNOWN AT THE TIME 
WE D LOVE IF THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION LIGHT WAS A BIT MORE VISIBLE 
WE DID NOT ORDER ALOT OF EXTRAS BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS PRIMARILY USED FOR WORK
WE DO NOT HAVE A HIGH END PACKAGE BUT THE SPEAKERS COULD USE A LITTLE UPGRADE USUALLY HAVE TO RUN VOLUME AROUND 50% TO HEAR WELL 
WE DO NOT HAVE ALL WHEEL DRIVE AND SOMETIMES THE TRACTION OF THE VEHICLE IS NOT VERY GOOD REAR VISIBILITY IS BAD WITHOUT THE CAMERA BUT FRONT VISIBILITY IS GREAT!
WE DO NOT HAVE THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS I WISH WE DID ALSO THE VEHICLE HAS A VERY LARGE BLIND SPOT IT WOULD BE NICE IF INFINITI OFFERED ELEMENTS OF THE SAFETY PACKAGE RATHER THAN ALL OR NOTHING
WE DO NOT HAVE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR FEATURE BLIND SPOTS ARE ALWAYS TRICKY AND ALWAYS WILL BE 
WE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE IT AND NEITHER DID THE AGENT WE HAVE NOT READ THE GUIDE BECAUSE HAVEN T TAKEN THE TIME TO TRY 
WE DO NOT LET THESE TYPES OF DEVICE INTERFERE WITH OUR DRIVING WE PLAY CD S OR LISTEN TO FM OR SAT> RADIO BOTH DRIVERS DO NOT WANT TO BE DISTRACTED FROM IMPORTANT DRIVING TASK FEATURES ARE NICE BUT DO NOT WANT TO BE DISTRACTED WHILE DRIVING 
WE DO NOT NEED SO MANY CHOICES WE ARE SENIOR DRIVERS AND NEED TO PULL OVER TO MAKE CHANGES IN THE RADIO LIFE WAS NOT ALWAYS THAT HARD !
WE DO NOT USE IT MUCH SO IT IS HARD TO PICK A MOST LIKED ITEM 
WE DO NOT USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BECAUSE WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING AS SENIOR CITIZENS WE HAVE LITTLE NEED FOR THE ELECTRONIC GIMMICKS BUT IT LOOKS NICE THE BOOK LEAVE MUCH TO BE DESIRED COULDN T FIND AUTO WIPER INFO TO SHUT OFF FOR GOING 
WE DO NOT USE THE ON BOARD NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE IT IS NAVIGATION READY IT IS INSANELY EXPENSIVE TO SUBSCRIBE WE USE OUR PHONES OR A HANDHELD NAVIGATION DEVICE AUDIO AND COMMUNICATIONS ARE VERY EASY TO USE AND CLEAR NICE ADDITIONS THE A 
WE DO NOT USE THE RADIO OR COMMUNICATION I DO NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM WISH I HAD THIS 
WE DO NOTUSE THE VOICE ACTIVATION FEATURE WE WILL AT A LATER TIME
WE DON T KNOW YET ALL THAT WE HAVE USED SO FAR IS THE RADIO 
WE DON T LIKE TO AUDIO SYSTEM IN THE 2015 CAR WE NOW HAVE OR THE 2012 CAR WE JUST TRADED THEY WERE HARD TO OPERATE 
WE DON T TAKE IT OUT IN THE RAIN SO THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS HAVE NOT BEEN USED 
WE DON T USE ANY COMMUNICATION AND DO NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM OR DO WE LISTEN TO THE AUDIO 
WE DON T USE IT MUCH SO IT S NOT A PROBLEM 
WE DON T USE OUR PHONES IN THE CAR AS STATED ABOVE THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS UNSAFE TO OPERATE WHEN DRIVING POOR DESIGN FOR MAKING IN TRAVEL CHANGES 
WE DON T USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BECAUSE IT S VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE IT SOMETIMES IT WON T TAKE THE ADDRESS WE PUT INTO THE SYSTEM ALSO CAN T BE USED WHILE IN MOTION UNDERSTAND THE REASONING BEHIND IT BUT IF SOMEONE ELSE IS IN T 
WE DON T USE THIS SORRY
WE DRIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY TWICE A YEAR AND LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SO MUCH INFORMATION ABOUT RESTAURANTS RADIO STATIONS TRAFFIC AND WEATHER AS WE CHANGE AREAS 
WE ENJOY OUR TAHOE REALLY SURPRISED ABOUT THE BOSE SYSTEM THAT CAME WITH IT
WE ENJOY THE SIRIUS XM RADIO SYSTEM 
WE ENJOY THE SOUND QUALITY MUCH BETTER THAN ON PREVIOUS VEHICLES 
WE ENJOY VERY IMPORTANT 
WE ESPECIALLY LIKE THE SIDE COLLISION AVOIDANCE INDICATORS BLIND SPOTS WAS A CONCERN WHEN WE PURCHASED OUR 2015 ACURA TLX SINCE WE FELT OUR 2007 TL HAD A FEW 
WE EXPECTED THE STEREO TO BE MUCH LOUDER WITH THIS CAR AND SYSTEM OPTION THIS PARTICULAR MODEL HAD A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE SOUND OF THE STEREO/SPEAKERS 
WE FEEL EXCEPTIONAL SAFE DRIVING THE SRX HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO HUGE BLIND SPOTS LEFT AND RIGHT CAUSED BY THE PLACEMENT AND SIZE OF THE EXTERNAL REAR VIEW MIRRORS 
WE FEEL IT WAS A GREAT VALUE 
WE FEEL SAFE DRIVING OUR TAHOE 
WE FEEL SAFE IN IT AS WE HAVE IN ALL OUR JEEPS BEFORE
WE FEEL SAFE IN VEHICLE 
WE FEEL THE RADIO IS A HIGHER QUALITY THAN WITH MY PREVIOUS SUBARU 
WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE 
WE FEEL VERY SAFE IN OUR TRUCK!
WE FEEL VERY SAFE IN THE VEHICLE 
WE FEEL VERY SECURE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR AND BACKUP CAMERA ARE USEFUL AND HELPFUL
WE FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM VERY HARD TO USE I END UP USING MY IPHONE NAVIGATION INSTEAD OF THE CAR 
WE FIND VERY LITTLE TO DISLIKE ABOUT OUR NEW RAV4
WE FOUND THAT WE DIDN T HAVE MANY OF THE EXTRAS SOMEHOW EXPECTED MORE TO BE STANDARD
WE FOUND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO BE VERY EASY TO USE IT PROVIDED CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS
WE GOT AN INSURANCE ON OUR WINDOW THAT THE DEALER PUT A COATING OVER THE WINDOW THAT STRENGTHENS IT THIS KEEPS THE GLARE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND PERMANENT RAIN X 
WE GOT THE BASIC PACKAGE WHAT WE PAID FOR
WE HAD AN UNEXPECTED SNOW STORM THE DAY I DROVE MY NEW SUBARU HOME OTHER CARS WERE SLIDING AND HAVING ISSUES WITH THE SNOWY AND ICY ROADS I CRUISED ALL THE WAY HOME WITH MY MOM FOLLOWING ME IN HER SUBARU FORESTER WE BOTH MADE IT SAFE AND SOUND 
WE HAD SO MUCH INSTRUCTION ABOUT THE VEHICLE S FUNCTION WHEN WE TOOK DELIVERY WE JUST COULD NOT ACCEPT MUCH MORE SO THE FUNCTIONING OF THESE FUNCTIONS WERE NOT REALLY COVERED I THINK WITH MORE PERSONAL INSTRUCTION I WOULD HAVE HAD AN EASIER TIM 
WE HAD THE BACK UP CAMERA INSTALLED TO BOOST OUR SAFETY FEATURES SINCE WE HAVE 2 LITTLE ONES 
WE HAD TO APPLY RAIN EX TO THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR WINDOW AND SIDE MIRROR OTHERWISE THE WATER FLOW OBSCURED MIRROR VISIBILITY
WE HAD TO REMOVE THE HEADRESTS FROM THE BACK SEATS AS THEY BLOCKED REAR VISIBILITY QUITE A BIT 
WE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE LIGHTS THE FIRST TIME
WE HAD TROUBLE WORKING THE DVD PLAYER 
WE HAVE 2 OTHER CARS THEREFORE THE LIMITED RANGE OF THE LEAF IS NO PROBLEM FOR ME I CHOSE NOT TO HAVE THE FAST CHARGE OPTION SINCE IT APPEARS TO HURT THE BATTERY AND I DO NOT INTEND TO USE THE CAR FOR LONG DISTANCES I HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR FOR 
WE HAVE A BACKUP CAMERA BUT NO BEEP WARNING
WE HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME REMEMBER ING ALL THE COMMANDS PERHAPS AN OPTION TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILED PROMPTS WOULD HELP THEN ONCE THE USER BECOMES MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE COMMANDS THIS OPTION COULD BE TURNED OFF 
WE HAVE ALOT OF SUN IN THE MORNING AND EVENING COMMUTE NEED BETTER SUN VISORS SUN IS IN MY EYES !!!
WE HAVE ENJOYED THIS VEHICLE AND HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT THIS TIME 
WE HAVE HAD A MAZDA TRIBUTE PREVIOUSLY BUT THIS MINI VAN IS TERRIFIC MOST COMFORTABLE AND GOOD LOOKING 
WE HAVE LANE CHANGE ASSIST WHICH IS GREAT
WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND A USB PORT IN THE CAR WE ARE NOT SURE IF IT HAS ONE WE STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW TO CHANGE THE CLOCK AND THE OWNERS MANUAL HAS NOT HELPED 
WE HAVE NO NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN OUR VEHICLE
WE HAVE NOT DRIVEN THE CAR LONG ENOUGH TO REALLY GIVE A RATING
WE HAVE NOT HAD THIS VEHICLE LONG ENOUGH TO USE THESE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS 
WE HAVE NOT USED A LOT OF THE FEATURES TO BE ABLE TO JUDGE THEM FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE OLDER & DO NOT USE A COMPUTER AT ALL THESE FEATURES WOULD BE HARD TO FIGURE OUT & NOT USEFUL 
WE HAVE NOT USED ALL THE FEATURES AVAILABLE NAVIGATION OR BLUETOOTH CONNECTIONS
WE HAVE NOT USED IT MUCH YET DID NOT PURCHASE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DUE TO THE COST OF THE PACKAGE IT CAME IN WOULD BE NICE IF IT COULD BE AS A MORE AFFORDABLE OPTION 
WE HAVE NOT USED IT YET
WE HAVE NOT USED TYHE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM TO ANY DEGREE EXCEPT FOR THE RADIO AND GAS USE SCREEN 
WE HAVE ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR A SHORT TIME AND HAVE NOT USED A LOT OF THE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE TO US 
WE HAVE OWNED A SUBARU SINCE 1996 FOR WHERE WE LIVE IT S THE ONLY VEHICLE FOR US GREAT MPG GREAT SAFETY AND GREAT HANDLING IN SNOW AND ICE

WE LOVE THIS CAR!
WE MAY BE OLD BUT WE LOVE LIFE AND LOVE TO ROCK!
WE NEED TO GO BACK TO DEALER AND HAVE THEM GO OVER ALL THE FEATURES THEY DID WHEN WE FIRST GOT THE YUKON BUT NOW THAT WE ARE MORE FAMILIAR WITH IT TO GO OVER SOME THINGS WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR US 
WE NEED TO HAVE LADY PATTI AT TOYOTA GET OUR NEW CELL PHONES SET UP SHE OFFERED TO DO IT FOR US AFTER WE BECAME FAMILIAR WITH OUR NEW PHONES

WE NEED TO VIEW MORE STREETS ON THE SCREEN
WE NEVER GO OUT OF TOWN EXCEPT TO GO TO DOCTOR IN NC EVERY 4 MONTHS WE USUSALLY LISTEN TO FM RADIO WE DO NOT TEXT OR USE ANY INTERNET WE LOVE THIS CAR IT FITS US PERFECT ITS BODY IS BEAUTIFUL AND RUNS PERFECT FOR US
WE ONLY USE THE AM AND FM RADIO I FOUND SETTING THE CHOICE KEYS CONFUSING I THOUGHT I HAD THEM SET BUT THE NEXT TIME I DROVE THE CAR THEY WEREN T SET 
WE OPTED FOR THE BASE AUDIO SYSTEM RATHER THAN THE THX AUDIO SYSTEM THE SOUND QUALITY ON THE BASE SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED 
WE OWN THE TOURING MODEL CRV  THERE IS NO AUX JACK! HAD I KNOW THIS I MIGHT HAVE RECONSIDERED THIS PURCHASE  NO AUX JACK! THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN GENERAL IS AWEFUL SOMETHING THAT HAD WE KNOWN THE DIFFICULTY OF USING IT CERT 
WE PURCHASED OUR XF FOR A FAMILY CAR BECAUSE OF ITS SAFETY FEATURES AND RATINGS 
WE PURCHASED THE LIGHTING PACKAGE AND THE HEAD LIGHTS ARE THE BEST BY FAR THAT I VE EVER EXPERIENCED 
WE PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE OF HOW SAFE WE FEEL IT IS AND WE ARE NOT DISAPPOINTED 
WE RE 98% IN TOWN HAVE NOT USED IT MUCH 
WE RE A HYUNDAI FAMILY OWN A 2009 SANTE FE AND THE 2013 & 2015 TUSCANS THE FORWARD VISIBILITY IS DEFINITELY BETTER IN THE SANTE FE I VE NOTICED IN THE TUSCANS THE BLIND SPOTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD ARE LARGER DUE TO THE WINDSHIELD 
WE RE BETTER OFF USING GOOGLE MAPS RATHER THEN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE CAR IT S NOT AFFECTIVE VERY HARD TO GET LOCATION IN THE SYSTEM
WE RE STILL GETTING USE TO IT 
WE RE STILL GETTING USED TO THE CAR THE OWNER S MANUAL IS POORLY DONE IT ISN T ORGANIZED IN A CLEAR AND HELPFUL MANOR AND IS PRACTICALLY UNUSABLE 
WE RE STILL NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU THE MOST HELPFUL INSIGHT
WE REALLY DON T USE IT 
WE REALLY HAVEN T USED IT VERY MUCH SO IT IS HARD TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS 
WE REALLY HOPE THIS CAR CAN HAVE THE CHANGE OF LANES ASSISTANCE LIKE OUR 2014 ES 350 
WE REALLY LIKE THE SMALL WINDOWS ON THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE ELIMINATES ANY BLIND SPOT 
WE REALLY LOVE THE THE QUALITY OF SOUND COMING FROM THE FM HD CHANNELS WE REALLY LIKE HOW THE RADIO SWITCHED AUTOMATICALLY FROM STANDARD RADIO TO HD RADIO PLUGGING IN A USB STICK WITH MUSIC ON IT IS VERY EASY 
WE RECENTLY DROVE THE CAR OVER 3 000 MILES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN ON A WIDE VARIETY OF ROADS AND IN NUMEROUS DRIVING CONDITIONS THE CAR WAS RELIABLE AND COMFORTABLE WE WERE DELIGHTED WITH THE HANDLING AND PERFORMANCE AND FELT SAFE AND SECURE THR 
WE REMOVED THE REAR HEADRESTS FOR BETTER REARWARD VISIBILITY THEY CAN BE EASILY REPLACED WHEN WE CARRY ANYONE IN THE REAR SEAT WHICH IS VERY RARE 
WE SAW NO NEGATIVES ONLY POSITIVES 
WE STILL WANT TO PLAY CDS ON LONG TRIPS AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AT THE SAME TIME THE KIDS WATCH A MOVIE 
WE TEND TO USE GOOGLE MAPS ON OUR PHONE JUST BECAUSE IT IS SO EASY TO SET UP AND GO IT GETS A LITTLE PAINFUL WITH THE CURRENT ENTUNE SOFTWARE 
WE THINK THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE OUTSTANDING REALLY ENJOY THE REAR CAMERA COMES IN HANDY 
WE THINK WE WILL LOVE THE FEATURES BUT ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS WAS DIFFICULT BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT USED THE CAR MUCH YET WE DO MOST OF OUR DRIVING IN THE SPRING/SUMMER/FALL SO THE ANSWERS REFLECT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE USED THE CAR AT MOST 2 3 TIME 
WE USE THE AUDIO AND PHONE SYSTEMS DON T USE MUCH OF OTHER COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER THINGS HAS GREAT CAPABILITIES JUST NOT THAT TECH SAVY 
WE USE TO HAVE SUN VISORS THAT HAD EXTENSION SECTIONS IN THEM SO THAT YOU COULD MOVE THEM OVER IN FRONT OF THE SIDE WINDOWS THIS WAS GREAT FOR BLOCKING LATER AFTERNOON SUN WHILE DRIVING 
WE VE HAD A VERY RAINY SEASON HERE IN SAN ANTONIO TEXAS AND I WOULD VE LOVED TO HAVE SOME TIME OF WASHER FLUID OPTION FOR MY FRONT HEADLAMPS 
WE VE HAD ONSTAR FOR YEARS AND HAVE FOUND THE AUDI SYSTEM TO BE FAR SUPERIOR

WE VE NOT SPENT THE TIME LEARNING ALL YET WE ALSO HOPE TO ADD AFTER MARKET NAVIGATION SYSTEM EVENTUALLY 
WE VE NOTICED IT S HARD TO CHECK BLINDSPOTS AND HAVE HAD SOME CLOSE CALLS!
WE VERY MUCH ENJOY THE FIRST YEAR FREE SUBSCRIPTION TO SIRIUS AND ALL THE CHANNEL OPTIONS
WE VERY MUCH WANT THE SYSTEM TO BE UPDATED TO APPLE CAR PLAY WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE I WANT IT ASAP
WE WANT TO PLAY AUDIBLE BOOKS ON OUR I PAD THRU THE USB PORT AS WE USED TO DO IN OUR CHEV EQUINOX 
WE WANTED A VEHICLE THAT WOULD BE SAFER TO DRIVE ON LONG TRIPS THE STANDARD SAFETY FEATURES WORK GREAT AND WE PAY ATTENTION TO THEM BUT WE ALSO GOT THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM AND DAY OR NIGHT DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE OR LARGE DIVIDED HIGHWAYS GIVES 
WE WANTED LEATHER SEATS TO GET THEM WE HAD TO BUY ALL OF THE NAV/SOUND/PHONE ETC STUFF DON T USE IT MUCH WHEN DRIVING ALONE IT IS TOO MUCH TO HANDLE AND DRIVE IF THERE IS A PASSENGER MOST OF THE STUFF WON T WORK WHILE MOVING AND NO ONE W 
WE WERE AND STILL ARE VERY EXCITED TO LEARN ABOUT EVERYTHING ON OUR PRIUS THAT IS INCLUDED AND WE PAID FOR BUT WE BOTH WORK AND WE HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO GOT BACK TO THE DEALER TO BE TAUGHT HOW TO USE ALL OF THIS STUFF WE ARE OLDER EARLY 50S 
WE WERE IN A HORRIBLE ACCIDENT AND BARELY FELT A BUMP MY KIA IS AWESOME!
WE WERE SHOWN HOW TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND OTHER COMPONENTS AND I HAVE TO SAY SO FAR SO GOOD !
WE WERE SUPPOSE TO HAVE MORE APPS WITH THE 2015 INTELLILINK AND MYLINK ONE OF THE REASONS I WENT WITH GM AND IN VEHICLE 4G LTE ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE SYSTEM AND IT IMPENDING CABABILITIES WHAT IT HAS NOW IS VERY LACKING GM PLEASE BRING US APPLE 
WE WERE TRULY DISAPPOINTED WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT OUR OLDER VEHICLE HAD BETTER AUDIO FEATURES THAN THE NEW 2015 CHEVY TRAVERSE THERE IS NO BLUE TOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR THE PANDORA THAT WE LOVE TO LISTEN TO WE NOW DO NOT HAVE THAT FEATURE AT ALL 
WE WERE VERY SURPRISED THAT WE DO NOT FEEL WE ARE IN SUCH A SMALL CAR WE WERE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO USE IT ON THE FREEWAY WE HAVE A VOLVO AS WELL BUT WE FEEL SAFE AND SECURE ON THE FREEWAY THE YELLOW COLOR HELPS 
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAD A MORE THOROUGH EXPLANATION OF HOW THESE SYSTEMS WORK FROM THE DEALER WHEN WE BOUGHT THE CAR 
WE WOULD PREFER THE OLD KNOBS AND DIALS ON OUR 2010 EQUINOX 
WEAK VOLUME EXCESSIVE HIGHS AT DEFAULT AND MINIMAL BASS TINNY SOUND QUALITY 
WEAKEST PART OF VEHICLE

WELL LAYED OUT NAVIGATION CONTROLS I DO NOT LIKE THAT YOU CANNOT ENTER A ADDRESS INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING THIS IS NONSENSE 
WELL SATISFIED
WELL SPEAKERS SOUND LIKE SHIT N I DONT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM N REALLY IM JUST UNHAPPY OF THE CAR
WELL SUN VISORS SEEM A BIT SMALL 
WELL THAT IS A TOSS UP VISIBILITY IS A PLUS BUT DRIVING ON A WINDY OR RAINY DAY CAR SEEM LIKE IT LACKS STABILITY TRACTION WISE 
WELL THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS DON T WORK SO THAT DOESN T HELP MATTERS 
WELL THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS PRETTY POOR THE OTHER IS THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WILL BE OUT OF DATE IN A FEW YEARS SO YOU HAVE A CAR WITH A DAMAGED RESALE VALUE THE GIMIC FEATURES ARE SIMPLY NOT WORTH IT NONE OF THEM ADD MUCH SIRIUS IS PROB 
WELL THIS IS NOT THE ONLY AUTO MAKER THAT HAS THIS PROBLEM BUT WHAT GIVES WITH THE SMALL ALMOST USELESS VISORS I AM SURE THAT THEY CAN INVEST A FEW MORE DOLLARS FOR AN INTERNAL EXTENSION TO THE VISORS LIKE OTHER VEHICLE S DO 
WELL THOUGHT OUT AND OBVIOUSLY TESTED AT THE TRACK 
WELL THOUGHT OUT AND THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE STATE OF THE ART
WELL THOUGHT OUT TRUCK 
WELL WHEN I FIRST GOT MY CAR THE ONSTAR MODULE WENT BAD AND I HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS TO GET A NEW ONE INSTALLED 
WENT FROM AN SUV TO A CAR SO VISIBILITY IS MUCH LOWER
WENT ON A TRIP AND ONSTAR DIDN T WORK AT ALL IT NEEDED A NEW SENDING UNIT 
WHAT AN EASY TO USE SYSTEM!! EVERYTHING IS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EASY TO FIGURE OUT THE SOUND QUALITY FROM THE INFINITY SYSTEM IS ASTOUNDING I LOVE THAT YOU CAN PAUSE AND REWIND LIVE RADIO IN SATELLITE RADIO MODE THIS IS A VERY WELL DONE SYSTEM I 
WHAT CAR LOOKS LIKE
WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT ITS A NICE RIDE
WHAT EVER I WANT WHAT EVER THE GRANDKIDS WANT IT IS EASY TO DO AND THE QUALITY IS EXCEPTIONAL 
WHAT HAPPENED TO SEPARATE FOG CONTROL LIGHTS
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE RAIN SENSING WINDSHIELD WIPERS?????????????????
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SIDE SUN VISORS? THESE WERE USEFUL 
WHAT I DO NOT LIKE IS THE MEMORY SYSTEM OF CHANNELS IT IS FRUSTRATING TO USE 
WHAT I DON T LIKE ABOUT MY 2015 PRIUS AND DIDN T LIKE ABOUT MY 2007 PRIUS IS THE POOR VISIBILITY AT 10 00 & 2 00 WHEN LOOKING OUT FRONT WINDSHIELD ON DRIVER S SIDE THE CAR S FRAME GETS COMPLETELY IN THE WAY OF MY ABILITY TO SEE PEDESTRIANS ON A 
WHAT I DON T LIKE ABOUT THE VISIBILITY IS THE SIZE/LOCATION OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THEY ARE VERY LARGE AND BLOCK MY VIEW WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN 
WHAT I DON T LIKE IS THERE IS NO CD PLAYER OR SATELLITE I HAD TO BUY A SATELLITE SIRIUS XM RADIO FOR THE CAR 
WHAT I REALLY REALLY LIKE IS THE HANDS FREE SISTEM BECAUSE I CAN TALK AND ANSWER MY PHONE UPS I JUST NOTICE THAT IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR PAGES I ANSWERE UNACCEPTABLE IT WAS THE NUMBER 10 SORRY 
WHAT I USE IS VERY GOOD I JUST DO NOT USE ALL THAT IS AVAILABLE 
WHAT MY VEHICLE APPEARS TO HAVE IS NEW CONTROL CENTER TECHNOLOGY IN CONJUNCTION WITH OLDER MORE MANUAL CONTROLS WHICH MEANS THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO WAYS TO ACCOMPLISH MOST FUNCTIONS WHILE IT MAY SOUND DESIRABLE TO HAVE MULTIPLE CONTROLS FOR SOME 
WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL FROM THE STEERING WHEEL IS LIMITED BUT I HAVE NOT TRIED THE VOICE CONTROL FEATURES 
WHATEVER
WHEEL
WHEEL DESIGN AND COLOR
WHEEL SHIFTERS
WHEEL STYLE
WHEELS
WHEEZILING NOISE FROM PASSENGER WINDOW AS THOUGH AIR COMING IN WHILE ON FREEWAY 
WHEN [PARKING THE FRONT END OF CAR IS NOT VISIBLE NEEDS A FRONT CAMREA OR MSOME SORT OF ANTENNA TO LET ONE KNOW HOW CLOSE ONE MIGHT TO AQNY OBJECT S CARS ETC 
WHEN 3RD ROW UP IT MAKES IT HARDER TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW AND THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE HEAD RESTS UP 
WHEN A DIFFERENT ROUTE IS TAKEN SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY UPDATES 
WHEN A SONG IS PLAYING ON THE RADIO IT WOULD BE NICE IF INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SONG ARTIST TITLE YEAR WERE AUTOMATICALLY DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN ALL AT ONCE RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO THROUGH A FEW SCREENS AND THEN FIND SOME SKIMPY BIT OF NEAR 
WHEN A TEXT COMES IN THE ANNOUNCEMENT IS TOO QUIET FOR THE FIRST FEW SECONDS
WHEN ANY DEVICE IS HOOKED UP WHETHER ITS THROUGH BLUETOOTH OR USB I WISHED THE SOUND QUALITY WAS THE SAME AS WHEN I PLAY THE RADIO OR SATELLITE RADIO SOUND QUALITY IS COMPROMISED WHEN USING THE FEATURE 
WHEN APROACHING SIGNAL LIGHTS HAVE TO STOP A FEW STEP BACK TO SEE THE CHANGING OF GREEN 
WHEN ASKING SYSTEM TO CALL SOMEONE THE SYSTEM HEARS A DIFFERENT NAME REGARDLESS OF HOW CLEARLY I SPEAK
WHEN ASKING TO CALL SOMEBODY THE TELEPHONE GAL NEVER UNDERSTANDS WHAT I AM SAYING
WHEN AT A STOP LIGHT AT CROSS BAR SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LEAN DOWN YO SEE LIGHT 
WHEN AT A STOP LIGHT I CAN T SEE THE TOP OF THE TRAFFIC LIGHT AND THE SEAT IS AS LOW AS IT WILL GO 
WHEN AT AN INTERSECTION IT S VERY HARD TO SEE TO THE RIGHT
WHEN ATTACHING IPHONE IT DEFAULTS TO IPOD MUSIC INSTEAD OF ACTIVE APP SUCH AS AUDIBLE EVEN IF AUDIBLE IS PLAYING 
WHEN BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS ARE UP IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT THE SIDES 
WHEN BACKING IF PARKING ASSIST IS ON SEAT CONTINUES TO VIBRATE EVEN WHEN BACKING IN A PASTURE
WHEN BACKING INTO PARKING SPACE WHICH I DO DAILY CANNOT SEE PARKING LINES UNLESS YOU TILT MIRROR DOWN 8 AUDIO SCREEN TOO BRIGHT AT ALL TIMES UNLESS YOU TURN IT DOWN WHICH LOWERS THE VISIBILITY OF YOU R DASH/SPEEDOMETER LIGHTING VERY DISTRAC 
WHEN BACKING IT IS HARD FOR ME TO SEE PAST THE PILLARS BETWEEN THE DOORS AND AROUND HEADREST
WHEN BACKING OUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE ONCOMING TRAFFIC 
WHEN BACKING OUT ITS VERY HARD TO SEE THRU THE RIGHT REAR WINDOW PARTIALLY BECAUSE OF THE HEAD REST AND PASSENGER SEAT SETTING
WHEN BACKING OUT LOOKING OUT TOWARDS THE PASSENGERS SIDE THE VIEW IS BLOCKED BY THE PILLAR AND IF THERE IS A PASSENGER IT IS EVEN WORSE IN THE FRONT SEAT
WHEN BACKING OUT OF DRIVE WAY OR PARKING SPACE THE PASSENGER HEADREST IS A BILL BOARD THAT OBSTRUCTS YOU VIEW ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A PASSENGER AND PUT THERE HEAD INTO THE PICTURE 
WHEN BACKING OUT OF DRIVEWAY I HAVE HAD A HARD TIME SEEING CARS COMING FROM MY RIGHT THIS IS MY 2ND ESCAPE IT COULD VERY WELL BE ME AND JUST NOT TURNING MY NECK COMPLETLY TO SEE TRAFFIC 
WHEN BACKING OUT OF DRIVEWAY VISION ON PASSENGER SIDE IS OBSTRUCTED
WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACES IT S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO TRULY SEE EVERYTHING BEHIND ME PERHAPS THIS IS DUE TO THE ABBREVIATED SIZE OF THE REAR WINDOW BECAUSE IT S PART OF THE REAR DOOR ?
WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPOT OR DRIVEWAY THERE IS A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER THE PASSENGER SIDE VIEW 
WHEN BACKING OUT OF SOME PARKING SPACES THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS THESE BLIND SPOTS ARE SMALLER THAN IN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER COUPS I HAVE DRIVEN THE BACKUP CAMERA S WIDE VIEW ALSO HELPS WITH THIS PROBLEM 
WHEN BACKING OUT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT THAT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN LOOKING OUT THE SIDE OF THE CAR WHERE THE WINDSHIELD IS I VE ALMOST HIT 3 CARS BACKING OUT 
WHEN BACKING OUT VISION IS OBSCURED BY PASSENGER SEATBACK AND CENTER POST IF THERE IS A PASSENGER IT S EVEN WORSE 
WHEN BACKING UP AND TURNING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE DARKENED BACK WINDOWS THE BACK UP CAMERA IS OK BUT I STILL LIKE TO LOOK FOR MYSELF TO CHECK FOR TRAFFIC 
WHEN BACKING UP I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE DIRECTLY BEHIND ME 
WHEN BACKING UP IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE TO THE BACK RIGHT OF THE VEHICLE FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC 
WHEN BACKING UP IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY ON THE REVERSE CAMERA WHICH I AM NOT VERY COMFORTABLE WITH 
WHEN BACKING UP IT IS HARD TO LOOK OUT THE BACK BECAUSE OF THE GAP BETWEEN WINDOWS OF THE REAR WINDOW AND THE SIDE WINDOWS THE HEAD LIGHTS WORK VERY WELL AND THE FOG LIGHTS WORK EXCELLENT IN THE FOG 
WHEN BACKING UP IT S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SEE IF ANY TRAFFIC IS COMING WHEN I LOOK TO MY RIGHT SIDE THE DIVISION BETWEEN THE FRONT RIGHT PASSENGER WINDOW AND THE BACK YEAR PASSENGER WINDOW ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE BLOCKING MY VIEW I M ONLY 5 FT TALL 
WHEN BACKING UP IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS WOULD TILT DOWNWARD MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO SEE THE GROUND AS THE VEHICLE IS BACKING UP OUR 2007 CHRYSLER 300 HAD THIS FEATURE THIS IS A SAFETY FEATURE 
WHEN BACKING UP OR CHANGING LANES I FOUND THERE TO BE WAY TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS FROM THE FRONT CORNER WHEN LOOKING FORWARD TO HEN BACKING UP THE WIDE HEAD RESTS AND THE BACK CORNER I FIND MYSELF TRIPLE CHECKING AND LEANING OVER TO LOOK AROUND 
WHEN BACKING UP REAR VISIBILITY NEEDS IMPROVING HAS MANY BLIND SPOTS 
WHEN BACKING UP THE WARNING BEEP BECOMES PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER AND MORE FREQUENT CAUSING ME TO STOP FAR SHORT OF ANY OBSTACLE WHICH MIGHT BE IN LINE CAN T THIS WARNING SIGNAL BE ADJUSTED TO ALLOW THE DRIVER TO UTILIZE ALL AVAILABLE SAFE SPACE?
WHEN BACKING UP VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR 
WHEN BLUETOOTH IS CONNECTED CANNOT GET AUDIO COMMANDS FOR OTHER SYSTEMS TO WORK 
WHEN BRAKING AT A SPEED HIGHER THAN 50MPH THE REAR JERKED 
WHEN CALLING SOMEONE WITH MULTIPLE NUMBERS THERE ARE TOO MANY STEPS TO GET TO THE NUMBER YOU WANT YOU CAN T JUST SAY MOM/MOBILE 
WHEN CAR IS COLD SPEAKERS HAVE A ROUGH SOUND WITH ANY AUDIO UNTIL THE VEHICLE WARMS UP VERY ANNOYING SOUNDS LIKE OLD DAMAGED SPEAKERS 
WHEN CAR IS WASHED WATER LATER COMES OUT OF THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS AND GETS BACK ON THE CAR WHEN DRIVING LEAVING WATER SPOTS
WHEN CHANGING LANES AND A VEHICLE IS IN THE BLIND SPOT AND I HAVE NOT NOTICED THE LIGHT ON THE SIDE MIRROR IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE AND AUDIBLE ALARM TO ALERT ME SOMETIMES CHANGING LANES IS A QUICK DECISION WHICH CAN LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT 
WHEN CHANGING LANES B PILLAR IS THE OBSTACLE BUT THE BLIND SPOT WARNING MAKES THE DIFFERENCE 
WHEN CHANGING LANES BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT HAND SIDE MAKES IT HARD TOSEE A CAR COMING 
WHEN CHANGING LANES I HAVE A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES SO NOT TO HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE 
WHEN CHANGING LANES I HAVE TO LEAN FORWARD I M INSTALLING A FISH EYE
WHEN CHANGING LANES I NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL DUE TO THE I HAVE A VERY LARGE BLIND AREA ON MY LEFT SIDE BASICALLY I DISLIKE THE SHAPE OF THE OUTSIDE MIRROR
WHEN CHANGING LANES IN A VERY BUSY FREEWAY IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE FROM DRIVER TO PASSENGER REAR SITE DUE TO HEADREST OF REAR LEFT SIDE MUST USE RIGHT REAR VIEW MIRROR FOR ME THERE IS A BLIND SPOT AS DRIVER TURNS HEAD TO SEE OVER SHOULDER TO 
WHEN CHANGING LANES LOOKING RIGHT OR LEFT IS CHALLENGING 
WHEN CHANGING LANES OR REVERSING IT IS COMPLICATED TO SEE PAST THE INTERIOR SEATING HEADRESTS 
WHEN CHANGING LANES THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN MERGING LEFT 
WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE LEFT I FEEL THAT I CAN T SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE LANE THERE IS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT AND IT IS A BIT SCARY 
WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE LEFT IT IS VERY VERY HARD TO DETERMINE IF SOMEONE IS IN THE BLIND SPOT 
WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT HARD TO SEE IF VEHICLE THERE
WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING
WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT SOMEWHAT OF A BLINDSPOT OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER 
WHEN CHANGING LANES YOU HAVE TO PHYSICALLY CHECK REAR BLIND SPOT BY TURNING AROUND AND LOOKING BACK
WHEN CHECKING FOR BLIND SPOT VISIVILITY IS BLOCK BY REAR SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
WHEN COMING OFF PRIVATE ROAD TO MAIN ROAD AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 30 DEGREES FROM LEFT SIDE OF MAIN ROAD IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY VEHICLES COMING DUE TO MAJOR BLIND SPOT!
WHEN CONNECTED BLUETOOTH ONLY MAKE CALLS CANNOT STREAM PANDORA STUPID
WHEN CONNECTED TO BLUETOOTH AND HAVING ANSWERED A PHONE CALL OFTEN HAVE TO PRESS TRANSFER CALL BECAUSE IT IS STUCK IN A LIMBO OF SORTS 
WHEN CONNECTED TO MEDIA THERE IS NO CONTROL TO PLAY MUSIC THROUGH CD BLUE TOOTH OR USB PORT 
WHEN CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH THE SOUND QUALITY IS DISTORTED SLIGHTLY ESPECIALLY WITH 3RD PARTY APPS LIKES SPOTIFY 
WHEN CONNECTING A CELLPHONE THRU BLUETOOTH IT SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT SAID CELLPHONE HAS EXIT THE CAR E G W THE PASSENGER AND INTERRUPT THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION OTHERWISE CONNECTION CONTINUES AND MUSIC CUTS IN AND OUT UNTIL IT DROPS COMPLETELY 
WHEN CONNECTING A PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH THERE SHOULD BE MORE OPTIONS THAN JUST MAKING AND RECEIVING PHONE CALLS LIKE PLAYING MUSIC 
WHEN CONNECTING FROM IPAD SOUND NEEDS TO BE TURNED UP ALL THE WAY AND ON SOME RECORDINGS STILL DOES NOT COME THROUGH PROPERLY IF I LISTEN DIRECTLY TO IPAD USING EARPHONES OR IPAD SPEAKER IT IS FINE 
WHEN CONNECTING IPHONE VIA BLUETOOTH IT CAN TAKE UP TO 30 40 SECONDS TO DOWNLOAD PHONE CONTACTS TO ME THAT SEEMS TOO LONG AS I DON T HAVE MORE THAN 30 CONTACTS OR SO THE SYSTEM IS UNABLE TO PLAY MUSIC DURING THAT TIME 
WHEN CONNECTING MY IPOD VIA EITHER BLUETOOTH OR USB IT IS CUMBERSOME TO FIND PLAYLISTS OR ARTISTS
WHEN CONNECTING MY PHONE IT IS QUITE DIFFICULT TO KEEP PHONE CONNECTED TO PLAY MUSIC WHICH IS WHY I DON T USE THE PORT CONNECTION VERY OFTEN 
WHEN CONNECTING TO AN AUX IPOD PHONE THE VOLUME IS NOT CONSISTENT GO TO FULL LOAD 
WHEN CONNECTING TO BLUETOOTH AND USING VOICE RECOGNITION I DO NOT LIKE THAT SO MANY CHOICES COME ON THE SCREEN AND THEN I AM ASKED TO CHOOSE ONE TO CALL I DON T UNDERSTAND WHY ALL THESE OTHER NAMES APPEAR 
WHEN CONNECTING TO BLUETOOTH OR MEDIA INTERFACE CORD THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM CHANGES TO THAT AUDIO OPTION I WOULD LIKE TO USE THE MEDIA CORD FOR CHARGING SOMETIMES AND NOT WANT TO CHANGE JUST BECAUSE I PLUGGED IT IN SAME WITH BLUETOOTH I MAY C 
WHEN CONNECTING TO PHONE HANDS FREE YOU CAN BARELY HEAR THE TONE OF THE PHONE CONNECTION FOR VOICE ACTIVATION OF CALLS OR OTHERWISE
WHEN CONNECTING TO USB WITH MEDIA DEVICE SOMETIMES THE DEVICE WILL NOT CHARGE NOT SURE IF IT S A CABLE ISSUE OR SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE PORT 
WHEN CONNECTING YOUR PERSONAL DEVICE THROUGH AUXILIARY CABLE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THE SAME VOLUME YOU ARE FROM REGULAR RADIO WHICH MAKES CERTAIN APPLICATIONS SOMEWHAT HARD TO HEAR THOUGH IT IS ONLY A MINOR PROBLEM 
WHEN CROSSING OVER LANES TO TURN ONCOMING CARS CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING BLOCKED BY THE RIGHT SIDE BAR BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND SIDE WINDOW ONLY DIFFICULT WHEN ON AN ANGLE TO TURN 
WHEN DELETING THE SECONDARY ENABLED DEVICE IT SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT TO PRIMARY DEVICE WITHOUT HAVING TO FORCE IT 
WHEN DOING A RIGHT LANE CHANGE AND SHOULDER CHECK I OFTEN MISTAKE ONE OF THE INNER PANELS FOR A VEHICLE I CATCH IT IN MY PERIPHERAL VISION AND HAVE TO DO A DOUBLE TAKE TO MAKE SURE IT S NOT ANOTHER VEHICLE I M NOT SURE IF IT S SIMPLY BECAUSE I 
WHEN DOING SEARCH BY NAME IS CONFUSING
WHEN DRIVER LOOKS TO THE LEFT FOR ON COMING TRAFFIC OR FOR LANE CHANGING IT IS HARD TO SEE DUE TO THE LARGE FRAME WORK BETWEEN THE DRIVER SIDE WIDOW AND THE 2ND ROW WINDOW SEAT 
WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT IN LOW LIGHTING SITUATIONS DARK AREA WHEN TURNING LEFT UNABLE TO SEE WHERE I AM TURNING 
WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT IN THE DARK THE TOP HALF OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS DARK YOU CANNOT SEE THROUGH THE TOP HALF OF THE WINDSHIELD UNLESS YOU USE YOUR BRIGHTS YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE GROUND AND NOT ANYTHING ABOVE EYE LEVEL LIKE STREET SIGNS 
WHEN DRIVING HARD TO FIND THE CHANNEL YOU WANT ON SIRIUS RADIO AND SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN RADIO CD MEDIA SETTING WHILE WATCHING THE ROAD
WHEN DRIVING IN HEAVY RAIN THE VEHICLE IS SO LOW THAT IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WITH ONCOMING TRAFFIC THE LIGHT REFLECTION OFF THE WET PAVEMENT PLUS THE LOW PROFILE OF THE VEHICLE MADE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE 
WHEN DRIVING IN THE SNOW I FEEL LIKE IT IS SOLID AS A ROCK 
WHEN DRIVING IT APPEARS THAT THE DESIGNERS THOUGHT EVERYONE WOULD OPT FOR THE LANE CHANGING TECHNOLOGY ITS HARD TO SEE VEHICLES IN YOUR BLIND SPOTS WHICH ON THIS VEHICLE ARE QUITE LARGE OK THE BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGER THAN THE OLD 626 THAT WE U 
WHEN DRIVING LOOKING TO THE RIGHT SEEMS SEMI BLOCKED BY THE HUGE HEAD RESTRAINTS
WHEN DRIVING ON CURVES TURNING TO THE LEFT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE ONCOMING VEHICLES DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE METAL PIECE BETWEEN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND THE SIDE WINDOW
WHEN DRIVING OVER A BUMP THERE IS SOME UNSTEADY ESSENTIAL IN THE REAR WHEELS 
WHEN DRIVING PEOPLE OFTEN TELL ME THEY CAN T HEAR ME VERY WELL WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE SYSTEM 
WHEN DRIVING SOME DIFFICULTY IN SEEING AROUND COLUMNS OF WINDSHIELD
WHEN DRIVING THE FEEL THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL IS PRECISE AND YOU KNOW YOU ARE DRIVING A QUALITY BUILT CAR 
WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE I FEEL SAFE LIKE NOTHJNG IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME IF IN AN ACCIDENT
WHEN DRIVING UP AND HILL AND TURNING LEFT THE SIDE DRIVER S MIRROR BLOCKS VISIBILITY OF THE STREET I AM TURNING LEFT ON TO MY STREET SO THIS IS A DAILY OCCURRENCE 
WHEN ENTERING A NUMBER TO DIAL A CALL IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE IT HAPPEN MORE QUICKLY
WHEN ENTERING A ROAD FROM A JUGHANDLE BLIND SPOT IS VERY DIFFICULT
WHEN ENTERING ADDRESSES IN THE NAVIGATION PROVIDE THE OPTION TO EDIT THE NAMES/NUMBERS OF STREETS WITHOUT HAVING THE DELETE THE ENTIRE ENTRY YOU CANNOT MOVE THE CURSOR TO A SPECIFIC LOCATION TO EDIT YOU HAVE TO DELETE THE ENTIRE ENTRY FOR EXAMP 
WHEN ENTERING AN ADDRESS HAVE TYPE AHEAD FEATURES TO BETTER IDENTIFY THE DESIRED ADDRESS WITH MULTIPLE OPTIONS I LIVE CLOSE TO THE NC SC BORDER IT CAN T FIND AN ADDRESS A COUPLE OF MILES AWAY IN SC BECAUSE IT ONLY SEARCHES IN NC 
WHEN ENTERING AN ADDRESS THE SYSTEM TRIES TO GUESS WHAT YOU ARE ENTERING WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE SET UP MORE LIKE GARMAN NAVIGATION SYSTEMS SOMETIMES IT WILL NOT LET YOU ENTER AN ADDRESS BECAUSE OF THIS 
WHEN ENTERING ANOTHER LANE TO LEFT LOOKING FROM SHOULDER IS NOT THAT VISIBLE I THINK THE SIZE OF THE CAR MAKES IT LITTLE DIFFICULT 
WHEN ENTERING DESTINATION THE KEYBOARD TOUCH CONTROL DOES NOT RESPOND WELL YOU HAVE TO HOLD DOWN ON THE LETTER FIRMLY FOR A LONG TIME
WHEN FIRST RECEIVED WASHER FLUID PORT ON DRIVER SIDE BLOCKED 
WHEN FULLY FUNCTIONING IT IS OUTSTANDING EASY TO USE AND EASY TO HEAR A GREAT SYSTEM 
WHEN GETTING A CALL IT IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE PARTY CALLING 
WHEN GETTING IN THE CAR IT IS RIDICULOUS HOW FAR BACK THE SEATBELT IS LOCATED FRONT SEATS 
WHEN GIVING A COMMAND I FEEL I HAVE TO YELL INTO SCREEN IN BOTH CARS THAT HAVE THIS AND OFTEN NEED TO REPEAT
WHEN GLANCING AT SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THERE IS A CONSTANT MIRROR REFLECTION ON SURFACE OF MIRROR THUS YOU GET AN IMAGE OF PART OF DRIVER DOOR AT ALL TIMES WHEN LOOKING OUT OF SAID SIDE VIEW MIRROR 
WHEN GOING AROUND BENDS TO THE RIGHT PASSENGER SIDE THE VISION IS OBSCURED BY THE REAR VIEW MIRROR 
WHEN HAVING HEAVY RAINS AND THE WIPERS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR IS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE 
WHEN HDFM IS RECEIVING AND HOLDING THE SIGNAL IT IS TRULY OUTSTANDING BUT HDFM FADES IN AND OUT QUITE FREQUENTLY!!!!!
WHEN HEAD REST FOR PASSENGER SEAT IS RAISED SIDE REAR VISIBILITY IS RESTRICTED

WHEN YOU LOWER S/WHEEL HARD TO SEE SPEED YOU ARE GOING

WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD TO SEE IN YOUR BLIND SPOTS YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING UNLIKE OTHER CARS WHERE IT S DIFFICULT

WHEN YOU USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT PUTS THE DIRECTIONS ON THE DISPLAY DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER SO YOU DON T HAVE TO LOOK AT THE MAIN MAP DISPLAY TO SEE WHERE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GO THAT MAKES THE SYSTEM EVEN SAFER AND MORE USER FRIENDLY 
WHENEVER I ENTER MY AUDI A5 IT AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTS TO MY PHONE THROUGH BLUETOOTH 
WHENEVER SWITCHING MEDIA DEVICES THE VOLUME HAS TO BE TURNED TO ACTIVATE 
WHENEVER THE IPHONE IS CONNECTED VIA USB IT AUTOMATICALLY STARTS PLAYING MUSIC OUT OF ITUNES MORE OF AN APPLE PROBLEM I SUPPOSE NOT UNIQUE TO THIS VEHICLE 
WHENICEY OUTSIDE IT SEEMS HARD TO KEEP WIPERS FROM FREEZING ! THEY ARE VERY LOW BELOW THE AIRFLOW OF WINDSHIELD
WHERE ARE THE MIRRORS IN THE CARGO AREA FOR REAR LANE CHANGING LIKE IN THE 2007 VERSION?
WHERE I FIND THE SUN VISOR ALITTLE TOO BIG IT DOES IT GIVE BETTER COVERAGE

WHERE YOU PLUG IN YOUR PHONE TO CHARGE ITS IN A VERY VERY ODD PLACE YOU CAN NOT GET TOP IT WHY DO I HAVE TO OPEN A COMPARTMENT AND LEAVE IT OPEN TO CHARGE MY PHONE ITS TERRIBLE PLACE YOU CAN T EVEN REACH IT
WHETHER IT S DUE TO HOW I HAVE MY DRIVER S SEAT ADJUSTED OR SOMETHING ELSE I DON T FIND THE SUN VISOR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS I D LIKE FOR SOME REASON I NEVER SEEM TO GET MORE THAN 70% BLOCKAGE OF SUNLIGHT WHETHER THE VISOR 
WHETHER USING VOICE CONTROLS OR MANUAL CONTROLS THE SYSTEMS ARE ERGONOMICALLY DESIGNED 
WHICH THE PROCESSER WOULD BE FASTER AND THE SCREEN BIGGER 
WHILE AT WORK I THINK ABOUT GETTING IN MY MAZDA3 AND SHIFT GEARS AWAY DRIVING THIS 155HP ENGINE WITH MANUAL TRANSMISSION IS PROBABLY THE MOST DESIRABLE THING THAT I HAVE EVER WANTED

WHILE CHANGING LANES AND LOOKING OVER PACK RIGHT CORNER BEHIND 2ND ROW SEAT THERE IS A SMALL BLIND SPOT THAT OFTEN LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER VEHICLE 
WHILE CHANGING LANES I AM NOT GETTING A GOOD VIEW OF VEHICLES COMING ON THE LEFT LANE 
WHILE CHANGING LANES ON THE HIGHWAY I NEARLY HIT A VEHICLE THAT WAS IN MY BLIND SPOT I THINK ALL VEHICLES SHOULD COME WITH WARNING DEVICES TO AVOID COLLISIONS LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING 
WHILE DRIVING I CANNOT LOOK OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER TO PEAR OUT THE LEFT REAR DOOR WINDOW TO SEE IF THERE IS A CAR IN MY BLIND SPOT ALSO I WISH THE FRONT PASSENGER HEADREST COULD BE LOWERED MORE SO THAT THE HEADREAST WOULD NOT OBSTRUCT MY VISION A

WHILE DRIVING IT IS HARD TO GET TO AND CHANGE THE BASS TREBLE FADE AND BALANCE AUDIO FEATURES PERHAPS YOU COULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO USE VOICE COMMANDS FOR CONTROLLING THESE AND OTHER FEATURES 
WHILE DRIVING IT IS PHENOMENAL 
WHILE DRIVING IT WOULD BE EASIER JUST TO HIT A BUTTON FOR AM/FM/SATELLITE INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT THE SCREEN
WHILE DRIVING MY PASSENGER CANNOT ENTER DATA INTO THE GPS SYSTEM WHICH IS A CONCERN BECAUSE I CANNOT SIMPLY JUST STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC TO INPUT INFO INTO THE GPS SYSTEM 
WHILE DRIVING NOT CONVENIENT TO CHANGE STATION
WHILE DRIVING NOT THAT EASY TO NAVIGATE THE OPTIONS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IN CERTAIN BRIGHT LIGHT ALSO NOT EASY TO READ THE SCREEN
WHILE DRIVING OVER 45 MPH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT WORK THAT WELL I THINK THEY ARE TOO LIGHT AND THEY DO NOT COMPLETELY WIPE THE AREA CLEAN OF WATER 
WHILE DRIVING SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS APPROACHING FROM RIGHT PASSENGER REAR SIDE 
WHILE DRIVING THERE IS A TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT LOOKING OUT THE PASSENGER REAR WINDOW I HAVE ALMOST BEEN IN NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS BECAUSE I CAN T SEE OUT OF THE REAR PASSENGER CORNER THIS IS PROBABLY MY ONLY REAL COMPLAINT AND IT EXISTED IN THE 201 
WHILE DRIVING WHEN LOOKING TO THE RIGHT SIDE THE DOOR FRAME NEXT TO THE SIDE MIRROR GETS IN THE WAY OF VISIBILITY

WHILE I AM GLAD THAT BMW NARROWED THE WIDTH OF THE X5 FROM THE 2013 MODEL IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THE NEW MODEL ACTUALLY FITS BUT JUST BARELY WIDTH WISE IN OUR GARAGE I DON T LIKE THE NARROW NESS FROM A ROLLOVER SAFETY STANDPOINT THE NAR

WHILE I DON T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL IT OFFERS I DO LIKE THE USB PORTS AND ALL OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ME 
WHILE I FEEL SAFE EVERYTHING IS WHAT I WOULD EXPECT IN ANY NEW VEHICLE TODAY ESPECIALLY A LUXURY VEHICLE I DO LOVE THE HEAVY FEELING OF THE VEHICLE 
WHILE I HAVE USED THE VOICE CONTROL I PREFER THE TOUCH SCREEN
WHILE I LIKE THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES THE MOST USEFUL FOR ME IS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND IN PARTICULAR THE FACT THAT THE DIRECTIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE PROVIDED WITHIN MY HEADS UP DISPLAY NO MORE HAVING TO SPEND A FEW SECOND 
WHILE I LIKE THE LARGE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THEY DO CREATE A BLIND SPOT WHEN TURNING LEFT WONDERING IF THE VISORS COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER AS THEY SOMETIMES AREN T LOW ENOUGH TO BLOCK SUN GLARE 
WHILE I LIKE THE LIGHT THAT COMES ON IN THE BLIND SPOT IN THE SIDE MIRRORS I STILL LIKED THE SMALL MIRRORS THAT WERE LOCATED ON THE SIDE MIRRORS IN PREVIOUS MODELS 
WHILE I LIKE THE SIDE MIRRORS THEY TEND TO BLOCK YOUR VISION AT TIMES 
WHILE I LIKE THE SIRIUS XM SYSTEM I WILL NOT USE IT BEYOND THE TRIAL PERIOD DUE TO THE POOR MARKETING STRATEGY AND EXCESSIVE COSTS OF THE SERVICE A BETTER OPTION WOULD BE TO OFFER THE RECEIVER AS AN EASILY INSTALLED OPTION FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT W

WHILE I THINK I HAVE SUFFICIENT VIEW OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW ITS NOT AS LARGE AS MY PREVIOUS SEDAN WOULD LIKE A BIT MORE FIELD OF VISION SINCE IT IS WHAT I WAS USED TO BUT OVERALL HAPPY 
WHILE I USE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA I STILL LOOK OUT THE BACK TO PARK AND WOULD THEREFORE LIKE A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE THE REAR OF THE CAR ENDS A FRONT VIEW CAMERA WOULD BE USEFUL FOR PARKING AND APPROACHING CURBS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THE LOWEST PA 
WHILE IN DRIVER SEAT I LIKE THE RADIO DISPLAY ON DASHBOARD NEXT TO SPEEDOMETER IT IS LESS DISTRACTING THAN LOOKING AT LARGER SCREEN TO THE RIGHT 
WHILE IN MOTION DIFFICULT TO USE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS
WHILE IT HAS SOME BLIND SPOTS SO DOES EVERY CAR BUT THE LANE CHANGE ASSIST WORKS PERFECTLY EXCEPT I DON T UNDERSTAND WHY IT DOESN T WORK BELOW 20 MPH IT SHOULD WORK REGARDLESS OF SPEED REAR HEADRESTS IN OUTBOARD POSITIONS ARE LARGER THAN MI 
WHILE IT IS PRETTY GOOD I FEEL IT COULD BE BETTER SUCH AS USING GOGGLE MAPS SIMILAR TO PANDORA VIA MY SMARTPHONE 
WHILE IT LOOKS GREAT THERE ARE SO MANY OPTIONS IT IS CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN DRIVING THE MAIN SILVER KNOB MOVES COUNTER CLOCKWISE TO SCROLL DOWN WHICH DRIVES ME CRAZY I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD BE CLOCKWISE I CONNECT MY IPOD OVERTIME 
WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC THE PICTURES FROM SONGS I HAVE DOWNLOADED DO NOT DISPLAY IT WILL JUST SHOW THE BLUETOOTH OR CD DEFAULT PICTURE THAT IS A HUGE LET DOWN FOR ME THERE ARE ENTIRELY WAY TOO MANY STEPS USING THE HANDS FREE OPTION TO MAKE A 
WHILE MAKING A SOFT LEFT TURN SOMETIMES THE END OF THE FRONT GLASS LEFT SIDE PANEL COMES IN THE WAY THAT YOU FEEL THAT YOU RE NOT SEEING THE FULL SPECT OF THE ROAD
WHILE MAKING NECESSARY TELEPHONE CALLS THE VOICE PROMPTS ARE GREAT I E INCOMING DIALED OR MISSED 
WHILE NEEDED THE BLIND SPOT MAGNIFIERS ON SIDE MIRRORS ARE DISTRACTING 
WHILE ON A CALL THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM IN THE CAR THE OUTSIDE NOISE COULD BE LESS I AM INSIDE THE CAR IF IT IS RAINING THEN THE OTHER PERSON ON THE CALL CAN HEAR THAT ON THE ROOF IF I AM TRAVELING AT A HIGHER SPEED ON THE HIGHWAY THE OT 
WHILE ON CELL PHONE AWAY FROM CALL THE CALL IS CHANGED AUTOMATICALLY TO BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IN CAR WHEN I GET IN CAR AND DRIVE AWAY
WHILE ON PHONE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND OFTEN MUFFLED 
WHILE ON THE TELEPHONE NAVIGATION DOES NOT TALK MAYBE BECAUSE I M PAIRED WITH IPHONE MISSED EXIT 
WHILE PLAYING MUSIC ON SATELLITE MUSIC THERE NEEDS TO BE AWAY FOR THE NAME OF THE SONG AND ARTIST TO SHOW UP ON THE SCREE
WHILE REAR VIEW FROM DRIVERS SEAT IS LIMITED DUE TO SIZE OF THE WINDOW THIS HAS NOT YET POSED A PROBLEM AND THE ADAS DEFINITELY PROVIDES COMFORT LEVEL WITH THE RESTRICTED VISIBILITY
WHILE SEEING OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW IS CHALLENGING THE MIRROR SYSTEM OF THE VEHICLE MAKES IT EASY TO SEE EVERYTHING AROUND THE VEHICLE 
WHILE STOPPING LOOKING RIGHT VISIBILITY HAS BLIND SPOT FOR ONCOMING CAR
WHILE THE BACK UP CAMERA DOES DISPLAY A COLLISION GRID AND PATH OF TRAVEL IT DOES NOT ALARM EITHER VISUALLY OR AUDIBLY WHEN AN OBJECT IS ABOUT TO BE STRUCK 
WHILE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM IS GREAT I HAVE RECENTLY DRIVEN A VEHICLE THAT HAS A TWO PIECE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR THAT PROVIDED EXCELLENT VISIBILITY OF THE BLIND SPOT AREA THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE INCLUDED ON FUTURE CHARGERS 
WHILE THE LARGE TOWING MIRRORS ARE USEFUL WHEN TOWING THEY DO CREATE A BLIND SPOT
WHILE THE LIGHTS ON MY LEXUS ARE UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL I WISH THE CLARITY WAS GREATER FOR MY HIGH BEAMS THERE IS NOT A DRASTIC CHANGE FROM THE REGULAR HEADLIGHT SETTING TO HIGH BEAMS 
WHILE THE MENU SCREEN IS RELATIVELY USER FRIENDLY IT COULD NONETHELESS BE EASIER FEWER SCREENS WITH MORE OBVIOUS ICONS WOULD BE HELPFUL 
WHILE THE REAR WINDOW AT FIRST APPEARS SMALL THE ASSISTANCE OF THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THE LIGHTS WHILE CHANGING LANES MAKE UP FOR IT 
WHILE THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE LARGE I WISH IT HAD ELECTRONIC SIDE LANE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM 
WHILE THE SOUND QUALITY IS BETTER THAN AVERAGE IT WOULD STILL BENEFIT FROM MORE POWER AND BETTER SPEAKERS AND/OR A SUBWOOFER
WHILE THE VISIBILITY IS NOT THE BEST IN A CHALLENGER THE ADDITION OF THE BACK UP CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM MAKES THE 15 EASIER TO DRIVE THEN MY OTHER CHALLENGERS 
WHILE THERE ARE SOME THINGS CAN COULD BE TWEAKED OR UPDATED THIS SYSTEM IS FAR BETTER THAN ANY OTHER I ENCOUNTERED DURING MY RESEARCH OF COMPETITORS 
WHILE THERE IS A GREAT AND WIDE VARIETY OF STATIONS TO LISTEN TO THERE ARE ONLY 6 SPOTS WERE YOU CAN SAVE THE STATIONS I WISH I COULD SAVE MORE BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD STATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO SAVE BUT I HAVE TO CHANGE STATIONS OFTEN 
WHILE TOP S DOWN REAR VISIBILITY IMPEDED
WHILE TURNING THE DRIVER S VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR AS THE STRUCTURAL MEMBERS SIDE MEMBERS HOLDING WIND SHEILD GOING FROM THE HOOD TO THE ROOF BLOCK THE VIEW TO THE SIDE IT IS WORST DURING THE DARK 
WHILE USING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION AND PASSENGER PLUGS IN THE USB PORT THE SYSTEM WILL TRY AND READ THE USB PORT EVEN AFTER SETTING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION CAN BE PROBLEMATIC 
WHILE USING THE PHONE BOOK TO DIAL A NUMBER YOU CAN T GET TO THE NUMBER IN THE ADDRESS BOOK WITHOUT GOING THRU THE ENTIRE LIST TOGGLEING ONE NAME AT A TIME REDICULOUS 
WHILE VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT THE OTHER INSTALLED PROTECTIONS I E THE FLASHING WARNINGS AND BEEPS COMPENSATE FOR THE POOR VISIBILITY AS FOR THE WIPERS/WASHERS WOLD HAVE PREFERRED NISSAN TO INCLUDE DEFROSTING WIPERS YOU CREATED A VERY NICE 
WHILE VISIBILITY TO THE SIDES AND REAR IS GOOD THE BELT/WINDOW LINE SEEMS HIGHER MAKING IT FEEL LIKE THERE IS LESS VISIBILITY THE BLACK HEADLINER AND DARK ENVIRONMENT IT CREATES WITH THE BLACK PLAID INTERIOR ALSO MAKES IT FEEL LIKE THERE IS LESS 
WHIPLASH REDUCING FRONT SEAT HEADRESTS
WHO KNEW ABOUT THE LED HEADLIGHTS? WOW!!!
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT HAVING HANDS FREE TALKING WOULD BE FUN???? BUT IT IS IN MY CHEVY VOLT! AWESOME FEATURE! EASY TO USE! NO YELLING 
WHOLE CAR I LOVE IT
WHOMEVER DESIGNED THE WINDOWS DID THE BEST JOB OF ANY VEHICLE I HAVE EVER DRIVEN YOU CAN SEE VERY CLEAR AROUND YOU I DON T HAVE THAT BLIND SPOT I HAVE HAD DRIVING OTHER BRANDS 
WHY CAN T YOU SAY FAVORITES AND THEN PICK A DESTINATION FROM YOUR FAVORITES ALL VIA VOICE CONTROL ? THE WORD FAVORITES IS NOT RECOGNIZED 
WHY CANT PANDORA APP AND OTHER APPS BE ON THE VEHICLE WITHOUT USING MY OWN PHONE?
WHY COULDN T THE ENGINEERS DESIGN A WIPER SYSTEM FOR THE FRONT THAT SWEEPS FROM LEFT TO RIGHT THIS WOULD PREVENT THE DEPOSITING OF THE PASSENGER S END OF SWEEP FROM BEING DEPOSITED RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER S LINE OF SIGHT I THINK IT IS MUCH 
WHY COULDN T THERE BE ANOTHER LEVEL OF CLEAR SUN VISOR THAT COULD BE FLIPPED DOWN AND USED 
WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE RAIN SENSORY OF THE WIPERS THAT WOULD COME ON AUTOMATIC WHEN WATER HIT THE WINDSHIELD?
WHY DO PICKUP HOODS STICK UP SO HIGH? MORE STREAMLINE FRONT ENDS WOULD BE BETTER 
WHY DO YOU NEED A CORD TO OPERATE PANDORA? BLUETOOTH WOULD BE MUCH BETTER 
WHY DOES A FORD HAVE A BETTER BLUE TOOTH CONNECTIVITY? THE FACT THAT I BOUGHT A 2015 AUDI WITH AN APPLE 4 CONNECTION? THIS SHOULD BE PUSHING TECHNOLOGY NOT EMBRACING THE OLD WHY NOT HAVE ADAPTERS FOR IPHONE 5? AND WHY IS IT IN THE GLOVE BOX AND N 
WHY DOES IT COST MORE TO GET A BETTER & EASIER TO USE AUDIO SYSTEM
WHY DOES MY IPHONE NOT GIVE ME AUDITORY SIGNALS WHEN BLUETOOTH CONNECTED TO THE VEHICLE? MY HUSBAND S SAMSUNG GIVES AUDITORY SIGNALS WHEN IT RECEIVES ITEMS E G TEXT MESSAGES 
WHY DOES ON STAR AND WIFI HAVE TO BE SO EXPENSIVE?
WHY DOESN T THE BACK UP CAMERA BEEP WHEN THE CAR IS APPROCHING AN OBJECT? IT SEEMS THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN AUDIBLE WARNING 
WHY DON T THE AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS MAKE A SUN VISOR THAT CAN BE A DUAL VISOR ONE THAT CAN BE USED FORWARD AND ONE USED FOR THE SIDE ON BOTH THE DRIVER AND FRONT PASSENGER SEATS 
WHY IS THERE NO TINT ON THE UPPER PORTION OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD? OUR 2005 AND 2010 ACCORD HAVE THE TINT AND IT HELPS WITH THE SUN 
WHY IS THERE NOT A LEFT SIDE MIRROR CAMERA?
WHY MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW???
WHY NO LH BLIND SPOT CAMERA?
WHY NOT BE ABLE TO HEAR THROUGH ALL THE SPEAKERS FOR CALLS OR MEDIA 
WHY ONLY HAVE LANE ASSIST FOR ONE MIRROR AND NOT BOTH?
WHY SUCH A LOMG SURVEY
WHY THIS $75K CAR DOES NOT HAVE LANE DEPARTURE IS BEYOND ME IT IS A CONVERTIBLE AND YOU CAN T SEE OUT THE BACK OR THE SIDE LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS SHOULD HAVE BOTH BACKUP SENSORS AND LANE DEPARTURE IF AS THE DESIGNER SAID IT WAS LEFT OFF BECAUSE H 
WHY TWO SCREENS?????
WHY WE HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE NAVIGATION PROGRAM TO THE PHONE FIRST? AND PAY FOR IT???
WI FI CONNECTION
WI/FI

WIDE VARIETY OF MUSIC SOURCES AVAILABLE I USE THEM ALL
WIDER AND A BIT LONGER SUN VISORS 
WIDER BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY TO OLDER CELL PHONES 
WIDER REAR AND SIDE WINDOWS FOR MORE VISIBILITY 
WIDER SUN VISORS
WIDER SUN VISORS BY WIDER I MEAN THAT COME DOWN FURTHER 
WIDTH
WIDTH OF COLUMNS ARE A HINDERANCE IN VISABILITY
WIDTH OF THE FRONT PILLARS MAKES IT SOMETIMES HARD TO SEE WHEN TURNING 
WIFE 4 11 LADY COMPLAINS THAT A POSTS BLOCK HER VISABILITY ON OCCASION
WIFE 5 2 POOR ADVISABILITY DUE TO DRIVER SIDE MIRROR
WIFE IS SHORT AND HAS A PROBLEM SEEING OVER HER RT SHOULDER WHEN CHANGING LANES BLIND SPOT
WIFE IS SHORT AND LIGHTS COULD BE BETTER TO INDICATE THEY RE ON MAYBE BRIGHTER SHE CAN T TELL WHEN THEY RE ON SOMETIMES 
WIFE LIKED THE TIGUAN BECAUSE OF IT S GREAT VISIBILITY
WIFE SAYS AT NIGHT IN THE RAIN THERE IS A GLARE ON THE FRONT WINDSHIELD THAT MAKES IT HARD TO SEE 
WIFE SAYS REAR VIEW MIRROR ON PASSENGER SIDE BLOCKS HER VIEW 
WIFE TOOK OVER THE JEEP SHE FEELS SAFER DRIVEING IT
WIFE USES COMMUNICATION SYSTEM 
WIFI
WIFI AND INTERNET RADIO ARE THE BEST!
WIFI AND PANDORA RADIO
WIFI NEED TO BE IMPROVE
WILL BE BETTER IF THERE S A CARPLAY WITH IPHONE OR GOOD COMPATIBLE WITH THE BLUETOOTH FUNCTION 
WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE WHEN WE WEAR THIS ONE OUT 
WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER GM
WILL NOT ALLOW MAPS OR GOOGLE MAPS TO PLAY THROUGH BLUETOOTH/CAR SPEAKERS 
WILL NOT I D TRACKS ON CD CONTACTED LINCOLN AND THEY SAID WE ARE WORKING ON IT IN OTHER WORDS GET USE TO IT 
WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR DUE TO POOR VISIBILITY ACCORDING TO TOYOTA ALL 2015 AVALONS ARE LIKE THIS AND THEY DONT HAVE ANY FIX FOR MY CAR THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING!
WILL NOT USE ON STAR FELL THIS SHOULD BE PART OF PACKAGE AND THEY WANT CREDIT CARD SO THEY CAN BILL YOU MOST MANUFACTURES HAVE THIS AVAILABLE WITHOUT BEING BILLED EACH MONTH!!!
WILL TAKE INPUT FROM ANDROID DEVICES BUT NOT NEARLY AS WELL AS IT SHOULD 
WIMPY SOUND OF THE HORN
WIND NOISE
WIND ON ROAD
WIND REALLY BLOWS THE CAR AROUND ON THE ROAD
WIND SCREEN BLOCKS REAR VIEW
WIND SCREEN SHOULD RETRACT FURTHER
WIND SHIELD
WIND SHIELD ON THE CONVERTIBLE BACK SEATS DOES NOT GO ALL THE WAY DOWN MAKING REAR VIEWING A LITTLE DISTRACTING WHEN TOP IS UP
WINDING ROADS CAN CONSTANTLY MOVE THE SUN FROM HEAD ON TO DRIVER SIDE A DOUBLE VISOR WOULD HELP IN TERMS OF VISIBILITY CHECK OUT OUT A TOYOTA 2008 4 RUNNER AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED VISIBILITY WOULD BE BETTER IF THE DRIVER SEAT CAME UP HIGH 
WINDO HEIGHT PREVENTS REACHING ATM PARKING ACCESS
WINDOW BAR ON LEFT INTERFERES WITH VISIBILITY IN LEFT CURVES 
WINDOW CONTROLS SHOULD BE BACK ON CENTER CONSOLE IF RIGHT HAND IS ON STICK IT CAN REACH CONTROLS NOW YOU HAVE TO SWITCH HANDS ON WHEEL TO ROLL DOWN WINDOWS
WINDOW EXPANSE IS LARGE ENOUGH THAT I DON T HAVE A BLIND SPOT
WINDOW HEIGHT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS NEXT TO YOU
WINDOW MUST BE CLOSED SO AS NOT TO DISTORT THE AUDIO WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH

WINDOWS ARE SO DARK VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT 
WINDOWS ARE TINTED PROBABLY WOULD NOT DO AGAIN
WINDOWS ARE TOO HIGH AN DANGEROUSLY OBSCURE DRIVER S VIEW IN ALL DIRECTIONS
WINDOWS ARE TOO SMALL
WINDOWS ARE TOO SMALL FOR VIEWING TRAFFIC

WINDSHIELD DEICEING
WINDSHIELD DOOR POSTS GET IN THE WAY OF VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY DURING RIGHT HAND TURNS LEFT HAND TURNS ARE AT TIMES DIFFICULT DUE TO POST BLOCKING VIEW
WINDSHIELD FOGS UP WITHOUT A/C ON SOME BLIND SPOT DUE TO BAR CONNECTING WINDSHIELD TO FRAME ON DRIVERS SIDE
WINDSHIELD IS PRONE TO GETTING HIT BY ROCKS ON ROAD BROKEN WINDSHIELD IN UNDER 2 MONTHS
WINDSHIELD IS SMALL WHICH PRESENTS A PROBLEM WHEN AT A STOP LIGHT I HAVE TO LEAN FORWARD TO SEE IF ITS GREEN OR RED 
WINDSHIELD IS SMALLER DUR TO SLEEKED DOWN LOOK I LIKED THE LARGER FEEL
WINDSHIELD IS TOO SHORT BECAUSE I AM 6 FOOT ONCE AGAIN NOT ANB ISSUE BECAUSE THE MIATA IS A SPORTS CAR 
WINDSHIELD ON NARROW SIDE HARD TO SEE TRAFFIC SIGNAL OVERHEAD WHEN YOUR CAR IS IN FRONT OF LANE 
WINDSHIELD PILLAR IS TOO THICK/WIDE I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN TURNING BECAUSE THINGS CAN BE HIDDEN BEHIND IT 
WINDSHIELD POST COVERS CARS TO FRONT SIDE AT TIMES
WINDSHIELD POST DRIVERS SIDE CAN T SEE ON COMING TRAFFIC ON CORNER
WINDSHIELD POST ON DRIVER S LEFT SIDE BLOCKS FORWARD VISIBILITY FOR LEFT TURNS 
WINDSHIELD POSTS ARE TO WIDE FOR GOOD VISIABILITY
WINDSHIELD POSTS TO WIDE BLOCKS VIEW
WINDSHIELD PROVIDES A PANORAMIC VIEW AND THE WIPERS MANAGE TO COVER THE VAST AMOUNT OF THE HUGE WINDSHIELD AREA 
WINDSHIELD SEEMS LIKE IT IS HD WAY BETTER THAN OUR PREVIOUS CAR 
WINDSHIELD SHOULD HAVE SHADE STRIP ACROSS THE TOP 
WINDSHIELD SPRAYERS ARE VERY DIRECT HITTING TYPICALLY IN ONE PLACE RATHER THAN A SPRAY THE ISSUE IS THAT AS SOON AS THE SPRAY HITS THE WINDOW THE WIPERS COME ON SMEARING THE DIRTY WINDOW BUT THE SPRAYERS HIT IN ONE PLACE UPPER MIDDLE OF 
WINDSHIELD TO DOOR FRAMING VERY LARGE AND DOES OBSTRUCT VISION
WINDSHIELD WASHER BOTTLE TO SMALL
WINDSHIELD WASHER DISPENSER ARE VERY INEFFECTIVE HONESTLY MY LEAST FAVORITE PART OF THE CAR I VE HAD THEM ADJUSTED ONCE BUT IT DIDNT DO MUCH BETTER WILL BE GOING BACK IN AGAIN 
WINDSHIELD WASHER FRONT SPRAYER IS A BIT ANEMIC THE SPRAY SHOULD REACH FURTHER UP THE WINDSHIELD 
WINDSHIELD WASHER IS POORLY DESIGNED HEADLIGHT WASHERS PROVIDED TOO MUSH PRESSURE SPRAYS ALL OVER THE HOOD AND WINDSHIELD WASHER COMES IN A STREAM NOT SPRAY AND DOESN T ENGAGE UNTIL THE WIPERS HAVE MADE A DRY RUN OVER THE WINDSHIELD 
WINDSHIELD WASHER SHOULD SPRAY MORE ARWA
WINDSHIELD WASHER SPRAYS LOW AND MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE DOES NOT COVER THE ENTIRE WINDHSIELD 
WINDSHIELD WASHERS ARE NOT PROPERLY POSITIONED 
WINDSHIELD WASHERS DO NOT ADEQUATELY SPRAY FLUID ON THE WINDOW NOT PLACED PROPERLY TO CLEAN WINDOW
WINDSHIELD WASHERS NEED TO BE DIRECTED A LITTLE HIGHER ON THE WINDSHIELD
WINDSHIELD WASHERS NOT THOROUGH ON PASSENGER SIDE BETTER DESIGN IS A WIPER ARM SPRAY 
WINDSHIELD WASHERS SET A LITTLE LOW DOESN T REACH UPPER SECTION OF WINDSHIELD AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS 
WINDSHIELD WASHERS TEND TO UNDERSHOOT ON DRIVER S SIDE SO WIPER SMEARS WHATEVER IS THERE WITHOUT CLEANING I SUSPECT THIS CAN BE CORRECTED WHEN I TAKE THE CAR IN FOR SERVICE 
WINDSHIELD WASHING SPRAY DOESN T COVER WINDSHIELD 
WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES POPPED LOOSE AND STOPPED WORKING ON DRIVET SIDE HAD TO TIGHTEN WITH A SOCKET 
WINDSHIELD WIPER IS NOT EFFECTIVE ENOUGH IN CLEARING WATER AS OTHER VEHEICLES I HAVE OPERATED
WINDSHIELD WIPER SETTINGS COULD BE BETTER ALSO USING REAR WIPERS OFTEN TRICKY
WINDSHIELD WIPER SYSTEM A LITTLE TOO COMPLICATED 
WINDSHIELD WIPERS
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE EXCELLENT VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW IMPEDED BY 3RD ROW SEAT HEADRESTS OF COURSE PASSENGERS WOULD DO THE SAME 
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOISY
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY ON THE PASSENGER SIDE
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT OF GOOD QUALITY 
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE TERRIBLE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER UPGRADING I HAD TO CHANGE THEM OUT THE FIRST WEEK I HAD THE TRUCK 
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN!
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE DURING HEAVY RAINS
WINDSHIELD WIPERS COME TO A HALT WHILE STOPPING FOR TRAFFIC SIGNALS WHY?
WINDSHIELD WIPERS COULD WORK BETTER IN THE WINTER THEY FREEZE UP QUITE A BIT AND NEED TO BE CLEAN OF ICE WOULD LIKE A FOG LIGHT OPTION

WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORK WELL AND CLEAR THE CORRECT PARTS OF THE WINDSHIELD 
WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORK WELL IN HEAVY RAINS 
WINDY WEATHER THE CAR IS NOT SAFE AT ALL! NORMAL WEATHERS CANT DRIVE OVER 60MPH THE VEICLE IS NIT SAFE ITS NOT STABLE 
WING BLOCKS BUT WHAT YA GONNA DO?
WING COMPROMISES REAR VISIBILITY SHOULD HAVE STANDARD REAR VIEW CAMERA 
WING MIRRORS ARE VERY POOR THEY PROVIDE A VERY NARROW FIELD OF VISION 
WINTER PACKAGE
WIPER ARE DEEP UNDER HOOD SNOW AND ICE FREEZE HARD TO CLEAN
WIPER ARE POOR QUALITY
WIPER BLADE DESIGN IS SUCH THAT WHEN USING WASHER FLUID WHILE DRIVING ABOVE 25 MPH THE BLADE RETAINS THE FLUID AND CONTINUES TO SPLATTER ON WINDSHIELD FORCING CONTINUOUS USE OF THE WIPERS TO CLEAR IT OFF 
WIPER BLADES COULD BE BOSCH WOULD BE BETTER
WIPER BLADES COULD BE IMPROVED
WIPER BLADES DON T SEEM TO HUG THE WINDSHIELD AS THEY SHOULD
WIPER BLADES ON CARE WERE NOT THAT GREAT
WIPER BLADES SEEM VERY CHEAP FOR THIS LEVEL OF VEHICLE
WIPER BLADES SWEEP THE WINDSHIELD THERE IS A GAP THAT IS NOT WIPED AWAY ON THE BOTTOM OF PASSENGER SIDE POOR DESIGN WITH NO FIX AS PER THE DEALER 
WIPER CONTROLS ARE CONFUSING
WIPER CONTROLS ARE LACKING
WIPER CONTROLS ARE STRANGE
WIPER CONTROLS CAN BE CONFUSING WITH 3 DIFFERENT CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL COLUMN
WIPER CONTROLS SEEM TO BE IN A WEIRD PLACE HAVING A HARD TIME LEARNING HOW TO USE WIPERS

WIPER DO NOT CLEAN THE WHOLE FRONT WINDOW 
WIPER DRIVER SIDE MAKES A NOISE WHEN RUNNING AT TIMES NOT ALL THE TIME 
WIPER FLUID / WIPERS DON T SEEM TO GO THEIR JOB

WIPER SYSTEM POORLY DESIGNED DRIVER SIDE LONG BLADE PASS SIDE SHORT BLADE YOU ALWAYS HAVE ONE SIDE WITH POOR VISION THE DRIVER S BLADE CAME OFF THE FIRST RAINING DAY 
WIPER VISABILTY IS A PROBLEM WHEN IT SNOWS OTHER TIMES IT IS AVERAGE 
WIPERS
WIPERS & WATER JETS DON T SEEM UP TO THE TASK WIPER ARMS DO NOT CLEAR HOOD IF YOU WANT TO LIFT THEM TO BE CLEANED OR CHANGED OR LEFT UP LIKE WE DO IN SNOW STORMS WHILE PARKED I DOUBT THE DEFROST SYSTEM CAN KEEP UP WITH SNOW AND ICE ACCUMULATI

WIPERS ARE NOT SOLID SEEM CHINSY
WIPERS ARE NOT THAT GOOD FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR THE CAR WE BOUGHT CONTOR WIPERS 33 00 THESE I WOULD RECOMMEND STANDARD ISSUE 
WIPERS ARE NOT VERY EFFECTIVE AND I HAVE ONLY USED THEM A COUPLE OF TIMES SO FAR
WIPERS ARE NOT VERY EFFECTIVE OF CLEANING OFF EXCESSIVE BUG DEBRIS BUT DO A GOOD JOB OF KEEPING WINDSHIELD CLEAR OF RAIN HEADLIGHTS FEEL A LITTLE DIM BUT THEY ARE AIMED EFFECTIVELY AND DO PROVIDE ADEQUATE LIGHTING

WIPERS BROKE DURING USE
WIPERS COULD BE BETTER
WIPERS COULD BE BETTER 
WIPERS COULD BE BETTER TRUNK IS A BIT TOO HIGH SHOULD HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED STANDARD WITH A BACK UP CAMERA 
WIPERS COULD BE MADE LESS COMPLICATED

WIPERS DO NOT COVER RIGHT CORNER OF FRONT WINDOW 
WIPERS DO NOT COVER THE ENTIRE FRONT WINDOW WHEN USED
WIPERS DO NOT EFFECTIVELY CLEAN WINDSHIELD IN WINTER
WIPERS DO NOT EFFECTIVELY CLEAR WASHER FLUID AT NORMAL DRIVING SPEED ANY FLUID MOVED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDSHIELD MOVES BACK UP THE WINDSHIELD AFTER WIPERS STOP 
WIPERS DO NOT WORK THE GREATEST
WIPERS DOESN T SEEM TO DO A GOOD JOB DOESN T CLEAR ENOUGH OF THE WINDOW LEAVES STREAKS WASHER FLUILD SPRAY DOESN T GET ENOUGH TO CLEAN PROPERLY
WIPERS DON T ALWAYS CLEAR THE WINDSHIELD ENTIRELY ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT LOVE THE REAR CAMERA AND LANE CHANGE WARNINGS IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS

WIPERS DON T SEEM EFFECTIVE AS DESIGNED 
WIPERS DON T SIT BELOW THE WINDOW LEVEL ALSO THEY DO NOT COVER THE ENTIRE WINDSHIELD THEY LEAVE A SMALL SPOT ON THE BOTTOM PASSENGER SIDE THAT DOESN T GET WIPED 
WIPERS DON T WASH WELL TOWARD TOP OF WINDOW VISIBILITY LIMIT CAUSES A LOT OF STREAKING
WIPERS DON T WIPE VERY WELL
WIPERS DON T WORK THAT GREAT WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING THE WATER ALMOST SHOOTS OVER THE WINDOW LIKE ITS JET POWERED 
WIPERS FREEZE EASILY WITH BIG ICE CHUNKS LEAVING THE WINDOW UNSAFE TO SEE THROUGH AT TIMES THIS MAY NOT BE A BIG DEAL BUT WE ARE EXPERIENCING A BAD COLD WINTER THIS YEAR SO THIS IS MORE NOTICEABLE 
WIPERS FREEZE UP IN ICY CONDITIONS DEFROSTERS DO NOT CLEAR ICE FROM BLADES 
WIPERS FRONT OR REAR DON T WORK WELL IN 20 DEG C OR BELOW TEMPS 
WIPERS GET CLOGGED WITH SNOW EASILY DURING SNOWSTORMS LESS COSTLY CARS HAVE HEATED WINDSHIELDS TO HELP THIS PROBLEM 
WIPERS GET GUMMED UP WITH SNOW AND REMAIN FROZEN NEED TO REACH OUT AND SNAP THEM AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD TO FREE THEM UP IF WIPER DIDN T LOWER SO FAR DOWN BENEATH THE WINDSHIELD THE DEFROSTERS MAY KEEP THEM FREED UP
WIPERS GOING ON BY THEMSELVES
WIPERS HAVE BEEN POOR SINCE WE PICKED UP THE VEHICLE BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGE WHEN CHANGING LANES 
WIPERS ICE OVER IN THE WINTER
WIPERS ICE UP DRIVING IN SNOW

WIPERS ICE UP WINDOW
WIPERS IN FRONT ARE GREAT
WIPERS LEAVE BIT OF STREAK
WIPERS LEAVE STREAKS
WIPERS MOVE IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WHICH IS A LITTLE DISTRACTING BUT I CAN DEAL WITH IT 
WIPERS NEED MORE INTERVAL OPTIONS FRONT AND REAR SENSORS NEED MORE DISTANCE FOR OBJECT DETECTION TURN SIGNAL INDICATORS SHOULD BE VISIBLE FROM FRONT AND REAR OF VEHICLE ON THE EXTERNAL MIRRORS 
WIPERS NEED MORE STEPS OR CHOICES NOT 2 
WIPERS NEED TO BE BETTER QUALITY FOR A CLEAN SWIPE
WIPERS NOT DESIGNED WELL THEY FLOW FROM PASSENGER SIDE TO DRIVER SIDE IN HEAVY WET SNOW IT BUILT UP A LAYER OF SNOW AT THE EDGE OF THE WINDSHIELD ON THE DRIVER SIDE 
WIPERS PARK TOO LOW ON THE WINDSHIELD IN SNOW AND FREEZING CONDITIONS THEY GET ICED UP TOO FAST BECAUSE THE HEAT DOESN T REACH THEM 
WIPERS PERFORM VERY POORLY IN SNOW ACCUMULATE SNOW AND ICE
WIPERS REQUIRE A GREAT DEAL OF WASHER FLUID USE TO WORK AT THEIR BEST AT TIMES 
WIPERS SEEM TO NOT HAVE A LOW SETTING THAT IS LOW ENOUGH I VE PUT THE WIPERS IN THE VARIABLE MODE AND THEY STILL SEEM TO WIPE TOO OFTEN AT TIMES
WIPERS SEEM TOO TIGHT AND TOO SQUEAKY FOR A BRAND NEW CAR 
WIPERS SHOULD BE RAIN SENSING
WIPERS SKIP AT SLOW SPEED
WIPERS SMEAR TO OFTEN
WIPERS STILL FREEZE EVEN WITH THE WIPER HEATERS
WIPERS STOPPED OPERATING DURING RAIN STORM /THE CAUSE WAS A BOLT FALLING OFF OF LINKAGE THE USE OF A LOCK WASHER OR AT THE VERY LEAST SOME LOCKTITE COMPOUND WOULD PREVENT THIS PROBLEM
WIPERS STUTTER SLIGHTLY IN SLIGHT RAIN CONDITIONS 
WIPERS TEND TO BE NOISY
WIPERS TEND TO ICE EASILY AND THEN DON T WORK WELL REAR WIPER IS TOO SMALL ONLY CLEANS THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDOW THE WASHER SPRAYERS ARE GREAT THOUGH AS THEY FAN OUT INSTEAD OF STREAMS I PUT AVERAGE FOR THE VISORS BUT I AM SHORT SO NO CAR HAS G 
WIPERS TEND TO ICE UP AND ARE NOT EFFECTIVE
WIPERS TEND TO STREAK 
WIPERS THAT CAME ON THE VEHICLE STREAK ALREADY AND I HAVE ONLY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR 2 MONTHS FOR THE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE THEY COULD PUT HIGHER QUALITY WIPERS ON

WISHED THEY HAD SMALL SPOT MIRROR ON SIDE MIRRORS
WISHED VISORS WERE LARGER AND DUAL
WITH A BACK WIND SHIELD THAT IS AS FLAT AS THE FRS S IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A BACK WINDSHIELD WIPER THAT S JUST MY OPINION OTHERS MAY NOT AGREE 
WITH A CAR OF THIS SIZE AND IN THIS CLASS IT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT MONITORING 
WITH A NEW LAW PASSED REGARDING NOT USING PHONES WHILE DRIVING THIS HANDS FREE DEVICE IS A LIFE SAFER! MY DAUGHTER IS ABLE TO MAKE CRUCIAL CALLS WHEN NEEDED WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING HER SAFETY AS WELL AS OTHER DRIVERS 
WITH A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING TO THE RIGHT 
WITH A QUALITY VEHICLES AS THIS IT SHOULD HAVE HAD AN OPTION FOR HID HEADLIGHTS OR BE A STANDARD ACCESSORY PROJECTOR BEAM IS A GOOD START BUT HID S TO MATCH THE LED ACCENT LIGHTS WITH THE LED ACCENT LIGHTS AS DRL WOULD HAVE MADE THIS A HOME RUN 
WITH A SMALL REAR WINDOW THEY SHOULD MAKE A REAR VIEW CAMERA STANDARD ON ALL OF THEIR VEHICLES ALSO THE MIRROR SHOULD COME WITH BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ADDED IN 
WITH A SOMEWHAT QUICK PULL OF WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID SPRAY THE WIPERS DO NOT FOLLOW WITH A WIPE IF YOU PULL FOR WHAT I THINK TO BE A MUCH LONGER THAN NEEDED PULL THE WIPERS WILL WIPE JUST ONCE I ALWAYS NEED TO MANUALLY ENGAGE THE WIPERS AFTER 
WITH ALL OF THE REAR HEADRESTS LOOKING AT THE BACK WINDOW IS FUTILE 
WITH ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURE THIS VEHICLE HAS THERE S ABSOLUTELY NO BLIND SPOTS 
WITH ALL OF THE WINDOWS AND HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE IT IS VERY EASY TO SEE AROUND YOU THE ONLY CONCERN WOULD BE LOW IN THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE 
WITH ALL THE ADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES YOU DO FEEL VERY SAFE WHEN DRIVING ESPECIALLY THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE
WITH ALL THE HIGH TECH GADGETS INCLUDED HOW COULD HONDA NOT PROVIDE AN AN AUDIBLE WARNING SYSTEM WHEN VEHICLE IS IN REVERSE GEAR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA DOES NOT PROVIDE AN ACCURATE INDICATION OF PROXIMITY TO WALL OR OTHER OBSTRUCTION A ELECTRONIC 
WITH ALL THE SAFTY FEATURES THE SOLID SMOOTH RIDE AND GOOD VISABLITY I FIND IT TO BE A VERY SAFE FEELING RIDE 
WITH ALL THE SENSORS ON THIS CAR IT SHOULD BEEP AND WARN YOU WHEN BACKING UP 
WITH BEATS SPEAKERS I EXPECTED IT TO BE LOUDER BUT IT IS STILL A VERY CRISP CLEAR SOUND LOVE ALL THE MUSIC OPTIONS AM FM XM SD CARD USB BLUETOOTH 
WITH BEING SHORT THE SUN VISOR IS A LITTLE TOO SHORT IT NEEDS TO BE AN INCH LONGER SUN IS IN MY EYES 
WITH BOTH HEAD RESTS UP 2ND ROW SEATS VISION FROM REAR VIEW MIRROR IS DECREASED WHEN TRYING TO SEE OUT BACK WINDOW IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOWER THEM OUT OF THE WAY OR REMOVE THEM WHEN THESE SEATS ARE NOT BEING USED 
WITH CONVERTIBLE TOP UP REAR SIDE VIEW AND BACK VIEW SOME TIMES DIFFICULT TOP DOWN VIEW IS GREAT 
WITH CREW CAB HARD TO SEE DUE TO NEEDED SUPPORT FOR FRONT AND REAR DRIVER S SIDE DOORS
WITH FOUR 4 SPOUTS FOR WASHER FLUID YOU CAN GO THRU A LOT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME 
WITH HEAD RESTS UP ON 3RD ROW SEATS IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE THRU THE REAR WINDOW
WITH HEADLIGHTS IN THE LOW POSITION THERE IS A DEFINITE HORIZONTAL LINE BETWEEN WHAT IS VISIBLE AND WHAT ISN T BELOW THE LINE IS VISIBLE/ILLUMINATED ABOVE THE LINE IS TOTALLY DARK INSTEAD OF GRADUALLY DIMMING WITH DISTANCE HIGH BEAMS ARE GREAT 
WITH HOW CHOPPED THE NEW MUSTANG IS IT BLOWS THE DOORS OFF OTHER AMERICAN MUSCLE CARS WHEN IT COMES TO VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFELY BEST IN CLASS IN MY OPINION 
WITH IT BEING A HATCHBACK AND THE WAY THE WINDOWS ARE SMALL IN THE BACK IT MAKES IT HARD TO SEE HOWEVER THERE IS A BACKUP CAMERA AND I HAVE NO PROBLEMS IF THERE WAS NO CAMERA IT WOULD BE A BIG PROBLEM SEEING OUT THE BACK 
WITH JUST MINIMAL TIME SPENT LEARNING THE SYSTEMS THEY FUNCTION BEYOND EXPECTATION 
WITH KEYLESS START NEED TO HAVE TOUCH UNLOCK OF DOORS
WITH NEW I DRIVE SYSTEM IT IS SO EASY TO NAVIGATE FROM MEDIA TO RADIO AND SAT RADIO WHILE STILL PAYING ATTENTION ON ROAD 
WITH NO TOUCH SCREEN IT IS SLOW TO ENTER ADDRESS INFORMATION ETC FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO TURN THE KNOB TO EACH LETTER AND PUSH THE KNOB TO ENTER IT TEST DRIVING AND LOOKING AT THE CAR I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TOUCH SCREEN ALSO FOR 
WITH ONE OF OUR CELL PHONES WE APPRECIATE THE BLUETOOTH COMMUNICATION SYSTEM 
WITH OURS THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT WHEN TURNING RIGHT OR LEFT SINCE WE HAVE THE BIG MIRRORS FOR TOWING 
WITH PASSENGER PRESENT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENTER POINT OF DESTINATION ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YOU SHOULDN T HAVE TO BE PARKED WHEN YOU HAVE A PASSENGER WHO IS ABLE TO ENTER THE INFORMATION 
WITH REAR CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT WARNING IT ADDS A LOT OF SAFETY
WITH REGARDS TO GMC CANYON S VISIBILITY AND SAFETY OF CONTROLS I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THE 4WD SELECTOR KNOB I SENT AND EMAIL GMC CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH NO RESPONSE THE KNOB ITSELF FUNCTIONS BEAUTIFULLY HOWEVER IT IS A BAD LOCATION TO THE LEF 
WITH REGARDS TO THE CHILD VIEW MIRROR WHILE AN EXCELLENT IDEA THE MIRROR ITSELF IS DISTORTED AND DIFFICULT TO SEE CLEARLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE BACK SEAT ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF VEHICLE SAFETY I AM PLEASED WITH OVERALL AS A MOTHER OF 2 ELE 
WITH ROOF UP I REALLY CAN T SEE TO BACK OUT 
WITH SOMEONE IN FRONT PASSENGER SEAT IT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE TO THE RIGHT WHEN LOOKING FOR TRAFFIC OR PEOPLE COMING FROM THAT DIRECTION
WITH THE 3RD ROW SEATS UP IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW 
WITH THE ADDITION SAFETY PACKAGE LANE CHANGE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR WORKS GREAT COLLISION ALERT SOMETIMES GOES OFF WITH NO TRAFFIC 
WITH THE BACK SEAT HEAD REST IT LIMITS YOUR VIEW FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND THE SIDE MIRRORS WOULD VE BEEN A LOT BETTER IF THEY WERE HEATED 
WITH THE BACKUP CAMERA VISIBILITY IS GREAT 
WITH THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM I DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE A PORTABLE ONE THAT BLOCKS MY VISION WHEN MOUNTED ON THE WINDOW
WITH THE CONVERTIBLE TOP THERE IS SOME LOSS OF REAR VISIBILITY BUT THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A CONVERTIBLE 
WITH THE CONVERTIBLE TOP UP REAR LOOKING SIDE VIEWS ARE NOT GREAT
WITH THE CONVERTIBLE TOP UP REAR VISIBILITY IS LOW AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY BLIND SPOTS HOWEVER IT IS TO BE EXPECTED 
WITH THE CONVERTIBLE TOP UP THERE ARE A LOT OF BLINDSPOTS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES 
WITH THE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS TO ACCESS MUSIC/SPORTS/MEDIA I LIKE THE OVERALL USEFULNESS OF THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF ACCESSIBILITY THE HONDA PROVIDES 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ISSUES I MENTIONED BEFORE THE SYSTEM IS GREAT I FEEL THAT I SHOULD SAY THAT THE TIMES I HAVE USED THESE EXTRAS IS EVERY TIME I HAVE DRIVEN THE CAR I DON T USE THIS CAR EVERY DAY 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE VERY SMALL SIZE OF THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY AND SAFETY ARE SOME OF THE BEST I VE SEEN IN AN SUV 
WITH THE FRONT ANGLE IT S HARD TO JUDGE WHERE THE FRONT OF THE CAR IS PARKING 
WITH THE HEAD REST EXTENDED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD ROW SEATS IT MAKES VIEWING OUT THE BACK A LITTLE MORE OBSTRUCTED 
WITH THE HEADLIGHTS AND DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS I CAN SEE THE ENTIRE ROAD WHICH IS AWESOME!
WITH THE HIGH HEADREST IT IS HARD TO VIEW OUTSIDE REAR ACTIONS DRIVERS VIEW OF THE FRONTEND IT IS HARD TO DETERMINE HOW CLOSE YOU MAY COME TO AN OBJECT 
WITH THE HIGHER PROFILES OF TRUNK LIDS TODAY ONE CAN NO LONGER SEE THE END OF THE CAR AND MUST RELY ON THE BACK UP CAMERA SYSTEM 
WITH THE LARGE MIRRORS IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES TO YOUR RIGHT OR LEFT AT INTERSECTIONS 
WITH THE LARGE WING BLOCKING REAR VISIBILITY A BACK UP OR REAR VISION CAMERA OPTION SHOULD BE OFFERED ON THIS MODEL
WITH THE LOWER RATING OF REAR VISION THE HEADREST OF THE BACK MIDDLE SEAT DOES HINDER VISIBILITY MORE THAN IF IT WEREN T THERE OF COURSE LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA LIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL 
WITH THE NAVIGATION AND THE PHONE THE SYSTEM HAVE PROBLEMS GETTING MY REQUEST CORRECT SOMETIMES THE PHONE GET NAME REQUEST WRONG SOMETIMES AND WILL NOT DISCONNECT IN THE DESIRED AMOUNT OF TIME THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOMETIMES GO OUT OF THE WAY T 
WITH THE NAVIGATION IT INDICATES UPCOMING EVENTS I E DISABLED VEHICLE AHEAD WITH THE COMMUNICATION I CAN SPEAK COMMANDS I E CALL HUSBAND 
WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT WAS CUMBERSOME TO ENTER INFORMATION AND WHEN KEYING IN POINTS OF INTERESTS THAT ARE VERY ESTABLISHED IT WOULD NOT GENERATE ANY USEFUL RESULTS 
WITH THE OPTIONAL CAMERA SYSTEM THAT IS INCLUDED WITH MY CAR REAR AND PARKING VISIBILITY ARE EXCELLENT 
WITH THE REAR WING THIS CAR NEEDS A BACK UP CAMERA
WITH THE ROAD NOISE THAT YOU HEAR IT S DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE RADIO OR TALK HANDS FREE UNLESS EVERYTHING IS TURNED UP THERE IS NO WAY TO TALK WITH THE SUNROOF OPEN 
WITH THE SEAT UP THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH ADJUSTMENT
WITH THE SPLIT MIRRORS THE MIRRORS CAN NOT BE PROPERLY ADJUSTED 
WITH THE STANDARD TELESCOPING STEERING WHEEL AND ABILITY TO RAISE THE DRIVERS SEAT UP IT S A JOY TO DRIVE THIS VEHICLE 
WITH THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE ON MY GENESIS I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE 
WITH THE THIRD ROW SEATS NOW HIGHER IT OBSTRUCTS THE REAR VIEW 
WITH THE TOP DOWN ALL VISABILITY ISSUES ARE GONE 
WITH THE TOP DOWN IT S 360 DEGREES TOP UP IT S AVERAGE VISIBILITY 
WITH THE TOP DOWN VISIBILITY IMPROVES TOP UP FORCES YOU TO BE A BETTER DRIVER SOMETHING THAT IS MISSING IN THE WAY MANY DRIVE TODAY 
WITH THE TOP UP IT IS HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES IN EITHER DIRECTION THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE MARGINAL AND THE CLOSED TOP RESULTS IN A BLIND SPOT TO THE BACK RIGHT FOR THE DRIVER 
WITH THE TOP UP IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE BEHIND THE VEHICLE 
WITH THE TOP UP REAR VISIBILITY IS A REAL PROBLEM ONE MUST CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK SIDE MIRRORS WHEN ENTERING TRAFFIC OR TURNING AT INTERSECTIONS A BLIND SPOT ASSIST OPTION WOULD HELP SO THAT A BLINKING LIGHT WOULD GO OFF IN THE MIRRORS IF SOMEO 
WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN IT IS SO EASY TO USE AND IT HAS SO MUCH VARIETY AND OPTIONS IT IS TRULY ONE OF THE EASIEST AND COOLEST SYSTEMS I VE EVER HAD IN A VEHICLE
WITH THE TOW MIRRORS THE RIGHT MIRROR HAS A BLIND SPOT WHERE A STANDARD SIZE VEHICLE CAN NOT BE SEEN
WITH THE VIDEO SCREENS DOWN AND THE 3RD ROW HEADRESTS UP VIEW OUT THE BACK IS LIMITED OTHERWISE I A SHORT PERSON SEE BETTER IN MY SUBURBAN THAN IN OUR SEDAN 
WITH THE VISORS SOMETIMES THEY HAD EXTENSIONS ON THE VISOR TO BLOCK OUT THE BLIND SPOT FROM THE SUN
WITH THIS SYSTEM IT TAKES FOREVER TO TYPE AN ADDRESS AND FOR THAT YOU FIRST NEED TO FIND THE ADDRESS OF THE STORE HOSPITAL DRY CLEANER ETC IN YOUR PHONE THEN TYPE THAT ADDRESS IN A VERY AWKWARD WAY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SIMPLY TEXT TO THE CAR 
WITH THREE HEADRESTS INSTALLED IN THE BACK SEATS IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE TRAFFIC VIA THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AS A RESULT I REMOVED THE MIDDLE HEADREST AND STORED IT IN THE TRUNK WITH SIDE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS INSTALLED AND THE REAR ROOF LINE 
WITH UNDER 3000 MILES I HAVE NOT HAD EXTENSIVE USE OF THE SUBJECT SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES 
WITH WINDOW AIR DEFLECTORS INSTALLED THERE IS MUCH LARGER BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVER S SEAT WHEN MAKING TURNS 
WITHOUT A DOUBT THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM I HAVE A 2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER WHO USED TO GET ANXIOUS TO DO STUFF AND GET OUT OF THE OLD 2011 RR SPORT WHICH DID NOT HAVE THE SCREENS THE NEW 2015 SPORT HAS THIS FEATURE AND IT IS LIKE SHE IS IN A CIN 
WITHOUT A PAPER MANUAL IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO LEARN THIS COMPLICATED SYSTEM MY LAST XC70 WAS A 2011 WITHOUT THE MANUAL I SIMPLY HAVE NOT TAKEN THE TIME TO LEARN ALL THINGS AVAILABLE TO ME I ALSO DO NOT LIKE WHEN I AM SEARCHING TO HAVE TO 
WITHOUT A REARVIEW CAMERA IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BACKUP IN PARKING SPACES ACCURATELY AND SAFELY 
WITHOUT A TOUCH SCREEN USING THE KNOW TO TYPE IN AN ADDRESS IS TERRIBLE MUST HAVE TOUCH SCREEN 
WITHOUT AN OWNERS MANUAL IT TAKES SOME TIME TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEM I WILL ACCEPT THAT PART OF IT IS MY FAULT BUT I ABSOLUTELY HATE THAT I NEED TO STOP AND LOOK UP AN ISSUE OR PROBLEM ON MY PHONE WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS WHICH I COULD 
WITHOUT BLIND SIDE ASSISTANCE IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE LANES 
WITHOUT BLIND SPOT ELECTRONIC ASSIST FROM THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS IT WOULD BE AVERAGE AT BEST TO CHECK FOR CARS IN OTHER LANES BEFORE SWITCHING LANES OR TURNING
WITHOUT CAMERA AND MARKING IN DISPLAY TO ASSIST BACK UP AND PARKING WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT 
WITHOUT HAVING THE IPOD INTEGRATION PLAYING MUSIC FROM AN IPOD IS NOT EASY TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING SINCE IT HAS TO BE DONE THROUGH THE IPOD 
WITHOUT LANE DEVIATION AND SIDE SENSORS THIS VEHICLE NEED S MORE GLASS 
WITHOUT NAVIGATION PANE IT IS CUMBERSOME
WITHOUT POWER SEAT CONTROLS TO RAISE THE SEAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE IN FRONT WHEN PARKING 
WITHOUT REAR CAMERA IT WOULD BE HARD TO SEE WHILE BACKING UP 
WITHOUT REAR CAMERA PHYSICAL VISIBILITY WOULD NOT BE ADEQUATE
WITHOUT THE BACKUP CAMERA AND WARNING OF PASSING CAR BACKING UP IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT DUE TO REAR CORNER POST AND FRONT SEATS USE BOTH CAMERA WARNINGS AND THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS 
WITHOUT THE BACKUP CAMERA REAR VISIBILITY WOULD BE A REAL CONCERN 
WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION FEATURE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEARLY SEE VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT 
WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR I FEEL THIS VEHICLE WOULD BE UNSAFE BUT LUCKILY I HAVE THAT
WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM THERE WOULD BE VERY BAD BLIND SPOT ISSUES 
WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM THE VISIBILITY WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC 
WITHOUT THE CAMERAS I COULD NOT SEE OUT AND AROUND THE CAR FOR OTHER VEHICLES FRONT OF CAR TAKES GETTING USE TO BECAUSE IT SLOPES BUT AFTER YOU GET USE TO IT YOU DON T NOTICE IT 
WITHOUT THE MIRROR INDICATORS OF CARS IN MY BLIND SPOT S I WONDER IF I MAY NOT HAVE HIT SOME CARS!
WITHOUT THE ONSTAR SYSTEM I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THE CAR
WITHOUT THE REAR CAMERA AND AS SMALL AS THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BACK UP RESPONSIBLY WITHOUT A SPOTTER 
WITHOUT THE REAR CAMERA I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE 
WOBBLY WHEN WINDY
