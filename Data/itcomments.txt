I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A STANDARD PLUG AVAILABLE THAT WE COULD USE TO PLUG IN MISCELLANEOUS IPAD IPHONE TABLETS ETC
TO ACTUALLY HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUILT IN
THE NISSAN CONNECT APPS DO NOT WORK WELL AND THERE ARE VERY FEW OF THEM IT S ALMOST A POINTLESS FEATURE
THE VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT ALMOST SEEMS LIKE IT WOULD BE A STANDARD ITEM
BEING ABLE TO TAKE THE BASS OUT OF THE DOOR SPEAKERS SINCE HAVING BASS GOING THROUGH THEM IS NOT GOOD FOR THE SPEAKER AND ALSO ADDS DISTORTION TO OVERALL SOUND QUALITY MY TRUCK HAS A SUBWOOFER BUT I HAVE NO OPTION TO TURN THE SUBWOOFER UP DOWN
WHEN I BOUGHT THIS TRUCK ALL I WANTED WAS A BASIC RADIO AND MAYBE 1 CD PLAYER I DID NOT WANT NOR NEED ALL OF THE BLUETOOTH STUFF JUST WANT TO HEAR A LITTLE MUSIC I REALLY HATED PAYING FOR ALL OF THAT EXTRA COMPUTER STUFF WHEN ALL I NEEDED
I TRULY DON T KNOW I LISTEN TO THE RADIO BUT DON T USE A CELL PHONE OR ANY ELECTRONIC GIZMOS WHILE IN THE CAR
THE SOUND QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED
VOICE RECOGNITION WORKS VERY WELL
CAR APP COULD WORK MORE EASILY SOMETIMES LOADS AND SOMETIMES WILL NOT GOOGLE APP WILL NOT WORK
BETTER APPS TO CONNECT WITH CAR PANDORA IS THE ONLY USEFUL APP NISSAN APP CAN OFFER ME
WHEN USING USING COMMUNICATION SYSTEM FOR PHONE CALLS THE PEOPLE I M SPEAKING TO OFTEN HAVE TROUBLE HEARING ME CLEARLY
NAVIGATION ADDRESS ENTRY VIA SPOKEN COMMANDS ADDRESS IS NEVER CORRECT
USB PORT STANDARD ON ALL MODELS ESPECIALLY ONE PLACED IN THE CONSOLE IMPROVING THE RADIO DISPLAY AND PHONE SOUND QUALITY
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FRUSTRATES ME AS I HAVEN T FIGURED OUT YET HOW TO GET AN OVERVIEW OF THE ROUTE AND HOW TO CHANGE IT TO A ROUTE I WANT TO TAKE I AM SURE I JUST NEED TO USE IT MORE TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH IT I FIND I HAVE TO USE MY PHONES NA
IT HAS A GOOD AUDIO SYSTEM WITH POOR SPEAKER THE SOUND IS NOT APPRECIATED AS IT SHOULD BE I AM THINKING ON REPLACING THEM ESPECIALLY THE BACK SPEAKERS ALMOST NO SOUND IS COMING OUT OF THEM
TOO MANY COMMANDS TO FOLLOW WHILE TRYING TO MAKE A PHONE CALL I WANT TO JUST PUSH THE BUTTON AND ASK IT TO CALL A NAME WITHOUT GOING THROUGH SAYING PHONE AND THEN CALL NAME AND THEN HAVING TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN TO TELL THE NUMBER IF THERE ARE MU
WOULD HAVE GIVEN A 10 BUT I WANTED A LITTLE MORE OF A WOW FACTOR WITH THE LOOK OF THE AUDIO AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM
SOUND QUALITY AND FEEL OF CONTROLS
APPEARANCE AND VOICE RECOGNITION
IT HAS THE BLUETOOTH LOGO ABOVE THE RADIO BUT HOW TO GET THE BLUETOOTH TO WORK IS NOT APPARENTLY OBVIOUS LIKE IN THE LEAF SL WHICH I LEASED PREVIOUSLY IN FACT AFTER WORKING THE MENU CONTROL ON THE CENTER CONSOLE FOR A WHILE I THINK IT MAY
MY JUKE COULD ACCESS MY IPOD REALLY FAST AND WAS SIMPLE TO USE THIS IS REALLY SLOW TO RECOGNIZE MY IPOD THEN IT HAS TO BUILD AN INDEX OF THE CONTENTS THEN IT S SLOW TO SCROLL THE CONTENTS THEN IT STARTS PLAYING THE AUDIO 5 10 SECOND
WHEN LISTENING TO MY IPHONE I HAVE TO ADJUST VOLUME WAY UP THERE S A BIG DIFFERENCE ON THE VOLUME BETWEEN PHONE AND RADIO
PLACE THE USB PORT UNCOVERED ON THE DASHBOARD NEAR THE RADIO SO IT CAN BE SEEN AND USED EASILY
SCREEN IS REALLY JUST A BIT TOO SMALL FOR EASE OF USE AND GLANCING AT MAP WHILST DRIVING
VOICE COMMANDS TAKE TOO MANY STEPS TO EXECUTE THAN I WOULD LIKE ENTERING DESTINATIONS FOR MAP FUNCTION TAKES MORE STEPS THAN I WOULD LIKE MAKE IT MORE LIKE SIRI
IPHONE PODCAST CONTROL APP INTEGRATION COULD BE BETTER
BLUETOOTH ATTACHMENT SHOULD COME STANDARD WITH STEERING WHEEL ACCESS TO SIRI ON IPHONES ALSO IF PLUGGED INTO USB YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS SIRI OR OTHER VOICE COMMANDS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL RATHER THAN USING THE ACTUAL PHONE CONTROLS THE
MAKE SIRIUS OPTIONAL THE BUG YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE TO RENEW
THE SPEAKERS ARE PRETTY QUIET PHONE CALLS ARE FINE BUT THE RADIO SEEMS MUFFLED
MY CAR DOESN T PLAY ANY MUSIC ON MY IPHONE THAT IS EMAILED TO ME AS A FILE ATTACHMENT MY OLD LEAF WOULD PLAY THOSE FILES WITHOUT ISSUE
RADIO XM SELECTION AND PROGRAMMING IMPROVED
DISPLAY FOR NAVIGATION IS TOO SMALL
IN GENERAL THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SYSTEMS ARE BETTER THAN EXPECTED NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN METHODS TO NAME AND RECALL ROUTES AND WOULD PREFER MAPS SIMILAR TO GOOGLE S DISPLAYS
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED
THE FLAP THAT COVERS THE USB PORT NEEDS TO BE HELD OPEN WHILE INSERTING USB PLUG OR DEVICE BECAUSE IT IS SPRING LOADED AND CLOSES WHEN YOU LET GO OF IT PLEASE FIX IT SO IT CAN BE OPENED AND STAY OPEN THIS WILL MAKE PLUGGING ITEMS INTO THE USB
THE AUDIO MENUS ARE HARD TO FIND AND DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE WHEN 2 PAIRED PHONES ARE IN RANGE THE CAR SHOULD ASK WHICH ONE TO USE SINCE THE CAR HAS A LIMITED RANGE I RARELY NEED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT S IMPORTANT TO HAVE BUT MORE ATTENTI
TOUCH SCREEN SHOULD BE STANDARD IN ALL LEAF S
MUSIC STREAMING THRU BLUETOOTH
NAVIGATION COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
POOR SPEAKER SOUND QUALITY
BLUETOOTH SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE CONNECTED WHILE DRIVING
INCLUDE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR MUSIC PLAYING FROM CELL PHONE
BETTER ROUTING ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT IS NOT THE EASIEST TO READ CAN T TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD TO READ A MAP IF MY VEHICLE HAS VOICE NAVIGATION I DON T KNOW HOW TO ACCESS IT
I M JUST TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH TECH STUFF
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IS SLOW AND FRUSTRATING
AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH CONNECTIVITY AND IT IS DISTRACTING TO USE
BETTER CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL BETTER QUALITY SPEAKERS USE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS BE ABLE PLAY MUSIC FROM IPHONE OVER BLUETOOTH BETTER ACCESS TO IPHONE CONTACTS LIST USING VERBAL COMMANDS LIKE MY 13 VW BEETLE TECH EDITION HAS BE ABLE TO
NEED TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT PHONE MUSIC THROUGH BLUETOOTH WITHOUT NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE VOICE COMMUNICATIONS AREN T GOOD CAN T REALLY USE THEM AT ALL
I CAN SWITCH AROUND AND PLAY THE RADIO THEN A CD THEN MY IPAD THEN MY PHONE
TOO MANY STEPS TO MAKE A CALL TO SOMEONE ON MY PHONE USING THE CAR S COMMUNICATION BLUETOOTH SOFTWARE
WISH THERE WAS A BACK BUTTON ON MY STEERING WHEEL BC WHEN I M DRIVING AND TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THE IPOD SELECTIONS I HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO TOUCH A TINY BACK BUTTON IF I WANT TO SEARCH USING DIFFERENT PARAMETERS ARTIST ALBUM
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR CALLING NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS OUT COULD IT POSSIBLY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHERE THE SPEAKER WAS LOCATED IN THE VEHICLE
VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE VEHICLE
HATE THE NAVIGATION
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR CALLS
ACOUSTICS OF THE VEHICLE IS BAD THE SPEAKERS ARE UNDER POWERED TOUCH CONTROLS FOR RADIO IS DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING YOU CAN NOT CHANGE THE NAVIGATION IF THE VEHICLE IS MOVING THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO PULL OVER IF YOU DECIDE TO CHANGE YOUR ROUTE
I DIDNT EVEN KNOW I HAD VOICE RECOGNITION NAVIGATION NEEDS UPDATED MAPS SOMETIMES NAVIGATION TAKES YOU WAY OUT OF YOUR INTENDED DESTINATION
APPARENTLY I CANNOT NAME A SAVED DESTINATION I LIKE MY OLD GARMIN GPS BETTER
SPEAKER SOUND WAS SURPRISED THAT THEY WERE BOSE REALLY HAVE TO TURN UP THE VOLUME
TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO PLACE A USB PORT OUTSIDE OF THE MIDDLE CONSOLE SPEAKERS CRACKLE
MAKE THE NAV USER FRIENDLY
IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHO I AM SPEAKING TOO ALSO IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO MAKE PHONE CALLS USING THE PROGRAM IN THE PATHFINDER I USUALLY USE SIRI TO MAKE CALLS FOR ME
ALLOW USE OF GOOGLE MAPS THROUGH NAVIGATION GOOGLE MAPS IS MUCH MORE ACCURATE EASIER TO USE AND UPDATES AUTOMATICALLY AT NOT CHARGE
NOT USED TO USING TOO MANY FEATURES WHILE DRIVING THAT IS FOR THE YOUNG MULTI TASKERS HANDS FREE PHONE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH DISTRACTION WHILE DRIVING
FIX THE ISSUE WITH PHONES CONNECTED THROUGH BLUETOOTH THAT ARE ALSO USED TO PLAYBACK AUDIO THE SYSTEM WILL AUTOMATICALLY PAIR WITH A PHONE AND HAS NO PROBLEMS MAKING PHONE CALLS BUT IF THAT PHONE WAS NOT THE LAST ONE USED FOR PLAYING MUSIC THEN
THE BUILT IN PHONE SYSTEM AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM DON T WORK WELL AND ARE EXTREMELY HARD TO USE I MUCH PREFER JUST LINKING MY IPHONE USING BLUETOOTH AND THEN USING MY PHONE FOR EVERYTHING
BLUETOOTH IS BETTER THAN MY MAXIMA HOWEVER I WISH MY VEHICHLE COULD READ TEXT NAVIGATION IS TOUGH TO USE AND TYPE IN I RATHER SPEAK INTO MY PHONE AND HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR ADDRESS AND TEXT
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE VOICE RECOGNITION COULD UNDERSTAND ME BETTER
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BRINGS MY ENTIRE RATING DOWN IF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WAS MORE INTUITIVE IT WOULD HELP ME USE IT EVERYDAY
IPHONE CONNECTIVITY
MORE QUALITY FOR VOICE COMING THRU THE BLUETOOTH PHONE
IT SHOULD NOT TAKE MULTIPLE STEPS TO INPUT A DESTINATION EITHER VERBALLY OR BY TOUCH SCREEN I HAVE OWNED MULTIPLE CARS WITH NAVIGATION SYSTEMS AND MULTIPLE STAND ALONE GPS SYSTEMS AND THIS HAS BEEN BY FAR THE MOST DIFFICULT TO MASTER BY THE
THE NISSAN APPS HAS NOT WORKED SMOOTHLY FROM THE DAY I PURCHASED IT I DO NOT HAVE MUCH INTEREST IN THAT FEATURE SO I DO NOT PARTICULARLY MIND I SUPPOSE I NEVER GET UPSET ABOUT IT BECAUSE I AM NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT I AM MISSING
AIRPLAY CONNECTIVITY FOR OPTION VOICE RECOGNITION ADVANCES
USER SETTINGS ARE SOMETIMES CONVOLUTED AND NOT EASY TO NAVIGATE I VE EXPERIENCED POOR DIRECTIONS WHEN USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO KIND OF KNOW WHERE YOU RE GOING BEFORE HAND FASTEST AND SHORTEST DON T ALWAYS WORK AS EXPECTED
HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING PANDORA AND IHEART RADIO TO CONNECT
SIRIUS XM TRAFFIC IS TERRIBLE DOES NOT HELP WITH MAJOR FREEWAYS
I HAVE FOUND THE INTERNET SEARCH CAPABILITIES OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOMEWHAT CUMBERSOME AND VERY TIRESOME AND AWKWARD TO USE GOOGLE FORMATTING IS FAR SUPERIOR FOR SEARCHING
WE STILL WANT TO PLAY CDS ON LONG TRIPS AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AT THE SAME TIME THE KIDS WATCH A MOVIE
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS TO HAVE A WIDER REPERTOIRE OF NAMES TO RECOGNIZE EX LYDIA MARCO ETC ARE NOT RECOGNIZED
I HAVE THE MIDDLE OF THE GRADE MODEL AND IT DOESN T HAVE AN AUX JACK I WENT OUT TO BUY AN ACCESS INTERNET CONNECTOR TO BE ABLE TO PLAY MY MUSIC FROM MY CELLPHONE
THE NEXT SONG CONTROL FROM STEERING WHEEL DOESN T ALWAYS WORK SPEAKERS AREN T THE BEST SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO PAIR BLUETOOTH WITH CAR
TOUCH SCREEN IN THE ALL SL MODELS
THE COLORS COULD BE IMPROVED MY GARMIN HAD MORE COLORS ON THE SCREEN SO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE ROGUE IS A LITTLE BLAND COMPARED TO THE GARMIN
MY PATHFINDER DOES NOT HAVE NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION FEATURES
CONTRAST ON THE MAP MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE THE ROADS ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS SUNNY THE ROADS SHOULD BE INDICATED WITH DARKER LINES
I DON T LIKE THAT THE RADIO ONLY HAS TOUCH PAD FOR CHANGING THE RADIO STATIONS IT S UNSAFE &DISTRACTING WHEN YOUR DRIVING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND PUSH SEVERAL TIMES TO CHANGE THE STATION THE SCREEN IS ALWAYS DIRTY AND SMUDGY
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE MORE CONSISTENTLY SUCCESSFUL THIS HAS BEEN A FRUSTRATING ISSUE
NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THE APPS
UNFORTUNATELY FOR NISSAN OUR OTHER CAR IS A FORD AND THE SYNC IS FAR SUPERIOR THEN WHAT NISSAN HAS NIGHT AND DAY DIFFERENT
ABILITY TO CONNECT TO OTHER APPLICATIONS VIA BLUETOOTH THAN JUST PHONE CALLS AND PLACEMENT OF JACKS
THE COST OF THE SIRIUS RADIO AFTER FREE PERIOD NOT VERY ECONOMICAL
AUDIO IS VERY GOOD VOICE ACTIVATED PHONE SOMETIMES HAS ISSUES DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU SPEAK
VOICE RECOGNITION
USING THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR NAVIGATION IS A BIT CONVALUTED WHEN YOU RE DRIVING HAVE TO KEEP DIGGING FOR THINGS NOT ENOUGH DETAILED CATEGORIES AND I FIND MYSELF GOING BACK TO THE BEGINNING TO START OVER TO FIND SOMETHING I M SURE I NEED TO PRACT
THE VOLUME FROM THE SIRIUSXM RADIO NEVER GETS LOUD ENOUGH
I REALLY DON T KNOW HOW TO USE ALL OF THE FEATURES I DON T KNOW HOW TO CONNECT MY PHONE AND IPAD TO SEND AND RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES
MULTIPLE CD PLAYER
BLUETOOTH PEOPLE CANT HEAR ME WELL
WHEN PLAYING MUSIC USING BLUETOOTH AUDIO THE PLAYER IN THE CAR WON T PLAY THE SONGS IN A SHUFFLE MATTER EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE SHUFFLE OPTION IN MY PHONE IF USING PANDORA VIA BLUETOOTH SOMETIMES THE SYSTEM WILL GO SILENT DUE TO COMMERCIALS PLAY
SOUND COULD BE BETTER WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH
POOR QUALITY OF CALL ON BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
I WISH THE BLUETOOTH OF THE CAR COULD ALSO CONNECT TO AUDIO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AMAZING INVESTMENT TO HAVE KNOWN THAT I COULD PLAY MUSIC THROUGH MY PHONE IN BLUETOOTH
I COULD NOT HOOK UP MY DAUGHTERS IPOD
I WISH THE BLUETOOTH SOUND QUALITY WAS BETTER TO EXCEPTIONAL BUT IT IS NOT AT THIS POINT MORE MONEY OR TECHNOLOGY NEEDS TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE THIS FEATURE
I HAVEN T USED THE BLUETOOTH THING YET AND I DON T HAVE BUILT IN GPS
VOLUME DURING PHONE CALLS
RADIO AND SPEAKERS ARE POOR QUALITY COMPARED TO A GOOD AFTER MARKET SETUP SUCH AS ALPINE OR KENWOOD
STANDARD NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS MUST
BLUETOOTH TOO MANY QUESTIONS ASKED BY SYSTEM DURING DRIVING SUGGESTION HAVE THE SYSTEM ASK FOR HOME MOBILE OR WORK RATHER THAN READING ALL THE PHONE NUMBERS
THE NAV SYSTEM DOES NOT STORE FAVORITES ONLY HOME
PLEASE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED UPON QUICK AND EASY ACCESS IS VERY IMPORTANT ALSO THE COMPUTER LADY SHOULD BE ABLE TO EASILY RECOGNIZE MY VOICE AND ACCENT
VOLUME OF BLUETOOTH DEFAULTS TO A VERY LOW SETTING NEED TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE DEFAULT SETTING
WHEN TALKING THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH ON A PHONE CALL IT BREAKS UP SOMETIMES AND CAN BE HARD TO HEAR ALSO WHEN THE PHONE RINGS THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH YOU HAVE TO TURN THE VOLUME UP EACH TIME YOU CANT SET THE VOLUME FOR CALLS AHEAD OF TIME SO YOU DO
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE COMMANDS ARE NOT EXPRESSED IN A CLEAR TO UNDERSTAND MANNER OFTEN TOO COMPLICATED TO ACHIEVE DESIRED RESULT I PURCHASED THE UPGRADED ACCESSORY PACKAGE TO GET THE BOSE AUDIO SYSTEM THE QUALITY OF THAT IS VERY
ABILITY TO PAIR PHONE AND AUDIO EFFECTIVELY THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH AND UPGRADING THE SPEAKERS
I NOTICED THE MAP WAS OUT OF DATE WHEN THE SPEED LIMITS LISTED ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DID NOT MATCH THE CURRENT SPEED LIMIT CHANGES I QUESTIONED THE OUT OF DATE INFORMATION BECAUSE I HAVE A PORTABLE GARMIN SYSTEM THAT DOES SHOW THE CURRENT SPEE
CAN YOU DO HANDS FREE TEXTING IT WAS INDICATED EARLIER IN THIS SURVEY
CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY PLAY IPHONE MUSIC USING BLUETOOTH OR PLUGGED IN
THE NISSAN APP IS A JOKE AND DOESN T WORK IN FACT MY PANDORA QUIT DISPLAYING THE AUTHOR TITLE AND TRACK INFO UNTIL I DELETED THE APP I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO THE REVIEWS AND NOT WASTED MY TIME TRYING IT OUT
THE FACTORY SPEAKERS ARE NOT THAT GREAT AND THE VOLUME CHANGES FROM ONE DEVICE TO ANOTHER FOR EXAMPLE IF I SWITCH FROM BLUETOOTH TO FM RADIO THEN THE VOLUME CHANGES AS WELL
FREE SIRIUS XM ALL THE TIME FOR THE LIFE OF THE CAR FOR WHAT THE CAR COSTS IT SEEMS PETTY TO CHARGE FOR RADIO
THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE IS NOT VERY AUDIBLE DURING NORMAL DRIVING MAKING CALLS FROM IT ARE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR AT SPEEDS ABOVE 50 MPH
VOICE RECOGNITION AND THEY HAVE CHANGED FROM THE MAKING VOICE CONTROL CALLS NOW TAKES AN EXTRA STEP IT WORKED BETTER BEFORE IF IT ISN T BROKEN DON T FIX IT
I WISH I COULD SEND TEXT MESSAGES AND START SPOTIFY VIA VOICE COMMANDS
I CANNOT GET MY PHONE TO CONNECT VIA THE NISSANCONNECT APP WHICH IS ANNOYING
IT IS DIFFICULT TO LOCK THE NAVIGATION SCREEN SO THAT IT DOESN T SWITCH BACK TO THE CLOCK ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TURN OFF NAVIGATION WHEN NOT IN USE
DIFFICULT FOR CALLER TO HEAR AND UNDERSTAND CALLERS COMPLAIN I SOUND FAR AWAY OR IN A HOLE WHEN USING HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH AT TIMES I SOMETIMES WILL HEAR AN ECHO WHEN THE CALLER SPEAKS
I FIND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IN THIS CAR TO BE AWFUL THE RESPONSE TIME FOR THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS ALSO AWFUL AND WHEN SHE DOES RESPOND IT S WRONG BC SHE CAN T HEAR ME OR SOMETHING BUT I DON T EVEN REALLY USE IT BC IT IS THAT BAD SUCKS
QUICKER START UP OF USB FOR MUSIC THIS IS HOW I PLAY MY MUSIC AND IT ALWAYS TAKES TOO LONG TO START PLAYING WHEN STARTING THE CAR
I THINK IT HAS REALLY NICE FEATURES SOME OF THE BUGS JUST NEED TO BE WORKED OUT OF THE BLUETOOTH TROUBLES CONNECTING AND THEN I WOULD GIVE IT A 9 OR 10
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY ASIDE FROM THE PHONE IS TERRIBLE SO ALL OF THOSE FEATURES WHICH SEEM GREAT ARE UNUSABLE
THE NEW TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM IS A MUCH WELCOME IMPROVEMENT OVER THE ONE IN MY OLDER SUBARU IMPREZA
CONNECTIVITY VOICE RECOGNITION
THE STAR LINK APP WOULD BE BETTER SUITED IF IT COULD BE ADAPTED BY THE USER TO SUIT THEIR APP NEEDS WHEN PLAYING AUDIO VIA BLUETOOTH SUCH AS USING A SCANNER APP IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF THE RADIO ACKNOWLEDGED THAT YOU WERE RECIEVING THAT TYPE OF AU
THE BACKUP CAMERA SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO SEE IN THE SUNLIGHT
EASIER TO CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH
BLUETOOTH IS HARD TO USE FOR THINGS LIKE PLAYING MUSIC FROM A DEVICE IT OFTEN DISCONNECTS AND HAS TROUBLE RECONNECTING THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND THROUGH THE SPEAKERS WHILE PLAYING MUSIC IS BELOW AVERAGE OVERALL I THINK THE LOOK OF THE CONSOLE I
MAKE VOICE RECOGNITION WORK AND EASIER TO USE PLEASE AND JUST REPLACE YOUR ELECTRONIC SYSTEM WITH AN ANDROID TABLET
THE STARLINK APP IS SO LIMITED THAT I HAVE NEVER USED IT I DON T LIKE PANDORA SINCE I ALREADY SUBSCRIBE TO SPOTIFY SO I HAVE TO USE THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE TO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC I WISH I COULD INSTALL ADDITIONAL APPS ON THE SUBARU BUT FOR NOW I
RADIO STATION CONTROL TOO SENSITIVE CHANGES WITH ACCIDENTAL TOUCH NAVIGATION NOT ALWAYS CORRECT
IPOD EASE OF USE AND CONTROL ON SCREEN DON T CARE ABOUT APPS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SOMETIMES NOT RELIABLE AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO OFFER TEXT OF STEPS IN ROUTE WHICH WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED
I CALLED SOMEONE ONCE BLUETOOTH HANDS FREE THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END SAID IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR UNDERSTAND ME
QUALITY OF SOUND FOR PHONE CALLS
TOUCH SCREEN COULD BE A BIT MORE RESPONSIVE
I DO NOT LIKE THE SURROUND SOUND IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS ALL COMING FROM THE MAIN FRONT SPEAKER I WOULD RATHER IT WAS JUST A STEREO SYSTEM I CANNOT CHANGE IT MANUALLY LIKE MY LAST CAR A FORD FUSION
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BETTER SPEAKERS THE SOUND QUALITY IS JUST NOT THERE
DISPLAY IPOD ON VEHICLE SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION AND AUDIO STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
PHONE CALL AUDIO COULD SOUND BETTER
SHORTEN THE TIME TO BOOT UP SHORTEN THE TIME TO READ USB FLASH CARD WITH MUSIC ON IT IT TAKES 10 15 MINUTES EVERY TIME I START THE CAR TO SEE MY FLASH CARD MUSIC MENU
REMOVE THE INABILITY TO USE THE SYSTEM TOUCHSCREEN KEYPAD WHILE DRIVING AND REMOVE THE INABILITY TO ADJUST THE RADIO WHEN THE CAR IS IN REVERSE
MAKE THE APPS WORK VIA BLUETOOTH FOR IOS DEVICES
I DON T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE AUDIO HOWEVER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED MADE EASIER TO SELECT DESIGNATION AND THE SCREEN SHOULD BE BIGGER
USING A TOUCH SCREEN TO CHANGE FROM AM TO FM AND VICE VERSA AS WELL AS CHANGE STATIONS TAKES TOO MUCH ATTENTION AWAY FROM DRIVING THE OLD PUSH BUTTONS TAKE LESS ATTENTION
MAKE THEM MORE INTUITIVE UBDERSTANDABLE EASY TO USE WIPER AND HEADLIGHT CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND CONFUSING VISUALLY
NAV SYSTEM
NAVIGATION IS NOT AT ALL INTUITIVE AND DIFFICULT TO OPERATE HATE THE FACT THAT BLUETOOTH IPHONE CONNECTION AUTOMATICALLY STARTS PLAYING WHEN I GET IN THE CAR HATE THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO SEARCH FOR IPOD CONNECTIVITY EVERY TIME I GET INTO THE C
SOUND QUALITY OF SPEAKERS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OFTEN TAKES A WHILE TO LOAD I LL BE IN THE PROCESS OF ENTERING A DESTINATION AND IT WILL FREEZE FOR UP TO TEN MINUTES
MAKE THE TOUCH RESPONSE ON THE NAVIGATION MORE FLUID SMARTPHONES FROM 3 YEARS AGO ARE MORE RESPONSIVE THE STARLINK APPLICATION LOOKS LIKE GARBAGE AND IS GENERALLY USELESS ID RECOMMEND USING ANDROID AUTO APPLE CARPLAY ALSO MY AFTERMARKET STEREO
NAVIGATION INPUT
HANDS FREE TEXT MESSAGING SHOULD BE ADDED
THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO FEATURE IS NOT GREAT YOU CAN LISTEN TO MUSIC ON THE IPHONE VIA BLUETOOTH BUT CAN T SEE THE PLAYLIST ON THE TOUCH SCREEN SO YOU HAVE TO CHANGE MUSIC ON THE PHONE
PEOPLE CAN T HEAR ME WHEN USING PHONE BLUETOOTH
RIDICULOUS THAT THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS COMPLETELY INACCESSIBLE WHEN THE CAR IS IN REVERSE CAN T EVEN TURN DOWN THE VOLUME BOO
PASSENGER CANNOT USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE CAR IS MOVING
PLACEMENT STRENGTH OF MICROPHONE SO MY VOICE IS HEARD BETTER BY THE PEOPLE I TALK WITH
NAVIGATION IS USELESS COMPARED TO GOOGLE MAPS ON A PAIRED SMARTPHONE
BETTER HIGHS AND LOWS WITH THE SPEAKERS PANDORA CONNECTIVITY
THE TOUCH SCREEN TO CHANGE RADIO STATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING AS I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND THE SPACE BETWEEN STATIONS IS CLOSE I FEEL MY EYES ARE OFF THE ROAD FOR TOO LONG
PROGRAMMING THE PRE SET RADIO STATIONS IS A BEAR NOT INTUITIVE AT ALL
THE AVAILABLE APPS ARE VERY RUDIMENTARY CONSIDERING THE CAPABILITIES OF TODAY S SMARTPHONES I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE ALL THE CONTENTS OF MY PHONE AND NOT JUST A COUPLE OF ELEMENTS I E PHONE AND MUSIC
I AM NEW TO MUCH OF THE NEWER SYSTEMS THEREFORE I AM STILL LEARNING I LIKE THE THINGS I KNOW HOW TO WORK AND I HOPE IN TIME I CAN FIGURE OUT THE OTHER SYSTEMS IE CRUISE CONTROL AND APPS ETC
AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE MORE RESPONSIVE POWERFUL ESPECIALLY AT LOWER VOLUMES KIND OF ON WEAK SIDE
LIKE BOSE SPEAKER SYSTEM
VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW TO RESPOND PANDORA APP NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS PHONES AND ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH SOME ANDROID PHONES NEEDS UPDATING
THE TECHNOLOGY USED FOR BLUETOOTH SYNCING OF PHONES IS STILL NOT VERY GOOD I HAD A HONDA CROSSTOUR WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY ERASED MY CONTACTS FROM MY PHONE BOOK EVERY FEW MONTHS MY WIFE HAS A HONDA CRV AND HER CALL QUALITY THROUGH HER CAR S SYSTEM
MORE APPS
WHILE DRIVING NOT THAT EASY TO NAVIGATE THE OPTIONS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IN CERTAIN BRIGHT LIGHT ALSO NOT EASY TO READ THE SCREEN
SCROLLING THROUGH RADIO PRESETS
VOICE COMMANDS MAY BE MY VOICE
THE MIRRORLINK OR STARLINK SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND DOES NOT WORK EVEN WITH APP DOWNLOADED TO DEVICE IT CONTINUALLY GIVES ERROR THAT APP NEEDS TO BE DOWNLOADED
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE VOICE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
STILL WORKING ON FIGURING OUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS I DON T USE IT OFTEN IT HAS FRUSTRATED ME
CONNECTIVITY WITH IPHONES COULD BE SHOULD BE BETTER
THE TOUCH SCREEN DOESN T ALWAYS RESPOND WHEN TOUCHED OR ELSE IT RESPONDS TOO MUCH I HAVE TO HAVE THE EXACT RIGHT TOUCH TO GET THE RIGHT STATION
IT DOESN T READ THAT MY PANDORA FOR EXAMPLE IS ON SO CONNECTIVITY TO APPLICATIONS COULD BE IMPROVED
LOVE THE SATELLITE RADIO DON T CARE FOR THE DISPLAY INDICATOR
VOICE RECOGNITION AND NAVIGATION ARE THE TWO AREAS THAT HAVE NOT MET MY EXPECTATIONS IN PART THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MAPS ARE OUTDATED LAST UPDATED THIRD QUARTER OF WITH ASSEMBLY LINE BUILD DATE OF FEB FOR THE VEHICLE THE FEATURES OF
DON T LIKE THE ORIENTATION OF THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS VISUALLY ON THE RADIO VOLUME DISPLAYS LEFT TO RIGHT STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS VOLUME USING ARROWS UP AND DOWN RADIO STATIONS ARE DISPLAYED UP AND DOWN STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS STATIONS WITH L
WHEN I M PLAYING MUSIC AND THE VOICE OF NAVIGATOR CUTS IN I WISH NAVIGATOR WAS LOUDER AND MUSIC WOULD PAUSE
SPEAKERS TINNY SOUNDING ON HANDS FREE CALLS TO MUCH CABIN NOISE TO USE
I LOVED MY FORMER SUBARU BECAUSE YOU COULD USE A KNOB TO CHANGE THE RADIO STATION ALL MY FRIENDS LOVED THAT TOO I DON T LIKE TRYING TO FIND THE BALANCE FOR THE SPEAKERS I USUALLY JUST GIVE UP AFTER TRYING TO LOCATE IT IF I HAVE A NAVIGATION SY
STARLINK NEEDS A LOT OF WORK WAS HOPING FOR A CAR PLAY EXPERIENCE AND GOT LITTLE SUPPORT FOR PHONE APPS IN THE CAR BESIDES BASIC INTERNET RADIO SUPPORT WITH IPHONE CONTENT OF STARLINK IS WEAK GPS FROM PHONE WOULD BE TRULY EXCEPTIONAL
TOUCH SCREEN CAN BE TOUCHY BUT DO LIKE THE FACT IT HAS ON SOME CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL AND ACTUAL KNOBS TO CONTROL SOUND RADIO SYSTEM AND SPEAKER QUALITY SOUND MUCH IMPROVED FROM MY PREVIOUS SUBARU HAVEN T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE
THE DELAY BETWEEN USING SIRI WITH BLUETOOTH LEADS TO MISTAKES IT GOES INTO PHONE CALL MODE A DIRECT LINK NOT USING IT AS A PHONE CALL FOR INSTRUCTIONS AND SHORTENING THE DELAY TIME FOR BLUETOOTH DISCOVERY AND ACTIVATION
BETTER VOLUME CLEARER CALLS WHEN USING BLUETOOTH
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED SOUND SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED SEEMS TO LACK POWER AND QUALITY SOUND I MAY HAVE TO INSTALL AN AFTERMARKET AMPLIFIER
THE SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE I OPTED FOR THE NON GPS HEAD UNIT AND UPGRADED KICKER SPEAKERS AND TWEETERS NO SUB IT SOUNDS DEAD THE OUTPUT IS LOW AND I FRANKLY FEEL RIPPED OFF HAVING PUT ANY MONEY INTO IT
I D HAVE BOUGHT THE NAV SYSTEM IF IT WAS AS EASY AND CHEAP TO UPGRADE AS MY GARMIN UNIT ALL CARS SHOULD HAVE A NAV UNIT BUILT IN AND SHOULD BE UPGRADABLE VIA A DOWNLOAD FROM THE INTERNET ONTO A THUMB DRIVE FOR UPDATING
BETTER BLUETOOTH QUALITY
I REALLY PREFER KNOBS AND BUTTONS WHEN I HAVE TO ADJUST VOLUME I HAVE FREQUENTLY ACCIDENTALLY TOUCHED THE SCREEN AND CHANGED THE RADIO STATION INADVERTENTLY THIS CAN BE QUITE STARTLING AND UNPLEASANT
BETTER SPEAKERS BETTER SOUND QUALITY WITH BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTION
BLUETOOTH CALLS IMPROVE NOISE CANCELLATION OF MICROPHONE IMPROVE CALL FOR OTHER PARTY
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WITH IPHONE 6 FOR USE WITH PANDORA AND OTHER APPS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SWITCH BETWEEN XM1 AND XM2 WITHOUT TAKING YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD BECAUSE OF THE TOUCH SCREEN FEATURE THE CAR RIDES ROUGH WHICH IS EXPECTED AND MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO HIT THE XM TOUCH SCREEN BUTTON WITHOUT LOOKING AWAY FROM TH
BLUETOOTH CALLING EASE OF USE FEATURES WHILE DRIVING
NAVIGATION LOGS ALL TRAFFIC ALERTS EVEN IF THE ALERT IS TRAFFIC MOVING FREELY THERE S NO WAY TO FILTER FOR JUST THE BLOCKING ISSUES THE RESULTING ICONS CLUTTER THE DISPLAY EACH SEGMENT OF FREEWAY HAS AN ALERT OVER IT SO THERE S NO WAY TO E
THE HEAD UNIT IS SO TERRIBLE I REPLACED IT WITH A PIONEER UNIT
TOUCH SCREEN IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO CASUAL FINGER CONTACT ALMOST LIKE SENSITIVITY TO HOVERING YOUR FINGER OVER THE SCREEN A MILD BRUSHING ANYWHERE ON THE SCREEN THROWS THINGS OFF
BLUETOOTH SOUND QUALITY TO CALLER
THERE IS NO NAV SYSTEM ROAD NOISE IS SO BAY YOU CAN T HEAR THE RADIO
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION ABILITY TO ADD NEW APPS TO THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM
WHEN I ANSWER A CALL USING HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH I ALWAYS HAVE TO ASK THE CALLER TO SPEAK UP BECAUSE IT ISN T VERY CLEAR OR LOUD
THERE IS NO NAVIGATION OR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM BLUETOOTH HARD TO USE SO I DON T BOTHER USING IT RADIO IS OK WHEN HD SIGNAL IS GOOD SOUND FROM SPEAKERS IS GREAT
AT TIMES CUMBERSOME TO USE AND THE MIC FOR HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS DOES NOT PRODUCE GOOD SOUND ON THE OTHER END OF THE CALL
INCOMING CALLS ON BLUETOOTH SOUND FUZZY
IN CALL SOUND AUDIO QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED THE SOUND QUALITY OF CALLER OR PERSON YOU HAVE CALLED COULD BE CLEARER
NAV ALWAYS SEEMS TO WANT TO TAKE ME BACK TO MAIN ROADS EVEN IF I D BE CLOSER TO HOME USING SIDE ROADS
THERE SHOULD BE A WAY FOR A PASSENGER TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION
VOICE COMMANDS COULD NOT BE WORSE
VOICE COMMAND REGONITION
HARD TO HEAR CLEARLY WHEN PHONE CONNECTED TO BLUETOOTH
IT COULD BE EASIER TO USE VOICE COMMAND TO FIND A LOCATION
PLEASE OFFER A 7 NAVIGATION SCREEN
THE VOICE RECOGNITION ACTUALLY RECOGNIZIGN WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY IS HIT AND MISS FREQUENTLY THE POINTS OF INTEREST FEATURE IS UNABLE TO LOCATE THE DESTINATION OR TAKES TOO MUCH EFFORT TO LOCATE
THE APPS DO NOT WORK
THE TOUCH SCREEN RADIO CHANNEL BUTTONS COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER FOR THOSE OF US WITH FAT FINGERS
NAVIGATING CONTACTS FOR PHONE CALLS
VOICE COMMAND RECOGNITION
SOUND SYSTEM SHOULD INCLUDE THE JBL AUDIO THAT IS ONLY AVAILABLE ON THE LIMITED VERSION 4RUNNER THAT SHOULD THEORETICALLY IMPROVE THE CALL CLARITY WHEN MAKING CALLS I DO NOT DRIVE THE VEHICLE AS A DAILY DRIVER SO I MAY HAVE HAD OTHER MORE PRESS
VOICE RECOGNITION OF ME
MAKE THE VOICE RECOGNITION WORK OR TAKE IT OUT
IN AN ALTERED MODEL SUCH AT THE TRD PRO THE JBL SPEAKERS WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE ADDITION
TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS ARE CONFUSING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS POOR
VOICE RECOGNITION IS DIFFICULT
PASSENGER CANNOT MODIFIED NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE CAR IS MOVING THIS MEANS YOU HAVE TO PULL OVER AND STOP THE CAR IN ORDER TO CHANGE YOUR DESTINATION OR ADD A DESTINATION WHILE YOU RE ALREADY IN ROUTE THIS IS VERY INCONVENIENT AND UNSAFE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS PLENTY OF QUIRKS THE VOLUME CONTROL TAKES A LOT OF TURNING OR BUTTON PUSHING ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO CHANGE VOLUME
THE MAIN OR DETAILED INSTRUCTION MANUAL FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY EXTENSIVE AND NOT THAT EASY TO FOLLOW
NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO DIFFICULT
DIFFICULT TO ADJUST TO USING AFTER YEARS OF USING A GARMIN
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT CONSISTENT AND IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING I END UP USING MY MOBILE PHONE NAVIGATION SYSTEM INSTEAD
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY WHILE WEARING POLARIZED SUNGLASSES SO WHILE DRIVING DURING THE DAY I HAVE TO REMOVE MY SUNGLASSES TO GLANCE AT THE DISPLAY CHANGE SONGS OR WHAT NOT
THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND RESPONSE TIME COULD BE IMPROVED
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT VERY EASY TO USE OR AS VISUALLY PLEASING AS COMPETING PRODUCTS FROM GARMIN
ALLOW USE BY PASSENGER WHEN CAR IS MOVING THE CAR KNOWS WHEN A PASSENGER IS IN OR NOT SO THEREFORE A CONTROL ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FOR NAVIGATION ETC COULD BE USED WHILE DRIVING
THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM INTERFERES WITH DRIVER CONCENTRATION A PUSH BUTTON RADIO WOULD BE PREFERABLE
SELDOM USE DUE TO POOR VOICE RECOGNITION
THERE IS QUITE A LOT OF INFORMATION TO LEARN ABOUT OPERATING THE AUDIO AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS EFFECTIVELY THE OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS ARE HELPFUL JUST A LOT TO LEARN
NOT BEING ABLE TO INPUT INFORMATION INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM UNLESS THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED THE PASSENGER CANNOT EVEN INPUT INFORMATION SO WE NEED TO PULL OVER AND STOP FOR THINGS THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE MAYBE A DRIVER PASSENGER UNLOCK FUNCTI
UPDATE THE MAP INFORMATION OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND CORRECT THE ERRORS
MAKE NAV SYSTEM EASIER
I DON T LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN IT DOES NOT ALWAYS RESPOND
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOES NOT RESPOND CORRECTLY WHEN ASKING FOR A NAME AND PHONE NUMBER ALMOST ALWAYS DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE COMMAND VERY FRUSTRATING
VOICE RECOGNITION COMMANDS WERE BETTER IN THE PRIUS THIS ONE SEEMS TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH MORE STEPS TO GET THE INFORMATION DESIRED
WOULD BE NICE TO TALK THE ADDRESS INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN PHONE AND CAR SOMETIMES THE ENTUNE APP DOES NOT START BUT THE CAR IS CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH TO THE PHONE
GET RID OF THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR SELECTING RADIO CHANNELS TOUCH SCREEN WORKS GREAT FOR IPOD CD AND PHONE THOUGH
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM MAKES THIS AREA DIFFICULT TO RATE
NAVIGATION SOUND LEVEL SHOULD BE EASIER TO CONTROL
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL QUALITY OF RECEPTION FOR PHONE CALLS IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR
TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT OBVIOUS AND I HAVEN T TAKEN THE TIME TO READ THE BOOK THE TELEPHONE THROUGH THE SYSTEM I DON T LIKE SO I HAVE TURNED IT OFF THE TALK WASN T CLEAR
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MY SMART PHONE AND THE CAR HAS BEEN LOST SEVERAL TIMES I GET A CALL OR TEXT ON MY PHONE AND IT DOES NOT SHOW OR COME THROUGH ON MY CAR THEREFORE I HAVE MISSED CALLS AND TEXTS WHILE DRIVING PLEASE CORRECT THAT
INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE AREA ON THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR EACH CHANNEL IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL USING THE SCREEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD AND CONCENTRATE ON THE SCREEN THIS IS A DANGEROUS COMBINATION
HAVE NOT USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
DO NOT USE PHONE OR INTERNET APPS SO IT S DIFFICULT TO RATE THESE FEATURES
THERE SHOULD BE A WEIGHT ON SEAT SWITCH IN THE PASSENGER SEAT TO ACTIVATE THE NAV SYSTEM SO HE SHE COULD USE IT WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION
LARGER DIGITAL DISPLAY ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM
PHONE CONNECTIVITY SUBSTANDARD NAV CONTROLS CONFUSING ESP WHEN TRYING TO ENTER A NEW ADDRESS SWITCHING BETWEEN AUDIO SOURCES DIFFICULT
I HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY SAVING ADDRESSES IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAVIGATION NEEDS BETTER UPDATES IT IS BEHIND AT LEAST A YEAR ON INFRASTRUCTURE AND IS NOT UP TO DATE WITH POIS THE SYSTEM HAS ALSO STRUGGLED AS OF LATE TO PICK UP ON CERTAIN VOICE COMMANDS OVERALL GREAT SYSTEM JUST NEEDS UPDATES
VOICE COMMANDS AND EASIER NAVIGATION SYSTEM
CHANGING THE AUDIO SOURCE SHOULD BE EASIER AND THE LABELING OF SATELLITE STATIONS SHOULD USE THE NAMES OF THE STATIONS AND NOT JUST THEIR CHANNEL NUMBER
CONNECTIVITY IS NOT ALWAYS AS PREDICTABLE AS CAN BE THE SOUND QUALITY OF TEXT MESSAGES OR PHONE CALLS CAN BE ENHANCED FURTHER
CANT SEEM TO MAKE VOICE RECOGNITION WORK WELL
EASIER TO CONNECT SMART PHONE WI FI CAN NOT CONNECT PHONE WHE DRIVING PASSANGER SHOULD BE ABLE
EASIER TO ADD A NEW RADIO STATION
SPEAKERS HAVE LOW SOUND QUALITY
NAVIGATION ADDRESS INPUT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT WHEN THE SYSTEM TAKES OVER AND PROVIDES AUTO SUGGESTIONS I THINK THAT THE KEYBOARD SHOULD NEVER BE GRAYED OUT LEAVE ALL KEYS ACTIVE TO CHOOSE FROM
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF THE VEHICLE WOULD HAVE COME EQUIPPED WITH SIRIUS
BETTER COMPREHENSION OF PHONE DIALING COMMANDS FROM VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM BETTER COMPATIBILITY WITH EXISTING PHONE S NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DUE TO MY ACCENT OR THE SYSTEM BEING PROGRAMMED TO RECOGNISE ONLY SPECIFIC PHASES OUTSTANDING RATING FOR ASPECTS OTHER THAN VOICE RECOGNITION
A NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE DON T HAVE THAT
BEING ABLE TO ADJUST THE VOICE VOLUME OF THE NAV SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE OR MISINTERPRETS ALMOST EVERY COMMAND
I WOULD HAVE LIKED THE OPTION TO HAVE SIRIUS XM RADIO IN MY CAR
I WISH IT HAD NAVIGATION AND SATELLITE RADIO
THE HANDS FREE BLUETHTOOTH SYSTEM IN THIS VEHICLE IS A DISTRACTION TO SAY THE LEAST
SETTING UP THE NAVIGATION I CAN T ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT IT COULD BE ME
SOUND QUALITY NEEDS WORK
JUST THE CONNECTIVITY ISSUE
IT SEEMS THAT I HAVE TO USE THE TOUCHSCREEN MORE THAN I WANT RATHER THAN USING USING CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL WHICH I PREFER FOR SAFETY REASONS AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED
IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW YOU CAN ACTUALLY STOP THE NAVIGATION GUIDANCE IF YOU W ANT TO CANCEL IT BEFORE YOU REACH YOUR DESTINATION ALSO IF YOU HAVE YOUR PHONE CONNECTED TO THE CAR VIA BLUETOOTH YOU CAN NOT HEAR THE NAVIGATION INSTRUCTIONS ON YOUR PH
THERE ARE SPECIFIC VOICE COMMANDS THAT YOU MUST LEARN TO BE ABLE TO OOMMUNICATE TO THE VEHICLE LEARNING THESE HAVE BEEN CUMBERSOME
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN BASE MODELS
NAVIGATION COULD BE FRIENDLIER TO USE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT FRUSTRATES ME SOMETIMES IT HAS FEATURES THAT I HAVEN T USED THE USER MANUALS ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND I VE GONE TO THE MANUAL AND STILL DON T KNOW HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM
SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE PASSENGER PROGRAM NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE VEHICLE IS MOVING
OVERHAUL NAV AND GET RIDE OF ENTUNE
I LOVE THE OPTION TO HAVE TWO APPS ON THE DISPLAY AT THE SAME TIME BUT THAT MAKES BOTH VERY SMALL SO OF COURSE THE SCREEN NEEDS TO BE A BIT BIGGER
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE PASSENGER SET DESTINATIONS POI WHILE I AM DRIVING WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BLOCK ANY TEXTING ACTIVITY WHATSOEVER SEND & RECEIVE WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION PHONE CALLS WOULD STILL BE ALLOWED
PROGRAMMING OF RADIO STATIONS
MAKE IT EASIER TO SEND TEXT MESSAGES NOT REPLIES TO A RECEIVED TEXT MESSAGE WHILE DRIVING
THE INABILITY TO PROGRAM THE NAV SYSTEM BY THE PASSENGER REALLY PISSES ME OFF IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO HAVE TO PULL OFF ON THE HIGHWAY TO PROGRAM INFORMATION THAN IT WOULD BE TO MAKE CHANGES ON THE FLY
IN CAR MICROPHONE IS POOR QUALITY MY MOBILE PHONE CONNECTIONS CANNOT HEAR ME CLEARLY
USE OF THE DVD SYSTEM IS AWFUL THE HANDS FREE PHONE SYSTEM DOESN T WORK WELL CALLERS CANNOT HEAR ME DESPITE SPEAKING SLOWLY AND CLEARLY AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS OK BUT SOMEWHAT CUMBERSOME TO USE
SEE EARLIER COMMENT ON HANDS FREE DIALING
SOUND QUALITY FROM THE PREMIUM AUDIO IS REALLY BAD NAVIGATION SEEMS A LITTLE SLOW
NAVAGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO SCROLL AROUND IF YOU TOUCH THE SCREEN IT TAKES IT TO AN ADDRESS ALMOST ALL THE TIME YOU THEN HAVE TO CLEAR OUT THAT POINT
GREAT HANDS FREE FEATURES LOVE THE TEXTING WITHOUT TEXTING AND MESSAGE READ ABILITY
BLUETOOTH I VE BEEN TOLD SOUNDS LIKE I M IN A WIND TUNNEL
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED
CALLER S SOMETIME HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING OUT WHAT I AM SAYING SAMSUNG GALAXY SGH T999L
EVEN THOUGH MY PHONE IS CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH THE CAR DOESN T ALWAYS SEEM TO PICK IT UP AND I HAVE TO HARD WIRE INSTEAD THE MAP IS A LITTLE BUSY TO LOOK AT WHILE DRIVING THERE ISN T A WAY TO SEARCH BY A LOCATION NAME THAT I VE FOUND IN THE N
I DON T NEED THREE WAYS TO CHANGE THE RADIO STATION GET THAT BUTTON OFF THE STEERING WHEEL WHERE IT IS FAR TOO EASILY BUMPED
NISSAN CONNECT APPS SUCKS DOES NOT WORK
IMPROVE SOUND QUALITY OF ALL SYSTEMS
THE VOICE RECOGNITIONS SYSTEM SHOULD RECOGNIZE VOICE COMMANDS MORE EFFICIENTLY
THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS IS NOT GOOD THEY SOUND TINNY THE SUB WOOFER IS UNDER THE DRIVERS SEAT AND CAUSES ANNOYING VIBRATION THE RADIO RECEPTION IS NOT GOOD
THE APPS LIKE FACEBOOK ARE VERY BASIC AND RATHER POINTLESS TO USE IT TAKES TOO LONG FOR THE NEWSFEED TO LOAD PAGE BY PAGE AND THERE ARE NO PICTURES IT S ALSO HARD TO NAVIGATE QUICKLY BLUETOOTH IS GOOD AS LONG AS I MANUALLY CALL BECAUSE MY COMM
IMPROVEMENT BY HAVING AN AUX PORT OUTSIDE OF THE GLOVEBOX FOR AN ADDITIONAL OPTION
I HAVE NOT USED THE PHONE SYSTEM ALTHOUGH IT WAS VERY EASY TO SET UP I DO NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM ALTHOUGH I WILL ADD THAT TO MY NEXT VEHICLE I FOUND THAT SELECTING SONGS WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC IN MEDIA MODE USING A FLASH DRIVE IT IS
I VOICE COMMAND DOESN T WORK VERY WELL CANNOT TALK TO PEOPLE THRU THE BLUETOOTH AS THEY TELL ME IT S HARD TO HEAR ME NEED TO HAVE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS FOR SAFER OPERATION OF SYSTEM
NAVIGATION I CAN T ENTER GPS COORDINATES WITH TOUCH SCREEN KEYBOARD I HAVE TO CREATE A POINTS OF INTEREST FILE ON MY COMPUTER THEN LOAD IT TO A USB DRIVE AND THEN PLUG THE USB DRIVE INTO THE NAV SYSTEM
VOICES WHEN USING BLUETOOTH ARE GARBLED
THE SAVED RADIO STATIONS DO NOT WORK WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL BUTTONS
HD RADIO COMES IN AND OUT STILL DISAPPOINTING THAT XM SIRIUS RADIO IS NOT AVAILABLE TO ME A HIGHER QUALITY COMPONENT IS PREFERRED WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY OTHER OPTIONS
I HAD THE OPTIONAL SUB WOOFER INSTALLED BY THE DEALER THE BASS OUTPUT FROM THE SUB WOOFER IS OVER POWERING THE SUB WOOFER OUTPUT WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING A SEPARATE OUTPUT LEVEL CONTROL RATHER THAN HAVING TO REDUCE THE OVERALL BASS RESPONSE
WHERE MICROPHONE IS
TERRIBLE UI FOR THE SOUND AND NAV
NEEDS TO HAVE MODERN NAVIGATION SCREEN WITH BLUETOOTH TO PHONE AND CAMERA DISPLAY ETC
LOTS OF LAYERS TO THE MENU UNABLE TO HAVE PASSENGER CHANGE THE ROUTE WHILE DRIVING IN THE NAV SYSTEM DIFFICULTY WITH VOICE REC
THE TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE ESPECIALLY WHILE DRIVING
PROBABLY MY LEAST FAVORITE PART OF THIS WHOLE CAR IS THE WONKY AND HARD TO USE TOUCHSCREEN SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MORE INTITIVE I VE USED SEVERAL DIFFERENT GPS S AND THIS ONE IS HARD TO NAVIGATE MAYBE ONE DAY GPS WILL BE VOICE ACTIVATED THAT WORKS
IF POSSIBLE TO USE THE SAME SOFTWARE THAT GARMIN USES FOR MAPS AND NAVIGATION
WOULD LIKE MORE CD AVAILABLE THAN 1
EASY TO USE GOOD SOUND QUALITY
I HAVE NOT LISTENED OR USED THE AUDIO SYSTEM ENOUGH TO COMMENT
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED VOICE QUALITY AND ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE VOICE
DEPTH OF SOUND QUALITY MORE BASS CRISPER TREBLE
BLUETOOTH HAS TO HAVE EVERY PHONE NUMBER PROGRAMMED IN MY LAST CAR JUST READ MY PHONEBOOK FROM MY PHONE NO PROGRAMMING WHAT SO EVER
ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS WE HAVE ABOUT THE CAR IS HOW THE RADIO SYNCS WITH A BLUETOOTH PHONE 1 YOU CAN ONLY PAIR ONE DEVICE AT A TIME MY WIFE AND I BOTH USE THE CAR SO ONLY ONE OF US CAN HAVE THE CAR SETUP FOR HANDSFREE PHONE USE 2 YO
BECAUSE OF ROAD NOISE THE PERSON THE DRIVER IS CALLING WITH THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION CAN T UNDERSTAND OR HEAR THE DRIVER SO THE DRIVER MUST YELL AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS ITS EASIER JUST TO HOLD THE PHONE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WON T LET T
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CALL ANYONE FROM MY PHONE S CONTACT LIST BE USING A SIMPLE VOICE COMMAND IF THE PHONE IS CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH OR USB HOWEVER THE CONTACTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED
VOICE QUALITY OF CELL PHONE CALLER
I AM UNABLE TO USE MY VOICE RECOGNITION BECAUSE I WOULD NEED TO LOAD ALL THE CONTACTS INDIVIDUALLY AND IT IS WAY TOO TIME CONSUMING ALSO THE VOICE REGOGNITION MISINTERPRETED EVERYTIME I TRIED TO LOAD A CONTACT SO I JUST GAVE UP ON IT
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS PRETTY BAD
THE HANDS FREE DEVICE WAS NEVER INSTALLED AND I HAVE YET TO READ THE MANUAL TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT
HANDS FREE IS TOO LAYERED WITH HAVING TO SAY NAVIGATION FIRST OR HANDS FREE THEN EACH MENU ITEM YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUSH THE BUTTON AND SAY CALL MOM LIKE YOU CAN IN THE SUBARU LEGACY ALSO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SCROLL THROUGH IPOD SONGS
MY SATELLITE RADIO IS AFTERMARKET BECAUSE IT IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM FACTORY OR DEALER
THE HD RADIO SEEMS TO FADE IN AND OUT AT TIMES I WOULD HAVE LIKED THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY BUT DIDN T WANT TO PAY THE UPCHARGE FOR IT WISH IT CAME STANDARD AT THIS POINT
ADD STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
BETTER INTEGRATION WITH IPHONE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS VERY POOR STREET AND ROAD IDENTIFICATION
SPEAKERS WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY WERE BOSE I COULD TELL IMMEDIATELY PREMIUM SPEAKERS WERE NOT USED
THE TOUCH SCREEN COULD BE MADE MORE USER FRIENDLY
A TUTORIAL ON SOME ASPECTS WOULD BE HELPFUL I DON T KNOW IF I COULD TRUST REAL TIME TRAFFIC I HAVE TO PUNCH IN THE ADDRESSES BECAUSE THE NAVIGATION DOESN T UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY ALL OF THE TIME
THE SPEAKERS IN MY TOYOTA COROLLA HAD BETTER SOUND QUALITY
THE PHONE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT PERFECT BUT VERY GOOD I LIKE USING THE HANDS FREE AND LIKE HOW EASILY IT AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTS FOR ME
VOICE RECOGNITION AND SPEAKER QUALITY OFTEN SOUNDS TINNY
WE LIVE IN A RURAL AREA BUT OCCASIONALLY TRAVEL THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM HAS BEEN HELPFUL WE HAVE NOT USED THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM MUCH BUT THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS USED ALMOST ALL THE TIME AND WE THINK IT IS GREAT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT IN RECEIVING COMANDS
I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS
MANAGEMENT INTERFACE FOR PHONE CONTACTS AND USB AUDIO FILES SHOULD BE VIEWED AS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO TOYOTA
BEING ABLE TO FULLY OPERATE ALL ASPECTS OF THE RADIO AND NAV SYSTEM WHILE CAR IS IN MOTION
ENTERING ADDRESSES INTO NAV SYSTEM IS SLOW MAP SHOULD DISPLAY WITH DIRECTION TRAVELING UP NOT NORTH ALWAYS UP
TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY DIFFICULT TO TOUCH DESIRED BUTTON SYSTEM SCREEN REQUIRES TOO MUCH OF THE DRIVER S ATTENTION TOO DISTRACTING
BETTER AM SOUND QUALITY
THE VOICE RECOGNITION DID NOT UNDERSTAND US WE ASKED FOR IT TO CALL NICOLE AND IT GAVE US THE WEATHER FOR NEBRASKA THAT WAS THE ONLY TIME WE USED THE VOICE RECOGNITION
THE PHONE SYSTEM IS UNACCEPTABLE THE PEOPLE ON OTHER END OF PHONE CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE SPEAKER IN THE CAR
THE SYSTEM SHOULD SCROLL MY FAVORITES FIRST AND KNOW THEM BY FIRST NAME BEFORE ACCESSING THE REST OF MY CONTACTS
VOICE RECOGNITION THAT ACTUALLY RECOGNIZES SPEECH
DIRECTIONS FOR USE NEED TO MADE MORE UNDERSTANDABLE FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT TERRIBLY COMPUTER LITERATE ESPECIALLY THE RADIO I REALLY LIKE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM EASY TO UNDERSTAND
VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION DOESN T GET THE CORRECT RESULT FREQUENTLY
VOICE RECOGNITION IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IT ALMOST NEVER RECOGNIZES WHAT I SAY SECOND BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THE INTERMITTENT FAILURE OF THE TOUCHSCREEN THIRD BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THE DIFFICULTY IN USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
EXISTING STREETS ARE NOT ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM
BETTER EASIER ABILITY TO CONNECT BLUETOOTH FROM PHONE OR IPAD
THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS REALLY POOR IT S TO THE POINT YOU CAN T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE PERSON YOU RE TALKING TO SOMETIMES
THE SPEAKERS USING THE HANDS FREE PHONE ISN T HARD TO USE IT S JUST NOT CLEAR THE PARTY AT THE OTHER END HAS A HARD TIME HEARING THEREFORE I RARELY USE THE HANDSFREE PHONE
WHILE DRIVING IT IS HARD TO GET TO AND CHANGE THE BASS TREBLE FADE AND BALANCE AUDIO FEATURES PERHAPS YOU COULD MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO USE VOICE COMMANDS FOR CONTROLLING THESE AND OTHER FEATURES
WHEN MY MUSIC AUTOMATICALLY COMES ON VIA BLUETOOTH WHEN I GET IN THE CAR I HAVE TO REMEMBER TO TURN IT OFF OF BLUETOOTH WHEN I GET OUT OF THE CAR
HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO GET VOICE RECOGNITION OR GARAGE DOOR OPENER FUNCTIONS WORKING YET
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SELECT STATIONS ON XM BY TYPING NUMBERS DIRECTLY
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM AND STOP USING GIMMICKY THINGS LIKE GRACENOTE INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR APPLE CARPLAY OR WHATEVER GOOGLE USES LET THE OWNER DECIDE WHAT EXPERIENCE THEY WANT WITH THE VEHICLE AND PROVID
AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE MULTI DISC CHANGER SHOULD BE STANDARD ON PLATINUM
THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR COMMANDS IS OFTEN INACCURATE THE HANDS FREE TELEPHONE ONLY WORKS WELL WHEN THE HEATING AC IS TURNED OFF
PHONE CALLS OVER THE SPEAKERS SOUNDS TERRIBLE UNUSABLE VS OTHER SYSTEMS
VOICE RECOGNITION JUST DOESN T WORK WELL I CAN T USE IT AND PEOPLE CAN T HEAR ME WHEN I CALL THEM I CAN HEAR THEM VERY CLEARLY BUT THEY CAN T HEAR ME WELL AT ALL
COULD BE A MONTHLY UPDATING OF THE MAPS LIKE GOOGLE MAPS OR WAZE
BETTER SOUND QUALITY FROM THE SYSTEM ABILITY TO USE VOICE COMMAND TO ENTER A DESTINATION
ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON THE CAR IS HARD TO TYPE THE LETTER ON ADDRESS OR NUMBER ON SCREEN COMPARE TO G P S THAT LET ME DO SO EASY AND MORE QUICKLY
WOULD LIKE MORE SPEAKERS HAD TOYOTA SIENNA WITH 10 SPEAKERS  BOSE OPTION LOVED SOUND QUALITY CURRENT 6 SPEAKER SET UP IS LACKING DEPTH AND VOLUME
LOUDER VOLUME NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT SIMPLER TO USE
NAVIGATION
EASE OF PROGRAMMING IN ROUTES
AT THIS PRICE POINT I THINK NAV SHOULD BE STANDARD
I USE A GAMIN NUVI INSTEAD OF THE VEHICLE S NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NOT SURE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THIS VEHICLE
VOICE COMMAND NOT ACCURATE
NOT AS GOOD AS A PORTABLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
QUALITY OF BLUETOOTH AUDIO
BETTER LABELED MANUAL DIALS TOUCH SCREEN IS FINE
ABILITY TO SEND TEXT MESSAGES THROUGH VEHICLE SYSEM
PHONE AUDIO WAS CUTTING IN AND OUT HOWEVER I WAS BUSY DRIVING AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE PHONE NOT THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
LET SIRI WORK WITH THE AUDIO
I SELDOM USE OTHER THAN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THERE IS NO APPS TRAVEL OR WEATHER WHAT IS PLUS ABOUT THE ENTUNE
THE TECHNOLOGY ON THIS IS JUST POORLY DESIGNED IT IS HARD TO USE AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS AWFUL THE MAP NAVIGATION IS GOOD WHEN YOU CAN GET IT TO WORK EASILY IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU WANT AND THEN STILL HAS A HARD TIME
THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE IS PAINFUL HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO GET IT TO PAIR ONCE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE IT S NOT INTUITIVE AT ALL CONSEQUENTLY I DON T USE IT
FAILS TO LEARN VOICE COMMANDS EVEN WITH ONE USER MORE TROUBLE THEN IT S WORTH
SELECTING A RADIO STATION OR SELECTING A PERSON TO CALL IS DIFFICULT TO OPERATE WHILE DRIVING BORDERING ON UNSAFE AS IT REQUIRES MORE ATTENTION THAN IT SHOULD A DISTRACTION
THE TRAFFIC DISPLAY HAS ONLY TWO ZOOM SETTINGS WHICH MAKES IT VIRTUALLY USELESS IN CITY DRIVING SELECTING AUDIO STATIONS OR SEARCHING AUDIO FOLDERS IN MY PHONE IS DIFFICULT ON THE VEHICLE S TOUCHSCREEN OR WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS IF Y
NAVIGATION GPS WAS NOT AVAILABLE ON THIS SYSTEM I MISS A COMPASS ON THIS MODEL WAS ON MY RAM TRUCK
MY VEHICLE COMES EQUIPPED WITH THE JBL UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM IN MY OPINION ITS NOT ANY BETTER THAN A STANDARD AUDIO SYSTEM
THE VOICE RECOGNITION CAN BE BETTER INTEGRATED INTO THE IPHONE
IPHONE DISCONNECTS AFTER EACH USE AND I HAVE TO RECONNECT TO MAKE OR RECEIVE ANOTHER CALL
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SEEM TO ALWAYS TAKE THE LONGEST ROUTE TO A DESTINATION
DISAPPOINTED WITH THE SYSTEM I CANNOT GET THE WEATHER OR TRAFFIC ON THE SYSTEM INCLUDING APPS AND MESSAGES WHICH ONLY WORKED ONCE ALSO IT S WHAT VEHICLE DOESN T COME WITH A BUILT IN GPS I DON T KNOW IF I DON T HAVE THE TOP OF TH
NAV SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS HORRIBLE AND SPEAKERS ARE OF SUB PAR QUALITY
THE VOICE COMMAND RESPONSE OF MY PHONE
SOUND QUALITY OF MY SPEAKERS
SOUND QUALITY
SOUND DURING PHONE CALLS USING BLUETOOTH
EASIER TO CHANGE SATELLITE STATIONS AND EASIER TO READ SCREEN WITH SUNGLASSES ON
APPARENTLY THE SR5 MODEL DOES NOT GET THE ENTUNES APP FOR THE PHONE
POOR VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PHONE
HD RADIO ALWAYS CUTS IN AND OUT MAKING IT SOUND LIKE THE RADIO IS SKIPPING
RETUNE PLUS NEEDS APP AVAILABILITY IT S POINTLESS WITHOUT IT
VOICE RECOGNITION STINKS
THE TRAFFIC APP IS NOT VERY GOOD OR USEFUL IN FACT IT S PRETTY BAD
THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION AND ENTERTAINMENT IS GOOD BUT I HAVE NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM I ALSO THINK THAT ALL THE NEW VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM
PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENTER DESTINATION WHILE DRIVING
ADDING DESTINATIONS AND DELETING OLD DEST>
SAT RADIO RECEPTION HD RADIO RECEPTION
TOUCH SCREEN IS EASILY DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CAN BE MORE INTUITIVE LESS STEPS TO ENTER A DESTINATION IT SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS ENTERING THE COMPLETE ADDRESS IN ONE STEP
AUDIO CAN BARELY UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING PHONE CALLS ARE RARELY LOUD ENOUGH AND CLEAR ENOUGH PERSON IN OTHER END OFTEN HAS ISSUES HEARING ME
NAV SYSTEM GET RID OF THE NANNY FEATURES I GET SAFETY AND LIABILITY ETC BUT THIS NAV SYSTEM IS A TOTAL FAILURE BY WAY OF EXAMPLE SINCE I CAN T SELECT A LOCATION WHILE IN MOTION I HAVE RESURRECTED MY OLD GARMIN PORTABLE AND NOW USE THAT A
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE WOULD RATHER USE MY PORTABLE
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION
NAVIGATION ISN T ALWAYS CLEAR AND EASY TO USE IT S VERY SENSITIVE AND CAUSES ME TO KEEP CORRECTING THE INPUT
AS INDICATED EARLIER I FOUND NAVIGATION DIFFICULT TO USE FIND USE OF WAZE EASIER
WOULD APPRECIATE MORE POWERFUL SOUND FROM UPGRADED BOSE SYSTEM HAVE TO TURN BLUETOOTH PHONE VOLUME UP TO 50+ TO HEAR CALLS CLEARLY
I AM NOT TECH SAVVY I DON T USE THE EQUIPMENT OFTEN ENOUGH TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH ITS USE
A BETTER FRONT SEAT HOLDER LOCATION THAT DOESN T BLOCK THE USB PORT LOCATION
THE CELL PHONE INTERFACE WHEN CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM
PRESET BUTTONS ON TOUCH SCREEN TOO SMALL SPEAKER QUALITY MEDIOCRE
NOT SURE IF IT S A PROBLEM WITH THE BLUETOOTH OR THE PHONE BUT WHEN PLAYING ITUNES MUSIC NAMES OF BANDS ARE INACCURATE TO WHAT MY PHONE STATES
I WISH IT CAME WITH PANDORA INSTEAD OF HAVING TO PLAY THROUGH MY PHONE
NO RECOMMENDATION IT IS JUST TOO COMPLICATED FOR US OLDER PEOPLE WE PREFER THE OLDER MANUAL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY LEFT US BEHIND
NAVIGATION TO COMPLICATED
MAKE IT EASIER TO SWITCH BETWEEN BLUETOOTH AND CD OR RADIO WHILE DRIVING I DON T WANT TO TAKE MY EYES OFF ROAD AS MUCH IN ORDER TO USE TOUCHSCREEN
I HAVE NOT ADJUSTED TO THE TOUCH SCREEN IF YOU REACH OVER FREQUENTLY IT CHANGES STATIONS
BETTER BLUETOOTH CONNECTION PLAYING MUSIC OR ANSWERING PHONE CALL QUALITY IS VERY POOR
SOUND QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS ARE ONLY MEDIOCRE AT BEST LOWS ARE OKAY BUT MIDS AND HIGHS CAN BE KIND OF DISTORTED TOUCH CONTROLS ARE EASY ENOUGH TO USE BUT TENDS TO HAVE A DELAYED RESPONSE WOULD BE NICE IF THE COLOR SCHEME OF THE DISPLAYS CO
THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD IF I HAD TO CHANGE ONE THING THE LOOK OF THE DISPLAY LOOKS SLIGHTLY DATED IT S NOTHING MAJOR BUT IF I M BEING NITPICKY THAT WOULD BE WHAT I WOULD CHANGE THE SOUND QUALITY IS ADEQUATE BUT CE
I VE HAD FEW COMPLAINTS OF VEHICLE ROAD NOISE COMING THROUGH THE CALL WHEN USING THE INTEGRATED HANDS FREE AND POSSIBLY BETTER GRAPHICS MORE SOURCES AND OR APP INTEGRATION POSSIBILITIES
THE POSITION OF THE USB PORT IS INCONVENIENT
IT COSTS $1 100 TO GET NAVIGATION IN THIS CAR
WHILE ON A CALL THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM IN THE CAR THE OUTSIDE NOISE COULD BE LESS I AM INSIDE THE CAR IF IT IS RAINING THEN THE OTHER PERSON ON THE CALL CAN HEAR THAT ON THE ROOF IF I AM TRAVELING AT A HIGHER SPEED ON THE HIGHWAY THE OT
THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY LOW NOT GOOD FOR CLASSICAL MUSIC LOW DYNAMIC RANGE MAYBE GOOD FOR RAP MUSIC LOTS OF SPEAKERS BUT THEY DON T WORK TOGETHER WELL MISPLACED AND BADLY ADJUSTED FOR CAR S INTERIOR AND SHAPE MY AVALON
MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED IF WE THE CAR S OWNER WOULD RECEIVE SOME KIND OF TRAINING ABOUT THAT
EASIER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP CHOSEN PRESETS INTACT AND TO DELETE OTHERS NEED STEERING WHEEL ADJUSTMENT NOT TO SWITCH PRESETS TO RANDOM SET
BETTER SOUND QUALITY FOR PHONE USE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT WITH NOISE CANCELLATION
BETTER TOUCH SCREEN NOT VERY RESPONSIVE AND WITHOUT NAVIGATION ITS PRETTY MUCH USELESS
SPEAKERS ARE WEAK ALSO MY RADIO DOS NOT OFFER XM SO I HAVE TO PLUG IN AN EXTERNAL RADIO THIS MAKES THE WEAK SPEAKERS EVEN WEAKER
WHEN LISTENING TO FM HD ITS CONSTANTLY SWITCHES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN FM HD AND REGULAR FM BY ITSELF AND CAUSES THE SOUND QUALITY TO SHIFT CONSTANTLY IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT COULD STAY IN ONE SO THAT THE SOUND ISNT CONSTANTLY SWITCHING
I FEEL LIKE NAVAGATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED
WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC THE PICTURES FROM SONGS I HAVE DOWNLOADED DO NOT DISPLAY IT WILL JUST SHOW THE BLUETOOTH OR CD DEFAULT PICTURE THAT IS A HUGE LET DOWN FOR ME THERE ARE ENTIRELY WAY TOO MANY STEPS USING THE HANDS FREE OPTION TO MAKE A
GOOD SOUND QUALITY EASE OF USE OF BUILT IN SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN ALL VEHICLES
THE BLUETOOTH OPTION HAS HAD SOME ISSUES WHERE IT WILL TAKE A WHILE TO CONNECT TO THE PHONE OR MUSIC
I WISH I COULD CONTROL PANDORA THROUGH MY TOUCH SCREEN IN THE PRUIS RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO CONTROL IT THROUGH MY PHONE THE ONLY CONTROLS I DO HAVE ARE VOLUME AND SKIPPING TO THE NEXT SONG
I DID MY RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING MY TOYOTA I ESPECIALLY LIKED THE LARGE TRUNK THE SHELF UNDER THE CONSOLE AND THE GENERAL VISIBILITY FROM INSIDE THE CAR THE GAS MILAGE WAS ALSO A FACTOR IN MY SELECTION IN PURCHASING A TOYOTA PRIUS GOOD FACTORS
WHEN RUNNING MY IPOD THROUGH THE USB PORT I NEED TO TURN THE VOLUME UP QUITE LOUD TO HEAR IT CAUSING A LOSS OF MUSIC QUALITY
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE STANDARD ISSUE TECHNOLOGY IS TOO ADVANCED NOT TO
VOICE RECOGNITION NEVER UNDERSTANDS ME WHEN TRYING TO CALL OUT WHICH IS FRUSTRATING BC I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE A CALL WITHOUT PICKING UP MY PHONE TO DO IT AMERICAN ENGLISH IS MY FIRST LANGUAGE AND I THINK IT SHOULD UNDERSTAND ME
REAR SPEAKERS ARE REALLY BAD AND HAVE NO VOLUME WHEN VOLUME TURNED UP FRONT IS LOUD BUT PEOPLE IN BACK CAN T HEAR THE IN APP NEVER WORKS WHEN PAIRED WITH PHONE I E WEATHER AND TRAFFIC
ENTERING DESTINATION INFORMATION ON THE GPS
VOICE COMMAND OF NAVIGATION COULD BE IMPROVED IN REGARDS TO THE AMOUNT OF MISUNDERSTANDING OF ADDRESSES THAT OCCURS
MAKE THE NAVIGATION MORE ACCURATE AND THE TRAFFIC INFO REAL TIME
VOICE COMMAND FEATURES JUST DOESN T WORK
WE ARE HAVING A LOT OF DIFFICULTY USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT S NOT USER FRIENDLY
LABORIOUS TO TYPE IN ADDRESSES IN CORRECT ORDER VOICE WOULD BE BETTER
SEE PAST COMMENT ABOUT USB PORT
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN AUDIO JACK BECAUSE MY IPOD DOES NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH
VOICE RECOGNITION NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE
IT SEEMS DIFFICULT TO USE VOICE COMMANDS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO USE PUTTING IN INFORMATION
THE LAND CRUISER IS THE ONLY VEHICLE I HAVE HAD IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT HAS CONSTANT DEAD SPOTS WITH THE SATELLITE RADIO
GPS SYSTEM DOESN T WORK
USE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS LIMITED WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A SAFETY RESTRICTION TO KEEP DRIVERS FROM TAKING THEIR EYES OFF THE ROAD BUT IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF THE PASSENGER COULD USE THE SYSTEM REGARDLESS OF
USE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CUMBERSOME AT BEST
VERY HARD TO GET SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO VOISE RECOGNITION ALMOST NEVER UNDERSTANDS REQUEST HAVE TO REPEAT MULTIPLE TIMES AND THEN I DO MANUAL INPUTS
THE TOUCH SCREEN DOES NOT OPERATE CONSISTENTLY ALL OF THE TIME THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS THAT ALLOW THE DRIVER TO ACCESS ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING AND ARE BIT CONFUSING BASICALLY I THINK THERE IS MORE CAPABILITY TO THE SYSTEM THAT I
NAVIGATION IS EXCELLENT
MAKE IT SO THE TOUCH SCREEN WORKS ALL THE TIME
CONSISTENCY IN VOICE RECOGNITION
TOO MUCH EMPHASIS ON BASS TONES HIGH FREQENCIES ARE THIN AND TINNY LACK AMPLITUDE MIDS ARE OVERPOWERING NOT MUCH ADJUSTMENT AVAILABLE FROM THE EQUALIZER
VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
AGAIN VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVING
WORKS GREAT BUT VOICE RECOGNITION IS A PROBLEM
NAV HAS FROZEN A FEW TIMES REQUIRING A RESTART OF THE CAR EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS PER INDUSTRY NORM FOR A MID LEVEL CAR
NAVIGATION TERRIBLE THE AUDIO IS OKAY
MOSTLY TOUCH SCREEN PROBLEM INTERMITTENTLY NOT WORKING
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE VERY SENSITIVE THE SLEEVE OF MY COAT HAS CHANGED THE RADIO STATION MANY TIMES
AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED IT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL TO BE ABLE EASILY TO TEMPORARILY MUTE VOICE DIRECTIONS FROM THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
VOICE ACTIVATED COMMANDS ARE USELESS BECAUSE THEY TAKE TOO LONG TO ACTIVATE AND THE SYSTEM USUALLY DOESN T UNDERSTAND ANYWAY EVEN AFTER ENHANCED TRAINING HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO ACCEPT THE SAMSUNG GALAXY MINIIII PHONE CONTACTS THE DEALER HAS TRIED AT LEAST 3 TIMES AND AT&T HAS TRIED 2 TIMES I EVEN ELIMINATED PHONE CONTACTS THAT WERE QUESTIONABLE ACCORDING TO THE DEALER
FAILURE TO PROPERLY PLAY FROM A USB DRIVE
NEED MORE THAN 1 CD SLOT
THE VOICE ACTIVATED COMMAND DOESN T SEEM TO PICK UP MY VOICE WELL
NOT MUCH TO TELL I HAVE BASIC RADIO CD PLAYER THAT I CAN BLUETOOTH MY PHONE INTO I VE HAD BETTER
THE NAV SYSTEM HAS ISSUES WITH THE ADDRESS PORTION
SPEAKERS COULD BE UPGRADED AS THEY ARE DECENT FOR AM RADIO BUT FM OR CD S ISN T THE BEST QUALITY FOR THE PRICE OF THE CAR
VOICE RECOGNITION SUCKS
MEDIA CONNECTION AND USB PORTS INCLUDED
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK AS WELL AS THE ONE BUILT INTO MY CELL PHONE BUT IN A FAIRNESS I HAVE NOT USED IT EXTENSIVELY IT CUMBERSOME TO ENTER INFORMATION AND OFTEN WON T ALLOW ENTRY OF A KNOWN STREET ADDRESS
IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN IT COMES MAKING PHONE CALLS THERES TOO MANY STEPS TO GO THROUGH BEFORE ACTUALLY MAKING THE CALL FOR EXAMPLE IT WOULD BETTER IF YOU USE THE SAME SYSTEM AS AUDI S SO INSTEAD OF SAY MAKE CALL AND FOR THE MACHINE TO
NAVIGATION TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM COULD BE UPDATED FASTER AND A BIT MORE INTUITIVE I FIND FORD S SYNC TO BE EASIER TO USE HAVE USED IT ON FRIEND S EDGE
CANNOT HAVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON WITHOUT THE MUSIC BEING ON IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO HEAR MUSIC YOU HAVE TO MANUALLY MUTE IT THEY TWO SOUND BE ABLE TO ON OR OFF INDEPENDENTLY
I VE NEVER HAD A BETTER SOUNDING STOCK AUDIO SYSTEM IN A CAR THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WORKS THE LAYOUT WORKS BUT HAS A LEARNING CURVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DISAPPOINTING THE SCREEN RESOLUTION IS VERY POOR THE VOICE AND PICTURE DIRECTION
IT WORKING ALL THE TIME AND THE BACK UP CAMERA TO WORK ALL THE TIME
THE CD PLAYER CANNOT BE UTILIZES WHILE DRIVING
MUSIC INTEGRATION WITH THE IPHONE OR ANDROID I AM UNABLE TO PLAY MUSIC USING THE ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLE IN MY CAR I VE TRIED CONNECTING USING THE PROPRIETARY CABLE AND USB TO NO AVAIL IT DOESN T WORK MY WISH IS TO PLAY MUSIC FROM MY SPOTIFY ACC
GET RID OF THE TOUCH SCREEN NOT ACCURATE TO TOUCH DOES NOT WORK IN GLOVES IN THE WINTER
THE GRAPHICS ON THE ENTERTAINMENT SCREEN ARE AWFUL FOR A VEHICLE THE DOT PITCH IS UNACCEPTABLE AT THIS PRICE POINT PLUS NO APPS PANDORA YOU GET THESE APPS WITH VEHICLES COSTING MUCH LESS VERY DISAPPOINTED HERE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM COULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED THROUGH MANY ASPECTS HER PROMPTS COULD BE SHORTENED AND YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OVERRIDE HER IF YOU HAVE THE COMMAND MEMORIZED
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT AS USER FRIENDLY AS OTHER MODELS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE GOOGLE MAPS ADDED TO THE GTI
THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR ENTERING DESTINATION   ADDRESS SHOULD BE ADJUSTED TO ALLOW DRIVER TO SPEAK AN ENTIRE STREET ADDRESS RATHER THAN VERY SLOW CITY STREET HOUSE NUMBER
IPOD INTEGRATION AND OVERALL FLEXIBILITY IS GOOD I PURCHASED A VEHICLE BECAUSE I WANTED RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION NOT A MOBILE INTERNET CAFE THERE ARE TOO MANY DISTRACTED OR IMPAIRED DRIVERS ON THE ROAD ALREADY
BETTER NAVIGATION ADD A USB PORT ADD HEAD UP DISPLAY
THE RESPONSE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IS TOO SLOW I DON T LIKE THE VOICE ACTIVATION SYSTEM
LOVE THE BOSE AUDIO
CLARITY OF BLUETOOTH CALLS COULD BE CLEARER NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDED
VOLKSWAGEN SHOULD COME UP WITH AN AFTERMARKET SOLUTION TO UPDATE THE SYSTEM WITH APPLE S CARPLAY IMMEDIATELY
WE HAVE TWO DRIVERS IN OUR HOUSEHOLD OFTEN TIMES WE AREN T SURE WHOSE IPHONE IS BEING ACCESSED WHEN WE ARE BOTH IN THE CAR SECONDLY WE DON T LIKE THAT IT AUTOMATICALLY STARTS PLAYING MUSIC OFF OF ONE OF THE PHONES WHEN WE GET IN AND WE RE NOT
BETTER BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WHEN CONNECTED TO MY PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH SONG INFORMATION DOESN T ALWAYS DISPLAY
TWO THINGS THERE ARE STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS TO CYCLE THROUGH AUDIO FAVORITES BUT THEY ONLY CYCLE WITHIN A BAND SO YOU CAN T SWITCH BETWEEN AN FM FAVORITE AND A SATELLITE FAVORITE WITHOUT RESORTING TO THE TOUCHSCREEN TRAFFIC ALERTS E G WR
NAV SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE EASIER TO USE
AUDIO IS GREAT HOWEVER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOOKS CONFUSING I USE THE APP WAZE ON MY CELL PHONE FOR CLARITY TO MAKE SURE MY EYES ARE FOCUSED ON THE ROAD I ABSOLUTELY HATE THE ROAD ALERT AND THE NOISE THOSE ALERTS DO THOSE ALERTS ARE SOMETIMES
I DON T HAVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN MY VEHICLE BUT I LOVE THE HANDS FREE VOICE SYSTEM IT MAKES TAKING TO MY CLIENTS EASY AND STRESS FREE
EXPECTED BETTER SCREEN QUALITY AND ALSO CONTROL MECHANISM FOR SELECTIONS THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT CONVENIENT WHEN DRIVING AND IS A DISTRACTION
THE VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE MUCH BETTER
NAVIGATION BY DIRECTIONS REQUIRES ENTERING A STREET ADDRESS ENTERING ONLY A CITY AND STATE IS NOT ALLOWED NAVIGATION SHOULD ALLOW DIRECTIONAL NAVIGATION TO A CITY CENTER WITHOUT USING A STREET ADDRESS
SNAIL LIKE ACCEPTANCE OF COMMANDS ON TOUCH SCREEN MENU BACK UP CAMERA SLOW TO COME AND SLOW TO TURN OFF
EASIER TO PROGRAM NAVIGATION SYSTEM
PROBLEMS WITH BLUETOOTH WHEN USING SMART PHONE TO NAVIGATE OR PLAY MUSIC
KEYBOARD EASE WHEN TYPING IN ADDRESSES ETC IT S FUNKY
AS FAR AS I M CONCERNED AS THE DRIVER LESS SIMPLICITY OF CHOICE AND OPERATION IS MORE WHERE COMMUNICATION IS CONCERNED I LOVE THE WAY IT AUTOMATICALLY ENGAGES MY WIFE S IPHONE WITH ALL IT S FEATURES AS FAR AS SATELLITE OFFERINGS THEY SHOULD
COMMUNICATION USE STANDARD BUTTONS AND COMMANDS EXAMPLE TOYOTA S NAVIGATION REDESIGN LEARN FROM MARKET LEADERS SUCH AS GARMIN NO NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL
OUT DATE TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM TAKES TO LONG TO BOOT FROM COLD START TRAFFIC MAPS ARE TOO CLUTTERED WITH TRAFFIC NOT ON ROADS IN ROUTE WHILE NAVIGATING
WHEN USING THE CELL PHONE TO TALK THROUGH THE CAR THE OTHER PERSON ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE CAN NOT HEAR ME AS CLEARLY
SOMETIMES THE PERSON I AM SPEAKING TO ON THE TELEPHONE HANDS FREE THROUGH THE VEHICLE S SYSTEM HAS TROUBLE HEARING ME CLEARLY CORRECTLY
WHEN USING BLUETOOTH FUNCTION TO PLAY MUSIC IT SHOULD DISPLAY THE ARTIST SONG AND ALBUM INFO
THE CONTROLS WHEN MEDIA DEVICES ARE CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH AUDIO HAVE A LONG DELAY THIS WILL SOMETIMES RESULT IN EITHER SKIPPING THE DESIRED SONG PRESSING MULTIPLE TIMES OR REWINDING TO THE BEGINNING OF A SONG WHEN I INTENDED TO GO BACK ONE
PROVIDE A USB PORT FOR PHONE PLUG IN
SOUND QUALITY FOR BLUETOOTH
MORE RESPONSIVE NAV SYSTEM IT IS SLOW TO RESPOND
THE SOUND OF THE HANDS FREE PHONE AND ALSO THE AM FM RADIO WHICH IS JUST PLAIN POOR QUALITY
SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER
INTERNET CONNECTION AND TEXTING
WIRELESS SPEAKER FOR HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS I WORK ON THE ROAD QUITE A BIT AND EVERYONE HAS COMPLAINED THAT THEY CAN T HEAR ME OR IT S VERY CHOPPY AND SOUNDS FAR AWAY
THE SOUND QUALITY MAKES ME REGRET BUYING THE VEHICLE
USB AND MEMORY CARDS ARE IN GLOVE BOX AND A IT HARD TO GET TO AS THE DRIVER
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT AND VERY EASY TO USE
BETTER SOUND QUALITY
AGAIN EASIER TO USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LIKE A GARMIN
AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK WHEN USING MY IPHONE THRU BLUETOOTH WHEN I AM JUST STARTING TO LEAVE A VOICEMAIL MESSAGE IT SAYS MESSAGE DELETED PLEASE RE RECORD AND THEN MAKES ME START MY MESSAGE OVER THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED WITH MY IPHONE EXCEPT WHE
NO NAVIGATION OR WEATHER APPS INTERNET
VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD RECOGNIZE NAMES IN SPANISH
HANDS FREE PHONE USE HARD TO CONNECT HARD TO HEAR DROPS CALLS VERY ANNOYING HAVE GIVEN UP TRYING TO USE IT AT ALL
EVERY TIGUAN SHOULD HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUILT IN
HARD TO TYPE IN ADDRESSES IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOICE ACTUATED WOULD BE NICE
CALLERS SAY THEY SOMETIMES CAN NOT UNDERSTAND ME WHEN TALKING BUT I AM HEARING THEM CLEARLY MICROPHONE COULD BE BETTER
VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY CONFUSING
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN A LOT OF CONNECTIVITY IN MY CAR MOST OF IT IS WASTED ON ME
PHONE CALL VOLUME IS RELATIVELY LOW
THE NAV SYSTEM DOES NOT PROVIDE TEXT THE NAME OF THE STREET YOU RE ON NOR THE TOWNSHIP YOU RE IN IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IF THE DIRECTION OF THE NEXT TURN IS PROVIDED SOONER EVEN BETTER IF THE NEXT TWO TURNS DISTANCE AND DIRECTION WAS DISPLAYED
COULD BE ABLE TO CHANGE COLORS OF TOUCH SCREEN
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO PHONE NEEDS IMPROVMENT OFTEN TAKES SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO WORK AND ALL FUNCTIONS DONT ALWAYS WORK FF AND RWD ETC
BIGGER SCREEN FOR THE NAV SYSTEM AND ABILITY TO GO DOWN TO LESS THAN 1 16 OF A MILE RESOLUTION
BLUETOOTH SOUND MUSIC CHOICE SELECTION DIAL AND SETUP
INTERNET AND APPLICATION CONNECTIVITY VERY SLOW
A BIT COMPLICATED AND THE THING I USE THE MOST PHONE VIA VOICE DIALING IS FAIRLY KLUDGY CONNECTIVITY WITH BLUETOOTH IS LESS RELIABLE THAN IT SHOULD BE
SOMETIMES CONFUSING MOVING BETWEEN DIFFERENT SYSTEMS WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE TOUCH SCREEN CAPABILITY
VOLUME NOT LOAD ENOUGH ON NAVIGATION
UNBELIEVABLY WHEN I SET NAVIGATION TO MY HOME ADDRESS IT GIVES WRONG INSTRUCTIONS INTO A NON EXISTANT STREET ABOUT ONE MILE FROM MY HOUSE
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN IT IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE OTHER PARTY ON THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM THE AUDIO IS DIFFICULT TO ADJUST TO THE RIGHT LEVEL TO BE ABLE TO HEAR
PROGRAMMING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY CUMBERSOME
VOICE RECOGNITION IS SO TIMES DIFFICULT EVEN AFTER TRAINING
GOOD SOUND QUALITY EASE OF SETTING STATIONS REAR VIEW MIRROR DISPLAY OF DRIVING DIRECTION N E S W ETC HELPFUL
NONE OF THE SYSTEMS ARE VERY EASY TO USE AND THERE ARE TOO MANY STEPS TO ACCOMPLISH THINGS CONNECT BLUETOOTH SEE NEXT NAVIGATION STEPS ETC
I HAVE FOUND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO USE NOT USER FRIENDLY I JUST USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON MY IPHONE INSTEAD
HAS A HARD TIME CONNECTING TO THE INTERNET APPS SOMETIMES CAN T CONNECT AT ALL EVEN IN CITIES WHERE WE HAVE GOOD RECEPTION
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM WOULD RESPOND WHEN I GIVE IT NAVIGATION COMMANDS ALSO SOME CLEAR EXPLANATION OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL WHEN I PICKED UP THE VEHICLE I M HOPING I LL GET THE HELP I NEED WH
SETTING A DESTINATION CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND CONFUSING FOR EXAMPLE IF AN ADDRESS IS LOCATED JUST OUTSIDE OF CITY LIMITS THE SYSTEM WON T LIST IT UNLESS YOU BACK UP THE PROMPTS AND CHANGE TO THE COUNTY NAME WHICH YOU MAY NOT RECOGNIZE
IMPROVE THE SETUP OF NAVIGATION SYS
KEYBOARD FOR ENTRY
THE MAP SYSTEM LOOKS MUCH MORE PRIMITIVE THAN SAY GOOGLE MAPS
THE CONNECTION TO THE CAR S AUX IS QUITE DIFFICULT OF A BLUETOOTH POSSIBLE CONNECTION IS DETECTED IN THE CAR THE CAR WANTS TO USE THE MEDIA CORD INSTEAD OF THE AUX CORD AND THAT IS NOT ALWAYS A VIABLE OPTION AND THE DISPLAY BUTTONS DO NO
GREAT CONCEPTS BUT WITHOUT CONNECTIVITY THE APPLICATIONS ARE WORTHLESS
DISPLAY IS PRETTY BLAND LOOKING COMPARED TO OTHER MAKES IN THE SAME CAR CLASS LACKS COLOR AND A LOT OF INFORMATION ON THE CENTER DASH PANEL COULD ALSO BE DISPLAYED ON THE TOUCH SCREEN
NAV SYSTEM NON OP DURING MOVEMENT PASSENGER UNABLE TO USE
NO USB FOR PHONE OR IPOD TABLET A JOKE
POOR SOUND QUALITY WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH FOR THE PHONE ALL YOU HEAR IS ECHOING
CD PLAYER IS NOT IN A CONVENIENT PLACE AND IS NOT EASY TO OPERATE NAV SYSTEM SET UP IS NOT INTUITIVE
ALLOW MIRRORING OF CELL PHONE SCREEN TO NAV SCREEN SO THAT 3RD PARTY APPS LIKE WAZE CAN BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NAV SYSTEM TO REPORT TRAFFIC INCIDENTS POLICE CARS ETC
MORE VOICE DIRECTION FROM NAVIGATION SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH REQUIRES MULTIPLE REPEATS
SOMETIMES HAVE ISSUES WITH BLUETOOTH USING IPHONE PANDORA APP IT DOESN T ALWAYS WORK
THERE IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION BEING SHOWN ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN AT A QUICK GLANCE YOU SHOULD ONLY NEED TO SEE THE ACTUAL MAP AND NOT A SIDE LINK OF EXITS AND ROUTE NUMBERS TOO DISTRACTING
DIFFICULT TO LOCATE HIGHWAYS NAMED WITH JUST A NUMBER   VOICE RECOGNITION NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE
WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH FOR THE PHONE THE VOLUME IS TOO LOW EVEN WHEN IT IS ALL THE WAY UP
PROVIDE PAPER INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM THIS PART OF THE DRIVER S MANUAL IS AVAILABLE ONLY ON LINE IN THE VEHICLE I STRUGGLED ALOT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE IPOD NAGIVATE BETWEEN FM RADIO & SIRIUS ETC AS I DIDN T KNOW WHAT
I USE THE CONNECTED IPHONE TO CONDUCT 90% OF MY BUSINESS I SORT OF WISH THERE WAS AN OPTION TO DELETE THESE FACTORY SYSTEMS AND JUST USE THE PHONE FOR NAVIGATION ALTERNATE AUDIO SOURCES PHONE ETC LET THE CAR PROVIDE BIG SCREEN MICROPHONE A
TAKES AWHILE TO CONNECT TO INTERNET FOR PANDORA AT TIMES MUSIC STOPS WAITING FOR SIGNAL
AN ANNOYING THING IS THAT I CANNOT CHANGE THE RADIO STATION OR USE THE AUDIO SYSTEM AT ALL WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN REVERSE IT IS AS IF THE BACK UP CAMERA TAKES OVER THE SYSTEM ALSO A FEATURE THAT I REALLY DO NOT LIKE IS THAT YOU CANNOT SEE INF
TOUCH SCREEN
SWITCHING FROM AM TO FM OR SAT IS MOST INCONVENIENT I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED
THE INTERFACE IS ODD AND DODGY TOO MUCH BS TO MOVE FROM AUDIO TO NAV
3D NAV MAPS COULD USE MORE DETAIL
TO GIVE MULTI ROUTING CHOICES
TOUCH SCREEN INTERNET CONNECTIVITY MOBILE APP FOR VEHICLE
SETTING UP FEATURES REQUIRES NAVIGATION THRU MULTIPLE MENUS
THE DATA MODEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN 4G LTE AND NOT 3G IN THAT IS A REAL JOKE THE APPS TAKE FOREVER TO LOAD WHY WOULD I EVEN USE THEM
CONNECTION IS VERY SLOW FOR THE INTERNET APPS AND HALF THE TIME THEY DO NOT LOAD IT IS ALSO A COMPLICATED SYSTEM
MAKE NAVIGATION SYSTEM EASIER TO USE GET AWAY FROM DIAL SCROLL FEATURE AND REPLACE WITH KEYBOARD
VOICE RECOGNITION INFORMATION ON HOW TO USE MANUAL
RADIO STATION LOCATING IS SOMEWHAT AWKWARD NAVIGATION SYSTEM REQUIRES TOWN CITY FOR POINT OF INTEREST WOULD BE BETTER BY DISTANCE FROM POSITION OF CAR
EASE OF USE OF TELEPHONE MANUAL NUMBERS ARE TOO LOW AND REQUIRE YOU TAKE EYES OFF ROAD WHEN USING BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IS IFFY
I DON T HAVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND NO REAL PROBLEMS WILL ANY OF THE OTHER SYSTEMS
PROVIDE AN EASY WAY TO PAUSE NAVIGATION
DISPLAY IS TOO SMALL AND THE ON SCREEN CONTROLS AND SETTINGS ARE HARD TO NAVIGATE
I CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING THE VOICE ACTIVATED SYSTEMS TO WORK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE HAD A LITTLE MORE INSTRUCTION FROM THE DEALER REGARDING THE USE OF THE HANDS FREE SYSTEMS
LIKE ALL MODERN TECH HEAVY PRODUCTS EASE OF USE IS AN ISSUE
ENTRY OF NAVIGATION DATA
I HAVE ALREADY DESCRIBED THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY PROBLEM FORCING PHONE TO KEEP PLAYING NON REGARDING THE DRIVER S COMMANDS THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND IS A WORST PART OF MY NEW VEHICLE
VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD PERMIT ASKING FOR A PRESET LIKE PRESET 1 AFTER BEING SWITCHED TO FM RADIO IT PERMITS ASKING FOR A RADIO FREQUENCY BUT I DON T SEE HOW TO ASK FOR A PRESET SAME IS TRUE WITH SIRIUS AS I DON T SEE A WAY TO REQUEST FOR
IT S FINE ALTHOUGH VOICE ACTIVATED DIRECTIONS WOULD BE BETTER
USED TO HAVE THE MARK LEVINSON SYSTEM HARD TO BEAT THAT I DON T REALLY USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MUCH OTHER PEOPLE LIKE TO PROGRAM IT THOUGH
ENTIRE SYSTEM IS SLOW & A BIT TEDIOUS TO PROGRAM OR CHANGE RADIO STATIONS
IMPROVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IN GENERAL
TOUCH PAD TAKES A STEADY HAND AND I M A DENTAL HYGIENIST WOULD A DIAL BE EASIER TO CONTROL
MARK LEVINSON SOUND SYSTEM IS AMAZING
NO NAVIGATION UNIT TO HOOK UP TOO MUNCH THE MONEY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM HARDWARE DECK SCREEN IS PREINSTALLED FROM FACTORY HOWEVER CUSTOMER MUST PAY $1600 TO HAVE THE SOFTWARE ACTIVATED WE HAVE NOT PAID THE $1600 ON OUR SCION SO WE DO NOT KNOW ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE NAVIGATION
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WAS SOMEWHAT RELIABLE THE AUDIO IS FINE EXCEPT THE TOUCH SCREEN IS INTERMITTENT
TWEEKING THE VOICE COMMAND FOR THE SYSTEM AT TIMES I JUST GIVE UP DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY IN RECOGNITION
BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTION IS NOT GREAT RECIPIENT OF MY CALLS HEARS LOTS OF BACKGROUND NOISE EVEN THOUGH MY RIDE IS VERY QUIET THE SCREEN FOR THE RADIO THAT CONTAINS YOUR PRESET FAVORITE CHANNELS DOES NOT WORK QUITE RIGHT WHEN YOU TURN THE
WHEN USING BLUETOOTH CONNECTION ON PHONE IPOD CANNOT CONTROL MUSIC SELECTIONS THROUGH SCREEN CAN ONLY USE DEVICE TO SELECT MUSIC
APPS POOR AND DIFFICULT TO ACCESS
GENERALLY A GOOD SYSTEM BUT VOICE RECOGNITION IS VER SLOW AND OVERALL REACTION EVEN WHEN NOT USING VOICE RECOGNITION IS SLOW
ABILITY TO NAVIGATE SYSTEM VIA BUTTONS ON STEERING WHEEL OR MOUSE LIKE DEVICE ON CONSOLE IT S TOO DANGEROUS TO USE TOUCHSCREEN AND I HAVE NOT GOTTEN USED TO VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM YET
NEEDS STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS NEEDS VOICE CONTROLS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS SOME SERIOUS IMPROVEMENTS
I M JUST NOT THAT TECH SAVVY SO DO NOT UTILIZE ALL THE CAPABILITIES WHEN IN THE VEHICLE
VOICE RECOGNITION ABILITY TO CONNECT TO APPS THROUGH ENTUNE
I REALLY MISS THE INTERNAL HARD DRIVE THAT WAS IN MY PREVIOUS INFINITI
CONNECTIVITY OF IPHONE 6 FOR USING PANDORA OR OTHER APPS
PLEASE MAKE THE CONTROLS OF DVD PLAYER EASIER TO CONTROL FROM DRIVER SEAT MOST DVD HAVE A MAIN MENU AND IT HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHICH FUNCTION TO PUSH TO START THE MOVIE NAVIGATION STINKS AT RECOGNIZING VOICE COMMAND FOR NEW DESTINATION ALWAYS
THERE ARE A LOT OF STEPS TO VOICE CALLING AND ENTERING IN AN ADDRESS FOR NAVIGATION
JD POWER YOU SHOULD NOT LIMIT THE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOX THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE SYSTEM IS THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR ENTERING NAVIGATION INFO
THE JAGUAR CONNECTIVITY APPS NEED A SUBSCRIPTION WHEN PURCHASING A 70K + VEHICLE I WOULD ASSUME THAT FEATURES LIKE THIS WOULD BE INCLUDED
COVER ART VIA SPOTIFY
EASE OF ADDRESS ENTRY AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM S ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE AN ADDRESS WITHOUT STARTING OVER
SOUND SYSTEM IS OVERALL POOR PLEASE LOOK AT GOOGLE MAPS FOR TIPS ON EASE OF USE AND CLARITY OF DIRECTIONS
BLUETOOTH MIC SHOULD BE PUT CLOSER TO THE DRIVER SO IT ACTUALLY WORKS
NAV IS VERY UNFRIENDLY AND CONFUSING INPUT  CORRECTION DISLIKE IT
BLUETOOTH IS VERY DIFFICULT TO HEAR
CHARGER FOR IPHONE NEW VERSIONS
WE ALSO HAVE A GPS SYSTEM THAT PLUGS INTO LIGHTER AND PROVIDES MORE VARIETY OF USES FOR EXAMPLE ON THE PORTABLE GPS WE CAN LOOK FOR RESTAURANTS BY TYPE CAN T DO THAT ON VW SYSTEM
THE FASTER YOU DRIVE OTHER PEOPLE CAN NOT HER YOU ON THE BLUETOOTH SO ON THE HIGHWAY IT S A NO GO THEY CAN T HEAR YOU
NO NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AUDIO IS OK THOUGH
GRAPHICS OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE IMPROVED
I REALLY DO DISLIKE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND I HAVEN T BOTHERED TO SPEND MUCH TIME EXPLORING IT IT SHOULD BE VERY INTUITIVE BUT I DON T FEEL IT IS MAYBE I AM SPOILED BUT EVEN MY 8 YEAR OLD GARMEN IS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND AND GET INFO OUT OF
BOSE SPEAKERS
VOICE CONTROLLED RADIO VOICE CONTROLLED NAVIGATION SYSTEM
SELECTOR WHEEL INTERFACE CUMBERSOME NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS BARELY ACCEPTABLE LACKS DETAIL FLEXIBLE DATA ENTRY
MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE A USB DRIVE HENCE CANNOT USE PEN DRIVES TO LISTEN TO MUSIC
BETTER INFORMATION ON USING VOICE RECOGNITION FOR ALL APPLICATIONS
VOICE RECOGNITION IS LACKING I HAVE NOT TRIED HARD TO RESOLVE AS I DON T FIND IT WORTH MY EFFORT TO DEAL WITH
AWFUL SOUND QUALITY FOR PHONE RARELY USE HANDS FREE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ME CLEARLY THEY SAY IT ECHOS
PROBABLY NOTHING AT THIS TIME I HAVEN T FIGURED OUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET
PEOPLE TELL ME THERE S AN ECHO WHEN I SPEAK VIA BLUETOOTH
SATTELITE RADEIO NOT AVAILABLE
IT IS ANNOYING THAT VIA BLUETOOTH YOU CANNOT CONTROL THE MUSIC ON THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS BUT YOU CAN WHEN YOU HAVE IT PLUGGED IN VIA USB PORT
THE VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED MUUUCH MORE I TRULY HAVE A VERY HARD TIME USING IT IT IS VERY COMPLICATED AND VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM MAKES IT SO MUCH HARDER
MAKE IT COMPATIBLE WITH ANY MAKE NOT JUST APPLE PRODUCTS ENABLE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL WITH BLUETOOTH FOR ALL AUDIO FUNCTIONS INSTALL USB PORTS IN A MORE CONVENIENT LOCATION
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE SERIOUSLY IMPROVED UPON EVEN THE IPHONE S MAP FEATURES AND GPS ABILITIES ARE BETTER THAN THIS NAV SYSTEM MAYBE USING A GARMIN SYSTEM OR PAIRING UP WITH A LARGER COMPANY WOULD BE BETTER BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE SIMPL
THE SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER
IMPROVE ON THE AUDIO SOUND SYSTEM BY OFFERING A SUPERIOR SYSTEM MORE WATTAGE AND SPEAKERS AS AN OPTION JUST LIKE THE SYSTEM PROVIDED ON THEIR TOP OF THE LINE V6 AWD MODEL
WHEN USING HANDS FREE PHONE OPTION PERSON ON OTHER END OF CALL HEARS AN ECHO OF THE CONVERSATION
THE VOICE ACTIVATION DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ME I HAVE YET TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE CAPABILITIES OF THE SYSTEM BUT I LOVE THE BLUETOOTH THOUGH IT SOMETIMES DISCONNECTS
I DON T LIKE DISPLAY OR EASE OF USE OF NAVIGATION VOICE ACTIVATION USE I MAY JUST NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT MORE EFFECTIVELY
THE BLUETOOTH IS CONSTANTLY NOT WORKING PROPERLY IT IS HARD TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND MAKE PHONE CALLS MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF THE TIME THESE ISSUES HAPPEN WHEN I AM DRIVING AND PARKED
NOT EASY TO PLAY CDS OR DETERMINE HOW TO LOAD MORE THAN ONE MY TWO PREVIOUSLY OWNED CC HAD FRONT LOADING DEVICES THAT MADE THE MEDIA SYSTEM EASIER TO OPERATE
WHEN USING THE VEHICLES TOUCH SCREEN I FIND MYSELF TOUCHING THE SCREEN MORE OFTEN IN PRIOR GENERATIONS IT WAS QUICKER USING THE RADIO BUTTONS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS THE PITS THE OTHER SYSTEMS ARE VERY GOOD
I HAVEN T REALLY USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BECAUSE IT LOOKS CONFUSING AND I HAVEN T HAD THE TIME TO LEARN IT
TOUCHSCREEN SYSTEM IS WAY TOO DIFFICULT TO USE I TRULY HATE IT IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME WISH I HADN T LEASED THIS CAR
SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC DIRECTLY OVER BLUETOOTH WITHOUT CONNECTING
RATING IS NOT BECAUSE IT IS A NISSAN JUKE NO CAR OR TRUCK I HAVE HAD HAS DONE AN ABOVE AVERAGE JOB OF BLUETOOTH CELL PHONE USE THE JUKE S IS AS GOOD OR BETTER THAN ANY OTHERS I HAVE USED PROBABLY 15
FULL FUNCTIONALITY ON THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
THE VOICE COMMANDS ARE USUALLY HIT OR MISS ALSO THE ONLY WAY TO GET TRAFFIC UPDATES OR WEATHER UPDATES IS THROUGH SIRIUS XM IT WOULD BE BETTER IF I COULD GET THOSE DIRECTLY THROUGH THE NISSAN CONNECT APP OR ALLOW A PASS THROUGH ONTO THE SCREE
THE PHONE SYSTEM HAS TOO MANY STEPS CAN NOT SEEM TO SAY JUST CALL AND GIVE NUMBER AND IT WILL NOT GO TO RIGHT NAME IN MY CONTCT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE IF THERE IS NO KNOWN NUMBER ON A STREET SOMETIMES HAVE JUST STREET NAME SO WANT TO GET TO THE AREA IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF IT WOULD FIND THE STREET EVEN IF THE EXACT HOUSE NUMBER IS NOT KNOWN
MORE WORK NEEDED ON NAV SYSTEM NOT ENOUGH INFO AVAILABLE AND NEEDS TIED TO GAS TANK I AM USE TO WHEN THE TANK IS LOW GAS STATIONS ARE SHOWN ON MAP AUTOMATICALLY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ABSENT NOT OFFERED IN SV COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MY CELL PHONE MY CHOICE MAKE CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL LESS DOMINANT THEY GET IN THE WAY OF OPERATING THE VEHICLE
VOICE COMMANDS
IT S DIFFICULT FOR THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END TO HEAR ME WHEN MAKING HANDS FREE CALL I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I M HAVING TO YELL AT THEM
NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS COME TO LATE WHILE USING MAPQUEST AT SAME TIME IT GIVES TURN BY TURN DIRECTIONS IN ADVANCE NEED ALSO DOESN T ALWAYS RESPOND TO MY VERBAL COMMANDS
THE EASE OF USING AND UNDERSTANDING THE APPS
SOUND QUALITY IS POOR MUSIC SOUNDS BAD AS THE AUDIO SOUND INCREASES
BETTER QUALITY FOR EVERYTHING IT IS A NEW ERA OF TECHNOLOGY AND IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE S USE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPOSE AND SEND TEXT MESSAGES FOR IPHONES USING VOICE COMMANDS
THE APP WILL NOT CONNECT OTHERS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM
FIX THE OBVIOUS MICROPHONE ISSUE IMPROVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IN GENERAL TOO MANY STEPS TO DO THINGS AND LET ME USE THE FRIGGIN NAVIGATION INPUT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING DO THAT AND IT D BE A 10 10
VOICE CONTROL FOR RADIO WOULD BE GREAT
NEVER USE NAV USE MY IPHONE STOPPED USING VOICE RECOGNITION TOO MANY ERRORS
REPLACE THE ENTIRE UNIT WITH ONE THAT FEATURES ANDROID AUTO AND APPLE CARPLAY
COMPATIBILITY WITH IPOHNE 6 AND IPAD AIR 2
NEED APP SUPPORT SIMILAR TO WHAT DODGE PROVIDES
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE NAVIGATION DOESN T ALWAYS WORK HAS A HARD TIME WITH A FULL ADDRESS GETTING THE RIGHT LOCATION
BAD ADJUST ABILITY AND LOCATION AND THE VOICE COMMAND HAS ALLOT OF PROBLEMS RECOGNIZING COMMANDS AND WHATS HAS BEEN SAID
IT TAKES QUIET A BIT OF TIME FOR IT TO READ MY IPOD MAYBE CLOSE TO A MINUET THEN WHEN I TELL IT TO SHUFFLE THE SONGS IT HAS THE SAME SHUFFLES ORDER EVERY TIME NOT A FAN OF BOTH THINGS
NAVIGATION SOFTWARE NEEDS TO BE MADE MORE USER FRIENDLY
FIND A RADIO THAT CAN UPLOAD APPLE PRODUCTS FASTER AND KEEP THEM IN MEMORY IT TAKES MY RADIO WAY TOO LONG TO READ MY IPOD I WILL BE HALFWAY TO MY DESTINATION BY THE TIME MY MUSIC COMES ON I USE MY IPOD ALL THE TIME AND THATS A BIG PROBLEM FOR M
IT SIMPLY DOESN T HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH ANYTHING IT PLAIN AND SIMPLY SUCKS CAN T PLAY MUSIC FROM MY IPHONE CAN T ANSWER CALLS IT JUST DON T WORK
THE LOGIC USED TO CONNECT AND PLAY FROM A USB CONNECTED DEVICE CORRECT IT SO THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE SAME SONG EVERY TIME I TURN ON THE AUDIO SYSTEM THE SYNC SYSTEM IN MY FORD WORKS MUCH BETTER IN THIS ASPECT THE WAY IT IS NOW
BETTER CLARITY FOR VOICE RECOGNITION AND BETTER QUALITY SPEAKERS IN THE VEHICLE
WHEN CONNECTING IPHONE VIA BLUETOOTH IT CAN TAKE UP TO 30 40 SECONDS TO DOWNLOAD PHONE CONTACTS TO ME THAT SEEMS TOO LONG AS I DON T HAVE MORE THAN 30 CONTACTS OR SO THE SYSTEM IS UNABLE TO PLAY MUSIC DURING THAT TIME
THE TOUCH SCREEN RADIO SCREEN NEEDS TO BE LARGER
REPLACE TOM TOM NAVIGATION WITH GARMIN THEIR MAPS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER
VOICE RECOGNITION AND CONNECTIVITY ARE HORRIBLE
UNINTUITIVE VOICE COMMANDS
SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING ME THROUGH THE HANDS FREE AUDIO BUT OVERALL IT WORKS GREAT
THE PLACE FOR VOICE RECOGNITION LOWER IN THE CAR THAN THE CEILING LIGHT
STEREO IT S OKAY BUT SPEAKERS COULD BE A LITTLE HIGHER END AND RADIO DISPLAY COULD BE A LITTLE CLEANER
VOICE RECOGNITION ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY POOR
THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE SIMPLY DOES NOT WORK WELL
I USE NAVIGATION ON MY PHONE BUT THE ONLY TIME IT CONNECTS THROUGH THE VEHICLE IS WHEN I USE PANDORA
SIRIUS RADIO ANTENNA NEEDS UPGRADE SIGNAL GOES OUT TOO OFTEN
SATELLITE RADIO CUTS OUT IN COMMERCIAL AREAS
HAVE LIMITED USE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
USING BLUETOOTH TO MAKE PHONE CALLS IS CLUNKY WOULD NICE TO BE ABLE TO USE ONE STEP COMMANDS TO CALL SOMEONE EG CALL XX MOBILE AND YOU JUST GET CONNECTED OCCASIONALLY THE RADIO JUMPS BETWEEN HD1 AND HD2 I HAVE NO IDEA HOW OR WHY THIS HAPP
VERY PLEASED WITH AUDIO SYSTEM ONE ISSUE HOWEVER IS WHEN PLAYING IPOD IT DOES NOT START FROM WHERE IT WAS LAST PLAYING SPECIFICALLY IT FORGETS THE SONG TRACK THAT WAS ON AND ALWAYS STARTS FROM THE EXACT SAME SONG OVER AND OVER VERY ANNOYING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS USELESS IN TRAFFIC
VOICE RECOGNITION HAS NOT RECOGNIZED MY REQUEST A COUPLE OF TIMES ALSO IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN TO PLUG IN DEVICES BEFORE TAKING OFF IT IS DIFFICULT TO PLUG IN WHILE ON THE ROAD
THE BOSE SYSTEM IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE
AGAIN THE SCREEN IS TOO SMALL FOR A NEW HIGH TRIM LEVEL VEHICLE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS UPDATED AS WELL THE DISPLAYING AND READING OF TEXT MESSAGES COULD USE SOME STREAMLINING
NAVIGATION VOICE CONTROL
SEE PREVIOUS COMMENT ABOUT LOADING MUSIC PLAYLISTS
GOT USE TO USE IPAD FOR NAVIGATION SO I DO NOT LIKE TOMTOM
TAKES TOO LONG TO MAKE A CALL BLUETOOTH CHANGES SETTINGS ON ITS OWN RADIO TOUCHSCREEN STAYS DIRTY
PREFER GARMIN LOGIC AS TOM TOM OFTEN GIVES POOR ROUTING AND GIVES ME LOCATIONS THAT ARE OUT OF DATE
WHEN USING THE USB TO PLAY MP3 MUSIC THE SYSTEM ALWAYS PLAY THE FIRST TRACK EACH TIME THE VEHICLE STARTS WOULD MUCH PREFER IT TO SIMPLY CONTINUE WITH THE SONG IT WAS PLAYING WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS SHUT OFF TIRED OF HAVING TO CHANCE THE SELECTIO
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CAN T BE UPDATED AT ALL WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION OF COURSE THIS IS A COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE SAFETY FEATURE BUT IT S NOT CONVENIENT
THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THE VEHICLE TAKES TO RECOGNIZE A BLUETOOTH DEVICE
IPOD CONNECTION IS USELESS I HAVE IPHONE AND IT DOES NOT WORK EVER
THERE IS TOO MUCH DELAY WHEN SEARCHING FOR A PHONE TO START LISTENING TO MY PANDORA IT OFTEN TIMES JUST STOPS WORKING
WHEN PLAYING FROM USB FLASH DRIVE THE SYSTEM ALWAYS STARTS PLAYING FROM FIRST SONG ALPHABETICALLY EVERY TIME IT SHOULD START WHERE YOU LEFT OFF LAST TIME
NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND MAP DISPLAY REMAIN DATED AND FAR BEHIND MANY OTHER CAR MANUFACTURERS IN EASE OF USE
THE FADING IN AND OUT OF THE HD SIGNAL IS A HUGE DETRACTOR FROM THE QUALITY OF OUR LISTENING EXPERIENCE SO I WOULD IMPROVE ON THAT ALSO IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION QUALITY
WE LIKE THE AUDIO DAILY HOWEVER WE ARE BOTH IN OUR 80 S AND USE AS LITTLE TECHNOLOGY AS NEEDED
TOUCH SCREEN REQUIRES MULTIPLE TOUCHES AT TIMES
WHEN SET TO THE HD RADIO SETTING THE STATION WILL SWITCH BETWEEN REGULAR AND HD MULTIPLE TIMES WHICH IS VERY DISTRACTING WHEN LISTENING THERE IS ALSO A LONG LAG TIME BETWEEN LINKING YOUR PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH TO THE CAR AND THE MUSIC PLAYING
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR NAV SYSTEM
BLUETOOTH VOICE RECOGNITION TAKES TOO LONG TO CONNECT TO PHONE
IT DOES THE WORK THE AUDIO SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD BECAUSE OF THE BOSE SYSTEM THE DESIGN IS FINE BUT NOT PERFECT AND SUPER COOL
DELAY TIME GOING FROM FM TO SATELLITE IS TOO LONG I M ALMOST TEMPTED TO TURN OFF THE HD RADIO BECAUSE IT CONSTANTLY GOES IN AND OUT WHEN LISTENING TO FM LOCAL STATIONS CHANGING THE SOUND AND MAKING IT A BIT ANNOYING
THE VOICE COMMANDS AREN T ALWAYS ACCURATE OR IT TAKES ME SEVERAL STEPS TO MAKE A CALL WHEN I SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO SAY PHONE CALL NAME BUT INSTEAD IT TAKES ME THROUGH EVERY STEP INDIVIDUALLY TAKES A LOT LONGER
DON T LIKE CD IS NOT STANDARD DON T LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN TO CONTROL
NAVIGATION SYSTEM TAKE A LONG TIME TO START UP ONCE THE CAR IS STARTED WHILE IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ANY OTHER SYSTEM CHANGE CHANGING VOLUME ON MUSIC UPLOADING CONTACTS VIA BLUETOOTH ETC COVERS UP THE SPACE WHERE THE NEXT DIRECTION INSTRUC
SIMPLIFY THE RADIO CONTROLS MAKE IT SO THAT I CAN SWITCH BETWEEN MY FAVORITE FM AND AM STATIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO MANIPULATE THE SCREEN
SOUND QUALITY OF THE PHONE CALLS I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ISN T A LOT YOU CAN DO WHEN YOU ARE USING ANY TYPE OF SPEAKER PHONE
SOME FEATURES YOU NEED WHILE DRIVING NAVIGATION CHANGE CAN BE NECESSARY UNEXPECTEDLY YOU HAVE TO STOP THE VEHICLE TO CHANGE A ROUTE I AM SUPPOSED TO GET TEXT MESSAGES BUT NEVER HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT ALWAYS GREETED OUT ALSO CANNOT ADD A CONTA
I WOULD RATE THIS AS AT LEAST AN 8 BUT THERE S NO CD PLAYER I HAVE OVER 500 CDS AND WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE ONE AS OF YET MY DEALER SAYS THERE S NONE AVAILABLE I ACTUALLY WOULDN T HAVE BOUGHT THIS CAR IF I D HAVE KNOWN THERE WAS NO CD PLAYE
OVERALL SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT NICE BASS
BLUETOOTH AUDIO PLAYBACK HAS AN ISSUE BUFFERING AND WILL PLAY THE MUSIC BACK AT VARIOUS RATES OF SPEED THIS IS EXACERBATED WHEN MUSIC IS PLAYING AND YOU ARE INTERACTING WITH THE SYSTEM
USING THE NAVAGATION SYSTEM CAN BE DIFFICULT IT S A BIT CONFUSING EVEN AFTER READING THE OWNERS MANUEL
PRESET BUTTONS ON HOME PAGE OF TOUCH SCREEN PRESETS ARE BURRIED
VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE PLAIN ENGLISH
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TRIES TO BE TOO SMART ALLOWING ONLY CHOICES IT THINKS I WANT TO MAKE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN TYPING IN A NEW LOCATION IT ASSUMES A DESTINATION AND WON T ALLOW ME TO HIT CERTAIN KEYS I FIND THIS ANNOYING BUT ONCE I WORK THROU
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A HIGHER RATING BUT INSTEAD OF USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I JUST USED GOOGLE MAPS FROM MY PHONE IT S EASIER AND I FOUND TO BE MORE ACCURATE WITH TRAFFIC
I M NOT VERY TECH SAVVY AND STEP BY STEP QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE WOULD BE HELPFUL
HAVING IPHONE CONNECTIVITY
USB PORT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS GARMIN ROUTES ARE OFTEN WRONG RESTAURANTS AREN T WHERE THEY SHOULD BE
VOICE COMMANDS ARE CLUNKY UNRELIABLE
ALTHOUGH IT HAS A BOSE SYSTEM I FEEL LIKE IT COULD HAVE BETTER AUDIO ADJUSTMENT OPTIONS SOUND BETTER
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS FOR BLUETOOTH
TRAFFIC DOES NOT INTERFACE WITH NAVIGATION
VOICE RECOGNITION
I HAVE THE BASE RADIO BUT IT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME THE ONLY UPGRADE I WOULD MAKE WOULD BE A SUB WOOFER THE IPOD CONTROLS AREN T WELL MARKED AND CAN BE A PAIN TO USE I JUST LEAVE IT ON SONGS AND RDM FOR RANDOM AGAIN THIS IS THE BASE RADIO CON
VERY DISAPPOINTED IN NO REAL TIME TRAFFIC CONNECTIVITY ONLY MAJOR FREEWAYS AND USING HD RADIO
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THE USB CONNECTIVITY AFTER 3 MONTHS OF OWNERSHIP SO I GAVE UP ON IT SUGGEST A HOW TO VOICE GUIDANCE LIKE THE PHONE AUDIO CONTROLS HAVE AND THAT WOULD BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT
VOICE COMMANDS FOR PHONE
UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM THE STOCK SYSTEM IS ADEQUATE BUT SEEMS TO SUFFER ON THE BASS END OF THE SPECTRUM
NEEDS BLUETOOTH AUDIO ALONG WITH THE PHONE
UPGRADE SPEAKERS TO IMPROVE SOUND QUALITY
LACK OF A HARD DRIVE
ACCURACY OF NAVIGATION
TOO MANY DIFFERENT CONTROLS TAKING TOO MANY STEPS TO GET TO THE DESIRED STATION OR OPTION OFTEN CAN ONLY USE WHEN STOPPED AS IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE TO USE WHILE DRIVING NAVIGATION IS SLOW AND DOES NOT UNDERSTAND VOICE COMMANDS OCCASIONALLY
DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE WITH THE COMAND SYSTEM TOO MANY MENUS AND SUBMENUS
NAVIGATION FRUSTRATES ME AND CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT
SICING IT WITH YOUR PHONE WHEN NEW AND BETTER EASE AT MAKING PHONE CALLS
TOUCH SCREEN MORE OPTIONS IT S A VERY BASIC SYSTEM
IT WOULD BE VERY NICE IF THERE WAS A POWER BUTTON THAT SHUTS OF THE AUDIO WHEN LISTENING TO THE RADIO MUTE GETS THE JOB DONE FINE HOWEVER WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC FROM A USB FLASH DRIVE I NEED TO SCROLL OVER TO THE PAUSE BUTTON TO STOP THE M
BLUETOOTH VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED
MORE FEATURES VIA BLUETOOTH TO OPERATE MUSIC
DISPLAY SCREEN SHOULD NOT BE STATIC DISPLAY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE LOWERED RAISED AS NEEDED IT SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SWIVEL TILT TO DRIVER PASSENGER BARKGROUND GRAPHIC SHOULD ALSO BE ONE COLOR CURRENT VERSION MAKES IT LOOK LIKE IMA
A USB PORT WOULD BE NICE BUT NOT A BIG ISSUE
VOICE RECOGNITION ACCURACY IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT
1 BLUETOOTH MOBILE PHONE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT MAYBE RELOCATE MIC LOCATION 2 IT WOULD BE NICE FOR THIS VEHICLE TO COME WITH FACTORY INSTALLED NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THERE IS NO COMPASS THE LAST MODEL HAD ONE AS PART OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IT IS A HELPFUL FEATURE I MISS
USER INTERFACE NEEDS A TOUCHSCREEN OR A BETTER WAY TO CONTROL THE VEHICLE SYSTEMS INPUT CONTROLS FOR MAIN SCREEN ARE VERY POOR AND TAKE WAY TOO MUCH TIME TO FIND AND ACCESS THE RELEVANT MENU S MENUS HAVE TOO MANY LEVELS AND TAKE TOO MUCH CONCENT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLICATED NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND
EASIER MORE USER FRIENDLY VOICE COMMANDS FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I CAN T USE BLUETOOTH FOR MY AUDIO MP3 NOW WHICH WAS A HUGE FEATURE FOR ME AND PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ISSUE WITH VOICE COMMAND AND NAVIGATION
VOICE COMMAND FOR NAVIGATION
TOUCH SCREEN NAVIGATION INPUT WOULD BE NICE
THE VOICE ACTIVATION FOR NAVIGATION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED IT RARELY UNDERSTANDS ADDRESS AND I USUALLY HAVE TO PROGRAM MANUALLY
THIS IS THE FOURTH M B CAR I VE PURCHASED IN THE PAST 10 YEARS AND BASED ON THE HORRIBLE NAVIGATION AND AUDIO SYSTEM ON THE C 350 IT MAY BE THE LAST M B VEHICLE I PURCHASE WHAT USED TO TAKE ONLY ONE OR TWO STEPS TO PROGRAM AND OPERATE FOR
THE NAVIGATION SERVICE IS NOT VERY INFORMATIVE MAP OF STREETS COULD BE BETTER
THE FONTS ON THE NAV SCREEN SHOWING STREET NAMES ARE TOO SMALL AND NOT ADJUSTABLE
NEED TO IMPROVE EASE OF USE AND MENU SELECTING USING THE COMMAND CONTROLLER THERE NEEDS TO BE SPECIFIC BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL DEDICATED TO CONTROLLING PRESETS ON THE RADIO JUST AS THERE ARE SPECIFIC BUTTONS FOR CONTROLLING THE VOLUME
RADIO CONTROLS
THE IDEA OF REMOVING THE FACTORY INSTALLED ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS WRONG THE NEW VERSION IS JUST A FRAME INSTALLATION FOR IPADS THIS IS NOT COOL
METHOD OF ENTERING DESTINATION IS A BIT CUMBERSOME ALSO WOULD LIKE CAR TO REMEMBER DEVICES CELL PHONES BY BLUETOOTH
THE ONE KNOB CONTROL IS CUMBERSOME AND SLOW TO INPUT INFOORMATION WITH THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM HAS NO INPUT FOR JUMP DRIVES IPOD ETC JUST A DVD SLOT
NOT USER FRIENDLY NAVIGATION SYSTEM POOR VOICE RECOGNITION
VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR 2000 TECHNOLOGY
NAVIGATION SCREEN SHOULD BE BUILT INTO THE DASH BOARD OR MADE LESS VISIBLE
USER FRIENDLY VOICE PROMPTS
NAVIGATION SHOULD SHOW TURN BY TURN IN ADVANCE I CAN ONLY SEE THE NEXT MOVE AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE ENTIRE ROUTE EVEN MY LAST CAR DID THAT I RELY MORE ON A GPS APP THEN I DO MY CAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NOT VERY INTUITIVE FOR LESS TECH SAVVY PEOPLE
MAP POOR SEE ABOVE STREET NAMES SMALL ALSO VOICE USED IN GUIDANCE CAN T BE INCREASED RADIO DROWNS OUT
GPS SYSTEM MAP DETAIL FOR ADDRESS LOCATION ACCURACY INSUFFICIENT MY 10 YEAR OLD GARMIN IS NEAR FLAWLESS ON DESTINATION ACCURACY AND DISPLAYS LOCAL SPEED LIMIT ON SCREEN NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CLUNKY TO OPERATE NO TOUCH SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION CONTINUES TO BE UNRELIABLE DESPITE DEALER PROMISES THAT THIS MODEL IS BETTER THAN THE LAST THREE CARS WE HAVE HAD
I WAS SHOCKED THAT IN TODAY S DAY AND AGE THE VEHICLE DID NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN I ASKED THE DEALER IF I COULD GET ONE INSTALLED HE SAID I COULD ONLY GET IT AS PART OF AN UPGRADE PACKAGE THAT WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY $3 000 VERY DISAP
I HAD THE PILOT NAVIGATION INSTALLED AND IT IS VERY CUMBERSOME TO USE SO HAVEN T YET
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH WE EVEN VISITED DEALERSHIP TO HELP US WITH IT AND IT STILL DID NOT WORK WILL HAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER APPOINTMENT TO GET IT DONE
NAVIGATION COULD HAVE BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT RECOGNIZE MY VOICE COMMANDS
EASIER MEANS OF ANDROID CELL PHONE MP3 S ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE GEARED TOWARDS APPLE PRODUCTS
LACK OF TOUCH SCREEN REALLY SUCKS THE MOUSE CONTROL IS A WAIST OF TIME
BIG LEARNING CURVE TO FIND THE AUDIO SEGMENTS THE VOICE COMMUNICATION IS JUST TOO COMPLICATED AND IT MISUNDERSTANDS FREQUENTLY THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LIKE MOST CARS I HAVE OWNED IS AWFUL FRANKLY I WISH IT WOULD JUST CONNECT TO GOOGLE MAPS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM TOO DIFFICULT GOOGLE MAPS ON PHONE IS EASIER
I WOULD RATHER TO HAVE TOUCH SCREEN INSTEAD OF WHEEL INTERFACE TAKE FOREVER TO ENTER ADDRESS AND NAVIGATE CROSS HAIR
HOW DO YOU TURN OFF THE RADIO OTHER THAN TURNING DOWN THE VOLUME WHEN YOU WANT TO BE IN SAY THE NAVIGATION MODE ONLY
AUDIO CONTROLS IT REQUIRES MULTIPLE SELECTIONS TO TOGGLE BETWEEN AM FM XM THERE ARE ONLY 6 PRESETS DISPLAYED AT A TIME IT WOULD BE NICE IF THESE ADVANCED SEQUENTIALLY MY WIFE S MINIVAN IS EASIER TO USE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SLOW AND LIMITED MY SMART PHONE IS WAY FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE
THE OVERALL SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS AWESOME I HAVE NOTHING BAD TO SAY AT ALL ABOUT THE LINCOLN MKZ
THE VOICE QUALITY ON PHONE CALLS COULD BE MUCH BETTER
VOICE NAVIGATION IS NOT THE EASIEST TO USE OR THE MOST RELIABLE WHEN GIVING VOICE COMMANDS
THE MENU TO USE THE MP3 PLAYER HAS TOO MANY SCREENS TO GET THROUGH IN ORDER TO FIND A SONG ON A PLAYLIST EYES ARE OFF THE ROAD TOO LONG NAVIGATION CAN T ALWAYS FIND A PLACE OF INTEREST
HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF MANY TIMES TO GET TO THE RIGHT OPTIONS WHEN USING VOICE RECOGNITION GETS REALLY FRUSTRATING HAVENT EXPERIENCED THESE ISSUES IN OTHER VEHICLES
THE MYLINCOLNTOUCH SYSTEM SOMETIMES SWITCHES BETWEEN SCREENS WITHOUT PROMPTING THE SWITCH ESPECIALLY WHEN IN REVERSE AFTER THE REAR CAMERA SCREEN SWITCHES BACK TO MYLINCOLNTOUCH
NOT SURE WHY FORD LINCOLN DOES NOT OFFER APPLICATION CONTROLS ONSCREEN FOR PANDORA ETC BEYOND BASIC PAUSE PLAY SKIP
EASE OF INITIAL CONNECTING TO THE SYNC SYSTEM AND IMPROVEMENT IN VOICE COMMAND ABILITY
NAVIGATION AND VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS EITHER SIRI OR GOOGLE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM REQUIRES MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS
I DON T HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE SOUND QUALITY AND CONNECTION ON THE HANDS FREE CALLING IS HORRIBLE IT DISTORTS AND HAS A LOT OF FEEDBACK
STEREO IS AWESOME EXTERNAL CONTROL REFINED NAV AND VOICE COULD USE AN UPGRADE
SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE WORDS SIRIUSXM IS TERRIBLE TO DEAL WITH
BETTER SPEAKER QUALITY WHILE ITS PLEASANT FOR A LUXURY VEHICLE I WOULD PREFER BOSE TYPE OF SPEAKERS WHERE TREBLE AND BASS IS QUITE CLEAR
ABLE TO USE ALL THE NAVIGATION WHILE DRIVING AN UNDISTRACTED PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADD INPUT
THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT GOOD COMPARED TO MY LEXUS THE CONTROLS ARE SMALL DIFFICULT TO READ WHILE DRIVING THE TIME BETWEEN SCREEN CHANGES IS SLOW I JUST FIND THE SYNC SYSTEM TO BE POOR AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TOO DIFFICULT TO USE COMPARED
IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE VOICE COMMANDS READ TEXTS
IF THE SATELITE RADIO DID NOT CUT OUT I D HAVE GIVEN IT A 10 HERE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT AS ACCURATE AS MY PORTABLE SYSTEM IT IS NOT UP TO DATE NOR WAS IT WHEN I TOOK DELIVERY OF THE VEHICLE
MAPPING IS NOWHERE NEAR AS EFFECTIVE OR ADVANCED AS GOOGLE MAPS VOICE RECOGNITION COMMANDS ARE NOT INTUITIVE ENOUGH AND THE PROMPTS ARE INFERIOR TO OTHER SIMILAR SYSTEMS
HAVE DIFFICULTY COMMUNICATING WITH SYNC
A LITTLE EASIER FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND VOICE RECOGNITION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY
IT HARDLY GETS THE NAME RIGHT WHEN ASKING TO USE THE PHONE TO CALL SOMEONE OR SPELL OUT A DESTINATION I MORE OFTEN THAN NOT HAVE TO MANUALLY INPUT THE DESTINATION THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATION IS WHEN I PLUG MY PHONE IN TO CHARGE IT AUTOMATICALLY G
NAV SYSTEM NOT RELIABLE
VOICE COMMANDS FOR CONTROL IS SLOW AND NOT UNDERSTOOD BY THE VEHICLE OFTEN ABILITY FOR TOUCH SCREEN INPUTS TO NAVIGATION BY PASSENGER NOT ALLOWED IF VEHICLE IS MOVING WOULD BE NICE IF PASSENGER CAN SEARCH NAVIGATION AND INPUT DATA
VOICE RECOGNITION OF PHONE
VOICE NAVIGATION DOESN T WORK AS WELL AS MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE BUT IT IS STILL GOOD
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A SUB WOOFER BUILT IN AND SPEAKERS IN THE BACK OF THE CAR VERSUS THE BACK DOORS
THE KNOB THAT CONTROLS THE VARIOUS VEHICLE MODES IS IN A POOR LOCATION I M CONSTANTLY BUMPING IT WITH MY ARM NOTICE NOT HAND OR AN OBJECT IT NEEDS TO BE PLACED BACK ON THE DASH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN TO SWITCH BETWEEN
CLASSIC IPOD IS NOT RECOGNIZED BY SYSTEM HAD TO MOVE ALL OF ITUNES TO SD CARD
NAVIGATION COULD BE SIMPLIFIED
SPEED UP INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND IMPROVE BUILT IN APPS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS AWFUL MY FORD PICKUP HAS A BETTER SYSTEM
NAVIGATION DISPLAY IS VERY BUSY NEED TO HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN
PRINT IS VERY SMALL ON MAPS
WOULD HAVE LIKED VOICE CONTROL FOR PHONE BUT THAT PACKAGE WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT TIME OF PURCHASE NAVIGATION CARD WAY TOO EXPENSIVE SHOULD BE $100 OR LESS
SOUND FROM SATELLITE IS MUFFLED
USE GOOGLE MAPS INSTEAD OF MERCEDES BENZ MAPS
WOULD LIKE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO DISPLAY SPEED LIMIT OF CURRENT ROAD
VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETIMES INCONSISTENT
NAVIGATION MENUS ARE FAR FROM INTUITIVE M B SHOULD HAVE LICENSED BMW S NAVIGATION AND CONTROL SYSTEM WHICH IS MORE INTUITIVE AND SEEMS JUST TO WORK BETTER
NEED TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS AND BE ALLOWED TO CHANGE NAV SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING
TOO MUCH REDUNDANCY IN SYSTEMS VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM OFTEN MISUNDERSTANDS MY INSTRUCTION
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL
THE AUDIO AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOOKS REALLY GOOD BUT IT S NOT EASY TO USE MAYBE BECAUSE MY AGE 79 YEARS OLD
THE GERMAN S ARE BEHIND THE REST OF THE WORLD IN THAT THEY DO NOT USE TOUCH SCREEN FOR NAVIGATION YOU HAVE TO USE THE TIME CONSUMING WHEEL TO GET YOUR ADDRESS IN
PHONE CALLS ARE VERY LOW COMPARED TO RADIO VOLUME
AGAIN BLUETOOTH MICROPHONE IS TERRIBLE AND APPS THAT DEPENDS ON THE MERCEDES INTERNET SIMPLY DO NOT WORK
GREAT AUDIO GOOD NAV HORRIBLE VOICE RECOGNITION
WHEN YOU CONNECT AN IPOD CELL PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH TO BE ABLE TO SWITCH PLAYLISTS SEARCH SONGS INSTEAD OF ONLY BEING ABLE TO SKIP OR REVERSE
COMPARED TO THE BMW SYSTEM IT S A LITTLE KLUNKY AND LESS INTUITIVE THE BMW SCREEN NAVIGATION REMINDS ME OF MY IPHONE THE MB SCREEN TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO BECAUSE THE NAVIGATION ISN T AS LOGICAL SEVERAL TIMES I VE GOTTEN STUCK ON THE PHON
THE MAP DISPLAY IS HARD TO READ YOU CAN T ZOOM IN AS CLOSE AS I WOULD LIKE I ACTUALLY JUST USE MY IPHONE MAPS APP AND SET IT UP RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE NAVIGATION SCREEN
SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER FOR THE PRICE
THE DISPLAY IS A BIT OUTDATED AND NOT A TOUCH SCREEN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS TOO MANY STEPS MAKE IT SIMPLE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS QUITE INEPT I HAVE HAD TWO MERCEDES BENZ AND THE NAVI IS VERY OUTDATED AND UNPREDICTABLE IN ITS ABILITY TO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF THE CAR S MOVEMENT IN RELATION TO THE ACTUAL DIRECTION THE CAR IS GOING I HAVE RENTED B
STILL NOT ABLE TO FIGURE OUT TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
WOULD RATHER HAVE TOUCH SCREEN FOR NAVIGATION
IT S HARD TO ENTER AN ADDRESS I WOULD LIKE TO USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND SIMPLY SAY DIRECTIONS TO AND THEN GIVE THE ADDRESS IT S TAKEN TOO LONG TO USE AND I HAVE ENDED UP USING GOOGLE MAPS ON OR SIRI ON MY IPHONE I PREFER TO USE THESE
HAVING DIGITAL SPEEDOMETER AND MILEAGE INFORMATION ALWAYS VISIBLE REGARDLESS OF THE AUDIO SETTING THE AUDIO SHOULD NOT TAKE AWAY FROM MILEAGE AND SPEEDOMETER
THE VOICE RECOGNITION
A 25K AMERICAN CAR HAS MORE ADVANCE HI TECH ELECTRONIC DISPLAY NOW DAYS
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE POOR VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND OR MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO ENTER DESTINATION MANUALLY WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING AS ON THE BMW 5 SERIES PULLING OFF THE HIGHWAY TO ENTER A NEW DESTINATION IS A MAJOR ANNOYANCE
SOUND QUALITY OF RADIO COULD BE BETTER EVEN WITH THE FACTORY SPEAKERS THE TELEPHONE AUDIO ISN T VERY CRISP
POOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM

DIFFICULT TO CONNECT AND USE GO WITH APPLE AND STOP MAKING SYSTEMS THAT PERFORM POORLY AND ARE NOT UPDATED TO WORK WITH CURRENT PHONES

THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HERD TO OPERATE
SPLIT SCREEN WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL ABILITY TO SEE BOTH THE MAP AND THE AUDIO DETAILS AT THE SAME TIME THIS IS AVAILABLE IN LEXUS ES MODEL
TOUCH SCREEN FOR THE NAVIGATION THE KNOB IS AWKWARD AND TIME CONSUMING
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A TOUCHSCREEN
GIVEN THE FEATURES OF A SMART PHONE TODAY THE SL COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENTS
XM RADIO SHOULD NOT CUT OUT
IT HAS PROBLEM READING THE MP3 FILES ON MY USB DRIVE
ENHANCED VOICE RECOGNITION
MORE VOICE COMMANDS WOULD BE USEFUL FOR SAFETY SYSTEM CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS FOR NAVIGATION

BOSE SYSTEM HAD THIS IN OUR MURANO AND LOVED IT

WISH THE TEXT OPTIONS WOULD WORK WITH IPHONES
BETTER TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE THAT CHANGES LIGHTS AND EASIER MAIN MENU LIKE THE NEW FORD F 150 IS NICE EASIER MENU AND VOICE ACTIVATED MENU SYSTEM OPTIONS LIKE THE CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY HAND CONTROLS ARE TOO COMPLICATED AND DON T LIKE PLACE
CONTROLS FOR THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM THE BUTTON ICONOGRAPHY COULD BE BETTER ALSO THE LACK OF A MANUAL AND A CURSORY REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM IN THE VIDEO GUIDE WERE NOT AS HELPFUL AS I WOULD LIKE LEAVING MUCH OF THE LEARNING ABOUT THE SYSTEM
PUTTING IN NEW ADDRESSES FOR NAVIGATION IS CUMBERSOME COMPARED TO OTHER GPS SYSTEMS I HAVE USED
DIFFERENT PLACMENT AND SIZE OF STEERING WHEEL CONTROL YOU MUST LOOK AT THEM TO CHANGE CHANNEL OR VOLUME

IDEAL WOULD BE TO HAVE NAVIGATION APP LIKE WAZE BE CONNECTED TO THE CAR VIDEO AND AUDIO SYSTEMS
TOO MANY STEPS TO USE VOICE CONTROL MAKES IT NOT REALLY WORTH USING TOO MANY STEPS TO ENTER ADDRESS INTO NAV SYSTEM ALWAYS USE AN APP ON THE CELLPHONE INSTEAD
THE THREE MEMORY CLUSTERS FOR FM SIRIUS ETC ARE IRRITATING YOU ARE FORCED TO GO INTO TWO MENUS TO SCROLL THROUGH ANY MORE THAN THE CHANNELS IN ANY ONE CLUSTER THIS SHOULD ALL BE ONE YOU CAN SCROLL THROUGH LIKE IN A BMW THE NAVIGATION SHOU

WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE FEATURE THE SYSTEM CAN NEVER RECOGNIZE WHO I AM TRYING TO CALL AND ALWAYS ATTEMPTS TO CALL 911 THEREFORE I USUALLY CALL SOMEONE AND THEN HOOK IT UP TO THE VEHICLE

THE KEYPAD IS HARD TO USE AND VERY TOUCHY WOULD PREFER TOUCHSCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION IS CUMBERSOME AND TAKES TOO LONG TO ACHIEVE DESIRED RESULTS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN WRONG ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS ROUTE GUIDANCE THE TOUCH PAD SYSTEM IS MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT IT IS CUMBERSOME SLOW CONFUSING AND INEFFICIENT AND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH IT IS IT CONTROLS EVERYTHING IN THE CAR
BLUETOOTH INTEGRATION WITH MY IPHONE HAS AN ISSUE WHEN USING A NAVIGATION APP ON MY PHONE INSTEAD OF THE BUILT IN LEXUS NAVIGATION IT TREATS DRIVING ANNOUNCEMENTS AS PHONE CALLS AND DISRUPTS MUSIC PLAYBACK IT SHOULD TREAT PHONE BASED DRIVING
TOUCH PAD IS TOO SENSITIVE
THE MOUSE STYLE SYSTEM TO ACCESS THE NAVIGATION AND OTHER SYSTEMS IS IMPRECISE AND JUMPY THIS IS CLEARLY AN AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT
APPS ARE DIFFICULT TO SET UP VERY DIFFICULT
I WOULD LIKE INTERNET AND TRAFFIC CONNECTIVITY WITHOUT HAVING TO SUBSCRIBE TO SIRIUS FOR IT
CONNECTIVITY TO PANDORA LEXUS LINK IS UNACCEPTABLE
MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE NAVIGATION IS TOO COMPLICATED FOR SOMEONE WHO IS NOT PARTICULARY COMPUTER SAVY I M HAVIG A VERY DIFFICULT TIME LEARNING IT VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN SO I M ONLY USIG TH VOICE PORTION
HANDS FREE PHONE SOUNDS TINNY AND HAS ROAD NOISE
VOICE COMMAND AND NAV IS HARD TO USE NOT AS INTUITIVE AS IT SHOULD BE
I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS BUT THE SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLEX AS COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE OWNED ALSO I WISH THIS HAD AN INTERNAL HARD DRIVE TO STORE MUSIC SINCE I DO NOT USE A CONNECTED DEVICE FOR A CAR OF THIS CALIBER THIS ONE F
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO USE
GOBACK TO SIMPLE CAR AND RADIO DO I REALLY NEED TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE ALBUM THE SONG IS FROM MAKE CONTROLS EASIER FOR DRIVER WHY SO COMPLICATED WHEN I THOUGHT YOU SHOULDN T TEXT AND DRIVE THE DRIVING IS THE ONLY SIMPLE THING ABOUT THE CAR A
NEEDS A TOUCH SCREEN NOT A MOUSE TYPE CONTROLLER TO ACCESS MENUS ON SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD RECOGNIZE COMMON COMMANDS CONSISTENTLY
POOR AUDIO QUALITY AND REQUIRES VOLUME TO BE TURNED WAY UP TO HEAR DURING A PHONE CALL AND OTHERS COMPLAIN THEY CAN T HEAR ME WELL
TRYING TO TELL THE NAV SYSTEM A STREET ADDRESS IS VERY PROTRACTED
TOUCH SCREEN USE
LOVE THE HANDS FREE OPTION IT S STILL NOT A GOOD IDEA TO USE THE PHONE WHILE DRIVING BUT HANDS FREE IS GREAT
DO NOT REALLY CARE FOR TOUCH SCREEN
I D LIKE BETTER EASIER CONTROL IN FINDING THE MUSIC I WANT ON MY PHONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION USING THE TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS YOU HAVE TO SCROLL ALL THE WAY DOWN A LONG LIST OF ARTISTS TO FIND THE ONE YOU WANT AND THE SCROLL DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK
IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO PUT IN A DESTINATION INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN YOU HAVE TO SAY ALL THE PROPER COMMENDS MY HUSBAND WOULD MUCH RATHER USE GOOGLE MAPS ON HIS PHONE BECAUSE HE JUST HAS TO SAY THE DESTINATION AND THEN PUT A BUTTON TO
SEPARATE MANUAL FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
PHONEBOOK NAME RECOGNITION CAN T UNDERSTAND THE WORK HOME WHEN I SAY CALL HOME
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
ADD A SEEK BUTTON TO THE STEERING WHEEL YOU CAN SCAN PRESETS BUT YOU CAN T SEEK STATION BY STATION THIS REQUIRES ME TO LEAN AND PLACE MY HAND ON THE BUTTON IN THE CENTER
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PRESET RADIO STATIONS AVAILABLE ON STEERING WHEEL SO THAT I DON T HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO CHANGE STATIONS I DO PLAN TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN TRAVELING BUT CURRENTLY I LOVE MY GOOGLE MAPS APPLICATION ON P
DON T HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SET UP AND ONLY USE THE PHONE SYSTEM AND RADIO
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT GOOD HAVE TROUBLE RECOGNISING WHAT I AM SAYING
WITH THE NAVIGATION AND THE PHONE THE SYSTEM HAVE PROBLEMS GETTING MY REQUEST CORRECT SOMETIMES THE PHONE GET NAME REQUEST WRONG SOMETIMES AND WILL NOT DISCONNECT IN THE DESIRED AMOUNT OF TIME THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOMETIMES GO OUT OF THE WAY T
TOUCH PAD IS TOO SENSITIVE EVEN WHEN SET TO LEAST SENSITIVE SETTING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE EASIER AND LESS FRUSTRATING
HEADS UP DISPLAY
TOUCH PAD TAKES A LOT OF GETTING USED TO KEEPING THINGS OFF OF IT IN ITS CURRENT LOCATION IS DIFFICULT FOREIGN OBJECTS CANS BOTTLES ETC CAN ACCIDENTALLY TOUCH THIS PAD EASILY AND QUICKLY IMPART INFORMATION THAT CAUSES THE SYSTEM TO DO UNEXP
AGAIN THE DISPLAY IS NOT THE EASIEST TO NAVIGATE SEVERAL BUTTONS TO GET TO THE WEATHER MAP FOR EXAMPLE
BUTTONS & NOT TOUCH SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION OFTEN HAVE TO REPEAT COMMAND FOR IT TO SELECT PROPERLY
REAR SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW HD DVD S
MICROPHONE ON PHONE CALLS
BUILT IN HARD DRIVE
FIRST CAR I VE OWNED THAT S SO HIGH TECH I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO I LIKE MINE
IF THERE IS A PASSENGER IN THE CAR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD WORK MAYBE BE WEIGHT CONTROLLED JUST AN IDEA
VERY SLOW TO INPUT INFORMATION IN THE NAVAGATION WOULD BE NICE TO SAVE AS A FAVORITE NAME INSTEAD OF ADDRESSES
PHONE RECOGNITION IS NOT CONSISTENT NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE I HAVE YET FOR IT TO PULL UP A DESTINATION WITHOUT HAVING TO GOOGLE IT ON MY CELL PHONE AND TYPE IN THE PHYSICAL ADDRESS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOCKS OUT CHANGES WHEN VEHICLE IS IN MOTION EVEN WHEN THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER IS ATTEMPTING TO USE THE SYSTEM
MY HUSBAND HATES THE FACT THAT WHEN HE IS DRIVING IT AND I AM NOT IN THE CAR IT KEEPS SEARCHING FOR MY IPHONE UNTIL HE HITS CANCEL ON THE TOUCH SCREEN HE DOES NOT HAVE HIS PHONE SYNCED TO MY CAR
NAVIGATION MAP IS ABOUT 12 18 MONTHS DATED LIVE IN AN AREA WITH A LOT OF NEW CONSTRUCTION
DON T CARE FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I PREFER MY PLUG IN
IT IS A LONG REACH TO THE NAVIGATION BUTTON WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING
THE ONLY THING I THINK COULD REALLY BE IMPROVED IS THE SENSITIVITY OF THE TOUCH SCREEN I ACTUALLY HAVE TO PUSH THE TOUCH SCREEN TO GET IT TO RECOGNIZE MY COMMANDS ON A TABLET FOR EXAMPLE ALL I MUST DO IS LIGHTLY TOUCH IT
VOICE RECOGNITION ON NAV SYSTEM
SO FAR BEHIND THE CURVE IN WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT IN EASE OF OPERATION HAVE TRIED MAKING PHONE CALLS THROUGH SYSTEM AND ONLY WORKS SPORADICALLY I CAN HEAR OTHER PERSON THEY CANNOT HEAR ME HAVE TO RECONNECT TO GET IT TO WORK THE HIGH END FEATUR
WOULD HAVE AM STEREO OR HD WOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY PLAY U2 CALIFORNIA WHEN CONNECTING IPHONE
I AM NOT YET COMFORTABLE WITH THE NAV SYSTEM IN THIS CAR YET I NEED TO REVIEW AND STUDY THE APPLICATIONS FURTHER IT IS DIFFERENT FROM MY PRIOR VEHICLE WHICH I AM STILL USED TO
I WISH THE VOICE COMMANDS WERE SOMEHOW MORE INTUITIVE SO WE COULD EASILY NAVIGATE THROUGH ALL THE AMAZING POSSIBILITIES WITHOUT EVER TAKING OUR EYES OFF THE ROAD
MAKE IT SIMPLER FOR USE ESPECIALLY LESS TECH ADVANCED PEOPLE
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAID
VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY DIFFICULT TOUCH PANEL IS HYPER SENSITIVE
OVERALL THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE WHEN DOING IT MANUALLY IT IS NOT INTUITIVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS IN THE DATA ENTRY PROCESS WHEN USING IT THROUGH THE VOICE COMMANDS YOU WORK DOWN TO SPECIFIC LISTS AND THEN CAN T MA
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ACCURACY NEEDS TO BE FIXED THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE FIXED
I USE MY IPHONE AS A SOURCE FOR MOST NAV AND AUDIO I WOULD PREFER IF THE CAR CAME EQUIPPED WITH CARPLAY
CHANGE THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM PRIMITIVE AND VERY SLOW
SYSTEM IS QUITE SLOW TO RESPOND AFTER USING TOUCH SCREEN ALSO NEED TO IMPROVE NUMBER OF RADIO STATIONS THAT CAN BE PROGRAMMED IT ONLY ALLOWS 6 STATIONS PER SETTING
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAS TOO MANY STEPS TO MAKE A CALL SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY CALL RICK AND SYSTEM SHOULD DO IT UNDERSTAND IT SHOULD NOT TAKE 5 COMMANDS TO HAVE TO MAKE A PHONE CALL
HAVING STANDARD SATELLITE RADIO
I DID NOT OPT FOR THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM HOWEVER THE BOSE SYSTEM HAS A RICHER SOUND
THE WORST NAV SYSTEM I HAVE EVER USED DIFFICULT INACCURATE SLOW
A SIMPLER WAY TO MODULATE VOLUME OF INCOMING BLUETOOTH CALLS
THE INFOTAINMENT SCREEN IS EXTREMELY SLOW AND GLITCHY
THE IN CONTROL APPS IS A COMPLETE WASTE IF YOU MADE IT THROUGH BLUETOOTH THEN IT WOULD BE SOMEWHAT MORE USEFUL NOT MUCH BUT MORE USEFUL
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ABILITY TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND PART OF THE SYSTEM I GIVE IT AN AVERAGE THE REST OF THE SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO HAVE TO REPEAT AND VERY DISTRACTING OVER AND OVER YOUR COMMANDS WHILE TRYING TO DRIVE
VOLUME CONTROL DOES NOT SHOW LEVEL ON TOUCH SCREEN NOR SYSTEM SCREEN NOT ABLE TO SWITCH MODES FROM STEERING WHEEL AUDIO DURING CALLS COULD BE BETTER IN QUALITY AND CLEARNESS
BETTER MICROPHONE AND SPEAKERS THE SOUND WHILE ON PHONE CALLS IS TERRIBLE BOTH FOR ME AND THE PERSON I M TALKING TO AS SOMEONE THAT WORKS OUT OF THEIR CAR THIS IS IMPORTANT
AUDIO CONTROLS ARE OVERLY COMPLICATED CONTROLS SHOULD HAVE DEDICATED KNOBS RATHER THAN HAVING TO BE ACCESSED THROUGH THE NAV SYSTEM NAV SYSTEM CONTROLS ARE OVERLY COMPLICATED ALSO AND NOT NEARLY AS INTUITIVE AS SAY A GARMIN
FIX THE IPOD ERROR I KEEP GETTING AND PUT MORE CONTROL ON THE STEERING WHEEL THE PRIUS IS BETTER EQUIPPED THAN THE LEXUS WHEN IT COMES TO OPERATING THE SOUND SYSTEM WITHOUT TAKING YOUR HANDS OFF THE STEERING WHEEL
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO VIEW APPS FROM MY ANDROID PHONE SUCH AS WAZE AND DOGGCATCHER PODCAST PLAYER ON THE DISPLAY SCREEN OF THE CAR
IT HAS A HARD TIME STAYING CONNECTED TO MY IPHONE IT CONSTANTLY DISCONNECT MY IPHONE AND STOP MY MUSIC
SPEAKERS COULD USE AN UPGRADE CAN T BELIEVE THEY RE THE SAME AS THE TOYOTA PRIUS YOU WOULD THINK THE CT200H WOULD HAVE AT LEAST A KARDON HARMAN FOR THE PRICE
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND COMMANDS ADJUSTING RADIO CONTROLS AND TOGGLING FROM RADIO TO NAVI IS VERY CUMBERSOME AND CAUSES CONCENTRATION ISSUES WHILE DRIVING
NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO LEARN
GET RID OF THE JOIST STICK AND MAKE IT TOUCH SCREEN IT WOULD BE WAY MORE USER FRIENDLY
AUDIO VOLUME IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT WHEN GOING BETWEEN SATELLITE AND FM STATIONS
WITHOUT NAVIGATION PANE IT IS CUMBERSOME
MAKE IT SO THAT THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM DOESN T RESET ITSELF ONCE PER MONTH
THE SUB WOOFER IS MUCH LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE ONE IN THE CX9 GO BACK TO THE BETTER ONE
I HATE THE TOUCH SCREEN FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER IT IS GROSS AND DISTRACTING I DON T LIKE THAT I HAVE ALL CONTROLS IN ONE PLACE I HAVE TO NAVIGATE TO FIND MY PRESET CHANNELS OR JUST SCROLL THROUGH THEM ALL NOW THAT I HAVE FMHD WHATEVER THAT
VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE WHEN MAKING CALL EX YOU HAVE TO SAY PHONE WAIT FOR THE RESPONSE THEN SAY NAME WAIT FOR THE RESPONSE WHEN I TRY TO SAY CALL MARY MOBILE IT GIVE ME A STRANGE MESSAGE COMPLETELY UNRELATED
A MORE RELIABLE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND FULL FLEDGED ALBUM COVERS FOR MY MUSIC WHEN PLAYING THE MEDIA THROUGH THE USB DRIVE
JUST ONE GOOGLE MAPS WINS OUT OVER THE VEHICLE S NAVIGATION SYSTEM NO CONTEST TOO HARD TO ENTER LOCATIONS HAVEN T EVEN FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO POINTS OF INTEREST NAVIGATION NOT TIMELY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM LAGS AND DOES NOT PROGRESS THROUGH THE DIRECTIONS AS THE CAR IS MOVING ALONG THE ROUTE
SOUND SYSTEM IS GREAT BLUETOOTH IS WELL JUST BLUETOOTH
UNABLE TO UPLOAD PHONE BOOK SHOULD BE AN OPTION ALSO VOICE RECOGNITION FOR AUDIO MEDIA CONTROLS
THE CONVERTIBLE TOP STILL MAKES IT A LITTLE TOO NOISY TO TALK ON THE PHONE I CAN CONNECT MY PHONE OR IPOD BUT I HAVE TO CONTROL IT THROUGH MY PHONE I CAN T USE THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO LOOK AT MY PHONE IPOD WHILE DRIVING
PRETTY MUCH ANY NEW VEHICLE TODAY COMES WITH BLUETOOTH CONNECTION THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE MAZDA5 UNLESS YOU BUY AN EXTERNAL BLUETOOTH CONNECTOR WHICH IN TODAYS VEHICLE MARKET SHOULD REALLY NOT BE THE CASE I SET OUT TO BUY A VEHICLE THAT I
THE VOICE COMMAND IS HORRIBLE FOR NAVIGATION THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE PERIOD THE SOUND SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE AS WELL ONLY FEATURE I LIKE IS THE IPOD CONNECTION AND
THERE IS NO USB PORT
BETTER SOUND QUALITY IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO ACCESS MY MP3S FROM MY CELL PHONE LIKE A ONE TOUCH FEATURE
HAD TO SUPPLY MY OWN CABLE TO CONNECT MY IPOD AND HAVE TO HAVE THE CABLE ON TOP OF THE STICK SHIFT CENTER CONSOLE ALL THE TIME THE AUDIO ON THE HANDS FREE PHONE IS NOT THAT GREAT HAD TO TAKE CONFERENCE CALLS FROM WORK WHILE DRIVING AND IT IS PR
I WISH THERE WERE A WIDER VARIETY OF VOICE COMMANDS WHICH COULD BE UNDERSTOOD INTERPRETED AUDIO SYSTEM PARTICULARLY USB COULD BE A BIT MORE STABLE AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE EASIER TO USE
MAKE SATELLITE RADIO AVAILABLE
USE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY FOR THE GPS NAVIGATION THERE IS NO REASON TO DOWNGRADE THIS SYSTEM IN A MODEL WHEN COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS
I D PREFER A FULL TURN BY TURN LIST OPTION ALTHOUGH IT GIVES OPTION IT ONLY LISTS A FEW IN ADVANCE AS WITH MOST NAVIGATION SYSTEMS SOMETIMES THE ROUTE IT HAS CHOSEN INCLUDES STEPS THAT ORE NOT NECESSARY OR A ROUTE THAT DRIVER WOULD PREFER NOT T
NO GPS NO BACK UP CAMERA AUDIO SIRIUS DOES NOT DISPLAY STATION NAME
LABELING OF THE BUTTONS ON THE DASHBOARD FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM ARE NOT PARTICULARLY INTUITIVE IT HAS TAKEN ME A WHILE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EACH BUTTON OPERATES WHICH FEATURE
INCORPORATE APPLE CARPLAY INTO THE SYSTEM
CUSTOMER FRIENDLY INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO OPERATE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
ALL CARS OF THIS CLASS SHOULD COME WITH A NAV SYSTEM
WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEARCH FOR RADIO STATIONS AND CHANGE BANDS AM FM SAT WITHOUT HAVING TO BE DISTRACTED USING TOUCH SCREEN FINGER PAD TO DRILL DOWN THROUGH MULTIPLE MENU LEVELS
THE NOISE FOR INCOMING PHONE CALLS IS VERY ALARMING AND SHOULD BE CHANGED OR AT LEAST CONFIGURABLE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS SUB PAR
THE BLUETOOTH IS UNUSABLE AS THE SOUND QUALITY IS ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO A HOMEMADE AM RADIO POORLY TUNED THE VOLUME CONTROL OF THE RADIO IS WHERE THE TUNING SHOULD BE AND VICE VERSE
CLUNKY SCREEN CONTROL TOUCH PAD LOOKS GOOD ON PAPER BUT IS MORE HINDER THAN HELP TOO MANY SUB MANUALS DISTRACTING DRIVING WHEN WORKING WITH SYSTEM
AUDIO IS OUTSTANDING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IS ALSO OUTSTANDING THE NAVIGATION LAGS A BIT AND IS A BIT COMPLICATED TO USE
MICROPHONE BLUETOOTH TO ALLOW HANDSFREE CALLS WHEN DRIVING
SCREEN IS TOO LARGE AND WOULD BE BETTER IN THE DASH RATHER THAN ABOVE IT SOUND QUALITY IS SUBPAR
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENT I DON T LIKE HAVING TO REPEAT A NAME WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A CALL
WOULD PREFER THAT CHANGING OF RADIO FROM SAT FM AM CHOICES WAS NOT BURIED UNDER SEVERAL MENU STEPS
ADD THE ABILITY TO GIVE A DISTINATION NAME RATHER THAN JUST THE ADDRESS ONLY TO MAP A LOCATION
CONTROLS ARE CLUMSY MAKE IT A TOUCH SCREEN LET ME GET TEXTS LET ME SEND TEXTS MAKE IT EASY
HORRIBLE POPPIN SOUND WHILE ON BLUETOOTH
NAV IS POOR TO FIND THE CORRECT DESTINATION DIRECTIONS ARE OFTEN WRONG SMART PHONE IPHONE APPS ARE BETTER CONTROLS AREA BURDEN AND SEEM INADEQUATE FOR THE QUALITY OF THE CAR
I WOULD LIKE TO USE THE NAV SYSTEM WITH THE VOICE COMMANDS OFF MY BMW WILL SILENTLY GUIDE ME BUT NOT THIS CAR
NAVIGATION IS WORTHLESS IN MERCEDES BENZ
DISPLAY IS VERY BASIC NEEDS TOUCH SCREEN
PASSENGER IS UNABLE TO ENTER NAVIGATION REQUEST ONCE VEHICLE IS UNDERWAY THIS REQUIRES COMING TO A STOP IN ORDER TO PLOT NEW INFORMATION
CHANGING RADIO STATIONS DIFFICULT DUE TO LOCATION AND NOT CLEARLY MARKED CONTROLS BUTTONS ARE BLACK WITH DARK NUMBERS VERY HARD TO SEE
I STILL HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE HANDS FREE CALLING I VE CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH BUT DON T GET ANY SOUNDS SHOULD BE EASIER TO FIGURE OUT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T ALLOW MUCH ACTIVITY WHILE THE CAR IS IN OPERATION THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER CANNOT ENTER OR SEARCH FOR A DESTINATION I SEE IT FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT BUT IT S A PROBLEM WHEN THE PASSENGER CAN T OPERATE IT WHILE T
IT TAKES AWHILE TO LEARN HOW TO WORK EVERYTHING IT IS HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHICH OPTION CALLS UP SAVED ADDRESSES WITH THE CURRENT LABELS HOW ABOUT INCLUDING THE WORD SAVED
THE NAVIGATOR IS TOO QUITE
GALAXY ANDROID PHONE INTEGRATION AS WELL AS IPHONE 6 INTEGRATION
TOO MANY TWISTS TURNS PUSH WITH KNOBS MAKE IT TOUCH SCREEN THE TECHNOLOGY IS OUT THERE MY NEW CAMRY BOUGHT A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE MERCEDES IS MILES AHEAD HERE AND COST LESS
NEEDS TOUCH SCREEN
CHRYSLER PRODUCT NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS FAR SUPERIPR
NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE AND NO SUPPORT
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT CONSISTENT THE NAV SYSTEM IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE COMPARED TO MY CELL PHONE
A PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN THE SYSTEM WHILE IN MOTION WITHOUT STOPPING THE VEHICLE CERTAIN APPS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WHILE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION
NEED A TOUCH SCREEN FOR IT RIGHT NOW WITH MOBILE DEVICE BEING TOUCHSCREEN IT IS JUST SAD THE DISPLAY IS NOT TOUCHSCREEN CONTROL FOR ALL THOSE ARE JUST HORRIBLE AND HARD TO USE
THIS SYSTEM REMINDS ME OF DOS COMPARED TO WINDOWS THE IPHONE IS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE FOR NAVIGATION AND PHONE CALLS I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS STATED EARLIER IS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC
THE VEHICLES INTERNET CONNECTION SPEED IS UNACCEPTABLE IT IS SO SLOW AS TO BE UNUSABLE I AM VERY UPSET ABOUT IT
WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE TWO NAVIGATION BUTTONS ON DASH OR STEERING WHEEL 1 HOME BUTTON SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GO THRU MENUS AND 2 STOP GUIDANCE BUTTON FOR SAME REASON
HAVING A EXTREMELY HARD TIME WITH VOICE COMMAND
ALTHOUGH ONE CAN CHANGE STATIONS THAT ARE PROGRAMED WITH SIMPLE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS WHICH REQUIRE AN EXTRA SET HOME RADIO RATHER THAN SIMPLE CONTROLS PROGRAMING OR SCANNING STATION IS TOO COMPLICATED AND PROBABLY A SAFETY HAZARD IF DONE WHI
BECAUSE THE FAN RUNS ALL THE TIME THIS CREATES NOISE SO PHONE CALLS AND LISTENING TO MUSIC IS NOT AS GOOD AS IF THE RAN WAS NOT ON
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY AND YOU NEED TO MONITOR THE ROUTE FOR ACCURACY
I PREVIOUS EXPLAINED THE REASON FOR MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT DOES NOT GO DEEP ENOUGH IF YOU NOT IN A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT VOICE COMMUNICATION I QUIT USING IT PAIRING OF EXTERNAL EQUIPMENT SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE DONE MULTIPLE TIME MY OPINIO
VOICE RECOGNITION AND STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATION
I DON T LIKE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OTHER CARS GIVE YOU 3 ROUTES TO CHOOSE FROM MY CAR DOESN T GIVE ANY CHOICES
ALL BUTTONS ON DASH ARE ARE GREAT BUT THE KNOB CONTROL IS NOT GOOD THERE SHOULD BE A TOUCH SCREEN BUT PLEASE DO NOT GO ALL TOUCH SCREEN I HAVE AN ACURA THAT IS ALL TOUCH SCREEN AND I DO NOT LIKE IT
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
I M VERY SURPRISED THAT MERCEDES BENZ HAS NOT REALIZED THAT THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS MUCH TO SMALL FOR TODAY S STANDARDS AND ALMOST AN AFTER THOUGHT IN NAVIGATION IN TODAY S AGE IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN OPTION BUT SHOULD HAVE
WISH THE USB CORD WAS LONGER DOESN T CONNECT WELL
THE USE OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION PROGRAMING FOR THE NAVIGATION IS NOT RELIABLE THE HK RADIO IS ONLY AVERAGE IN TERMS OF SOUND QUALITY
NAVI IS NOT CONNECTING TO MY IPHONE ADDRESS BOOK AND WHEN I MANUALLY KEY IN ADDRESS IT TENDS TO BE OFF ON LOCATION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SOMEWHAT CONFUSING
NO NAVIGATION
VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR THUS DIFFICULT TO USE
NAVIGATING RADIO STATIONS IS TRULY ARCHAIC SO MUCH ROOM ON THE 8 DISPLAY SO LITTLE INFO NAVIGABILITY [SEE FORD LINCOLN MYTOUCH SYSTEM FOR GUIDE TO IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENT ] M B OPERATION SEEMS TO OPERATING DOS WHEREAS AN IPHONE LIKE IOS WOULD BE
THE MERCEDES COMMAND CENTER WORKS WELL BUT HAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS ESPECIALLY IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
VOICE COMMANDS
NAVIGATION SOMETIMES REQUIRES MULTIPLE VOICE COMMANDS FOR THE SAME COMMAND
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND VERY CONFUSING LOOSE TOTAL SOUND IN SOME AREAS WHILE LISTENING TO SIRIUS RADIO BUT IT DOESN T HAPPEN IN OUR OTHER CAR
PRETTY GOOD SOMETIMES A LITTLE HARD TO NAVIGATE WITH THE BUTTONS AND MAKING SURE YOU ARE PUSHING THE RIGHT ONES
HAVING 3 PLACES STEERING WHEEL TOUCH SCREEN AND DASHBOARD KNOBS TO PERFORM ANY ONE FUNCTION IS ALMOST OVERWHELMING TOO MANY CHOICES
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SEEMS OUT DATED FOR THE AREA I USE HAVE GONE TO WRONG LOCATIONS AND CLOSED LOCATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CLOSED FOR YEARS
MP3 PLAYER DISPLAY OF FILES AND SELECTIVITY OF THOSE FILES PLUS DELAY IN DOWNLOADING THOSE FILE COULD BE IMPROVED SWITCHING AMONG AM FM AUX IS LIMITED TO TOUCH SCREEN CAN T BE DONE USING CONSOLE KNOB
BLUETOOTH DOWNLOADING OF PHONE DATA WHICH FOR PRIVACY SECURITY REASONS IS NOT STORED IN THE CAR MUST BE DOWNLOADED EACH TIME THE PHONE IS PAIRED TO THE CAR DURING THIS SEVERAL MINUTE PROCESS THE BLUETOOTH MUSIC GENERAL CONNECTION AND PANDORA
USB MEMORY STICK DOES NOT REMEMBER LAST SONG OR WHERE IT WAS MID SONG TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT REALLY USEFUL WHEN YOU HAVE THE CONTROL KNOB IN THE CENTER CONSOLE AND CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL THE UPGRADE TO THE SYSTEM THE MAZDA 3 CURRENTLY HAS W
1 YR OF SATELLITE RADIO SHOULD BE INCLUDED
TOUCH SCREEN NOT SENSITIVE ENOUGH
TEXT MESSAGE DOWNLOAD FEATURE IS CUMBERSOME
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN PLACING CALLS DECREASE NUMBER OF STEPS NECESSARY TO PLACE A CALL QUALITY OF VOICE SOUND WHEN USING PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH MANUAL COMMANDER BUTTON IN CENTER IS REDUNDANT AND RARELY USED
I AM HAVING ISSUES WITH MY IPHONE 6 INTERACTING WITH THE AUDIO SYSTEM PERIODICALLY I VE ATTEMPTED TO HOOK THE DEVICE UP THROUGH THE USB CONNECTOR AND IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE THE DEVICE AT ALL WHEN I CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH I HAVE PERIODIC ISSUES
SHUFFLE IS DISABLED WHEN CONNECTING IPHONE 5 TO BLUETOOTH NOT SURE WHY
APPARENTLY MY VEHICLE S AUDIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE IPHONE SO WHILE THE VEHICLE DOES HAVE FEATURES SUCH AS READ COMPOSE TEXT MESSAGING I CANNOT UTILIZE THIS FEATURE BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WORK WITH MY PARTICULAR PHONE I SH
BETTER BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
THE VOICE COMMANDS
WOULD APPRECIATE A MULTI DISC CD PLAYER
COMPATIBILITY WITH I PHONE OPERATING SYSTEM IS AN ISSUE THE SYSTEM WILL NOT READ AND DISPLAY TEXTS
SYSTEM SHOULD BE MUCH FASTER TO LINK UP WITH BLUETOOTH ENABLED DEVICES
THE AUDIO WHEN USING HANDS FREE PHONE IS SOMETIMES MUFFLED AND THERE S A LOT OF EXTERNAL NOISES SO I CAN T HEAR THE OTHER PERSON ON THE PHONE SOMETIMES
WE OPTED FOR THE BASE AUDIO SYSTEM RATHER THAN THE THX AUDIO SYSTEM THE SOUND QUALITY ON THE BASE SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS VERY POOR ON AN OTHER WISE GREAT VEHICLE
INCLUDING A SINGLE CD PLAYER RATHER THAN A 6 CD CHANGER IS A WASTE
NAVIGATION NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE AND VOICE RECOGNITION IS FRUSTRATING WORDING HAS TO BE EXACT AND IN RIGHT ORDER AND CADENCE
VOICE RECOGNITION OF THE FEMALE VOICE SYSTEM RECOGNIZES THE DEEPER MALE VOICE ALL THE TIME SOFTER FEMALE VOICE SOME OF THE TIME
THE FORD SYNC SYSTEM IS NOT VERY GOOD IT S NOT OVERLY RESPONSIVE AND SOMETIMES DOESN T WORK CORRECTLY OR AS I VE STATED PREVIOUSLY DOESN T WORK AT ALL I BELIEVE FORD IS TRANSITIONING TO DIFFERENT SOFTWARE FOR THE SYSTEM SO I HAVE HIGHER HOPES
RADIO OFFERS HD CHANNELS SOUND QUALITY ISN T ANY GOOD SOUND FADES IN AND OUT HAD TO TURN OFF HD CAPABILITY
VERBAL COMMANDS TO THE AUDIO SYSTEM ARE NEVER INTERPRETED CORRECTLY NOT EVEN CLOSE
VOICE CONTROL
THE TOUCH SCREEN FORCES YOU TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD ACTUAL PRESS BUTTONS WOULDN T
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION HAS DOWNLOADED MY 1000+ CONTACTS AND WHEN I CONNECT THE PHONE IT RE DOWNLOADS THEM AGAIN I NEED TO DELETE THEM ALL AND START OVER I THINK THERE S MUCH MORE THAT THE SYSTEM CAN DO BUT I AM NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT YET
MORE ROBUST NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITH LARGER DISPLAY SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION REALLY DOES NOT WORK
NAVIGATION SYSTEM ALWAYS DEFAULTS TO FREEWAYS EXPRESSWAYS EVEN WHEN IT DOESN T MAKE SENSE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TOTALLY SUCKS I JUST GIVE UP IN FRUSTRATION AND USE GOOGLE MAPS ON MY IPHONE INSTEAD I WISH IT WAS AS EASY TO USE AS MY OLD GARMIN UNIT IDEALLY YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE IT WITHOUT CRACKING OPEN THE MANUAL
NAVIGATION MAKE IT MORE LIKE GOOGLE MAPS IT IS TRULY THE ONLY DESIGN FLAW DON T MAKE IT SO MANY STEPS TO CHANGE DEVICES ADD WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY LIKE A HOTSPOT ADD I HEART RADIO APPLICATION ADD A BROWSER FOR SEARCHING AND THEN ALLOW IT TO B
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SUBSTANDARD
SYSTEM WILL ASK IF I WANT TO DISPLAY NEW TEXT MESSAGES IF I CLICK YES IT SITS AT A DOWNLOADING SCREEN FOR SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE DISPLAYING CANNOT DOWNLOAD MESSAGE TRY AGAIN LATER IT HAS NEVER WORKED
REMOVE THE NAVIGATION LOCKOUT TO ALLOW PASSENGERS TO ENTER INFORMATION WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION MORE QUICKLY REMOVE THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO ETC INFORMATION THAT DISPLAYS IN THE UPPER LEFT OF THE SCREEN AFTER STARTING THE VEHICLE IT COVERS P
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN TRYING TO DIAL A CALL IS NOT GREAT
WITH THE ROAD NOISE THAT YOU HEAR IT S DIFFICULT TO HEAR THE RADIO OR TALK HANDS FREE UNLESS EVERYTHING IS TURNED UP THERE IS NO WAY TO TALK WITH THE SUNROOF OPEN
WHEN USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION CONTROLS THE SYSTEM SEEMS SLOW TO ACCEPT RESPONSES BUT I AM IMPRESSED WITH THE ACCURACY OF THE RECOGNITION EVEN WITH MULTIPLE ACCENTS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE USED IT I HAVE NOT YET USED THE BLUETOOTH
FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CUMBERSOME MUCH PERFER GARMIN
HAVE ALL CX 5 SATELLITE RADIO READY I TRADED IN A PT CRUISER AND I JUST ORDERED SIRUS THIS MAZADA WAS NOT SATELLITE READY THAT IS BS IN A 2015
I DON T HAVE NAVIGATION
ENABLE ZOOMING IN HD RADIO TRAFFIC DISPLAY
BETTER RELIABILITY IN CONNECTING PANDORA TO THE CAR
SAT NAV AND BLUETOOTH ARE BASIC THESE DAYS AND MAZDA IS NOT OFFERING IN THEIR BASE VARIANTS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE ROADS SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED IN COLORS MAKING IT MORE VISIBLE WHICH ROAD YOU ARE TRAVELING ON AND WHICH PATH YOU NEED TO FOLLOW IT S DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW THE MAP
NAVIGATOR VOICE RECOGNITION
PLEASE SEE PREVIOUS COMMENTS REGARDING BLUETOOTH ISSUE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO TRAIN BUT THE CONTROLS ARE SO EASY TO USE THAT I DO NOT USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION I USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION INSTEAD
ABILITY TO VARY PREFIXED RADIO CHANNELS
VERY HARD TO DEAL WITH CONNECTING IPHONE ESPECIALLY CAN T BE DONE WHILE DRIVING MORE OF AN ANNOYANCE TO LISTEN TO MY IPHONE BUTTONS ON THE SCREEN ARE ALSO SMALL
POWER OUTPUT OF AUDIO SYSTEM AS WELL AS QUALITY OF SPEAKERS USED
REMOVE REQUIREMENT TO PRESS PICK UP BUTTON TO MAKE A CALL NAVIGATION TO AUDIO CONTROLS TREBLE BASS ETC TAKES GETTING USED TO
SAFETY LOCK OUT FEATURE IS BOTHERSOME
VOICE RECOGNITION PROBLEMS MISINTERPRETS
THE SOUND QUALITY ESPECIALLY FOR BOSE SPEAKERS
THE CONTROL ARE VERY POORLY DESIGNED THE BUTTONS ARE TOO SMALL AND THE DISPLAY IS GENERIC LIKE OLD CRT COMPUTER TERMINAL THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE BLUETOOTH CALLS ARE VERY POOR
DOES NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOUND QUALITY OF SPEAKERS COULD BE IMPROVED
JOYSTICK AND PUSHBUTTON REQUIRED CANNOT LAUNCH SIRI WITHOUT GETTING MY PHONE OUT AND PHYSICALLY TOUCHING IT S HOME BUTTON CAR S BUILT IN VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM UNACCEPTABLY BAD AND OUT OF DATE SLOW AND HARD TO USE AND MAP
MOVE THE USB PORT TO AN EASIER TO USE LOCATION SUCH AS THE CENTER CONSOLE S STORAGE AREA OR JUST AN EASIER TO ACCESS ARE OF THE GLOVE BOX
MAKE IT LESS COMPLICATED BY USING BUTTONS INSTEAD OF DIALS OR A TOUCH CONTROL PROGRAM
DIFFICULTY WITH CONNECTING TO PHONE AND APPS HAS PREVENTED ME FROM USING EASILY
S BETTER DISPLAY FOR THE SAT RADIO STATIONS
SOUND QUALITY PLACEMENT OF THE USB PORT AND LOCATION OF THE REST FOR THE IPHONE
THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETUP AND USAGE ARE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND CONFUSING HOWEVER I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO HAVE THE DEALER EXPLAIN IT TO ME WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE AND THIS IS MY FIRST CAR WITH BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
MY LANCER SHOULD CAME WITH A NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAV IS HARD TO FIND SOME ADDRESSES NAV IS VERY HARD TO FIND LOCATIONS BY NAME GOOGLE MAPS IS MUCH BETTER TIME ESTIMATE TO DESTINATION IS INACCURATE GOOGLE MAPS IS MUCH MORE ACCURATE
LACKS SOME OF THE FEATURES I CURRENTLY HAVE ON A 12 YEAR OLD VEHICLE AREA RESERVED FOR THE RADIO FUNCTIONS IS MINI COMPARED TO THE LARGE SPEEDOMETER
EASIER PHONE CONNECTIVITY FOR MEDIA EASIER VIEW OF DETAILS ON AUDIO EASIER MENU FOR NAVIGATION
VOICE FEATURES ARE NEARLY USELESS I ONLY USE THE BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO ANSWER THE PHONE WHEN SOMEONE CALLS ME THE SOUND IS CRISP BUT VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY BAD AND NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY RECOMMEND THAT THE STOCK ROCKFORD FOSGATE S
WELL I CAN T BELIEVE FOR A IT DIDN T COME WITH THE HANDSFREE PHONE CAPABILITY EVERYTHING FOR AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE
MOVE THE RADIO BUTTON VOLUME CONTROL TO THE DRIVER S SIDE PLAY BLUETOOTH PHONE CALLS THROUGH MORE THAN 1 SPEAKER
WHEN YOU HIT THE VOICE COMMAND ON THE STEER WHEEL IT DOESN T PICK UP THE VOICE RECONICTION AND IT IS HARD TO FIND IT ON THE DASH OF THE RADIO CONTROL IT S SUPPOSE TO BE HANDS FREE AND EASY TO USE BUT WHEN IT DOESN T WORK ON THE STEER WWHEEL IT S
PLACEMENT OF USB
ALTHOUGH THE IPHONE 6 HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR SOME TIME MINI HAS NOT BOTHERED TO MAKE A COMPATIBLE ADAPTER FOR THE ARMREST HOLDER THAT I PAID EXTRA FOR WHEN PURCHASING THE CAR THIS MEANS I CANNOT LISTEN TO MUSIC OR AUDIOBOOKS BEYOND THE PHONE BA
LOOSE CONNECTION IN USB PORT
RECEIVING PHONE CALL WHILE DRIVING AND LISTENING TO PANDORA OFF MY CELL PHONE ONCE HANGING UP ON PHONE CALL THERE ARE TIMES THE MUSIC FROM PANDORA DOES DOT COME BACK ON NEED TO PLAY WITH PHONE OR SHUT SYSTEM OFF IN CAR AND WAIT UNTIL IT RESETS
INSTRUCTIONS NEED IMPROVEMENT AND USEFUL OF NAV SYSTEM
INITIALLY VERY UNHAPPY WITH LACK OF BUILT IN SATELITE RADIO RECEIVER AS WITH PREVIOUS MINI THEN VERY UNHAPPY WITH DIFFICULTY USING PHONE TO ACCESS EITHER INTERNET RADIO OR SUBSCRIBED SIRIUS RADIO PARING AS BEEN DIFFICULT AND SPOTTY AT BEST AND N
SOMETIMES THE BLUETOOTH GPS FROM A SMARTPHONE INTERRUPTS RADIO EVEN WHEN THERE ARE NO IMMINENT DIRECTIONS FROM GPS APP
CONTROLS OF THE STANDARD RADIO ARE HARD TO USE NOT VERY INTUITIVE NO VOICE CONTROL BUT STEERING WHEEL HAS THE VOICE CONTROL BUTTON YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC FROM IPHONE WHEN CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH WHY DO YOU NEED SUCH AN EXPENSIVE
I STRUGGLE WITH THE CONNECTION OF MY IPHONE I HAVE SPECIFIED THE ISSUE IN ANOTHER COMMENT
VOLUME CONTROL COULD BE BETTER AS WELL AS THE CONNECTIONS FOR OTHER THAN APPLE DEVICES WOULD BE HELPFUL
NOT EASY TO USE HANDS FREE FOR PHONE DOESN T ALWAYS WORK DIFFICULT FOR OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE HANDS FREE PHONE SYSTEM IMPROVED IT DOESN T ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THE COMMANDS THAT I AM CHOSING OR THE PERSON THAT I AM WANTING TO CALL FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I ASK FOR ANDREW T WHICH IS MY SON IT WILL GIVE ME ANDREW F WHICH IS
TRYING TO FIND THE LOCATION YOU WANT TO GO TO THREW THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM IS CONFUSING
DON T HAVE NAVIGATION IN MY MODEL
IF MY LIGHTS ARE ON DURING THE DAY THE AUDIO SCREEN IS HARD TO SEE SCAN FEATURE IS HARD TO ACCESS NEED BETTER MANUAL FOR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
NAVIGATION MENU SEEMS CUMBERSOME
IPOD CONNECTION DOES NOT ALLOW MUSIC TO BE PLAYED ONLY ALLOWS A CHARGE NOT ACCEPTABLE TO NOT BE ABLE TO USE A FEATURE ON A BRAND NEW VEHICLE
HAVE AUDIO FROM PHONE NAVIGATION PLAY OVER BLUETOOTH
HANDS FREE PHONE QUALITY SUCKS POOR QUALITY OF THE DRIVER TO THE OTHER LISTENER USB PORT IS IN A STUPID LOCATION
WHEN THE IPOD IS CONNECTED THERE IS NO WAY TO PAUSE A SONG WITHOUT TURNING OFF SOUND SYSTEM OR SWITCHING TO OTHER SOURCE ALSO WHEN YOU TURN THE CAR OFF THE LAST SONG BEING PLAYED ON THE IPOD IS NOT THE ONE PLAYING WHEN YOU RETURN
USB SHOULD BE BOTH USB PORT AND CABLE CORD
THE ONE THING I THINK CAN T BE CONTROLLED BUT THAT I DON T LIKE IS WHEN I HAVE THE STATION SET TO HD IT FREQUENTLY GOES IN AND OUT OF HD CAUSING THE SONG SKIP YOU CAN TELL I M OLD AND REMEMBER RECORDS
WHY DOES IT COST MORE TO GET A BETTER & EASIER TO USE AUDIO SYSTEM
I DON T OWN A NAVIGATION SYSTEM EVERYTHING ELSE IS FINE
VOICE COMMANDS RARELY WORK PROPERLY
THE APPS TAKE TOO LONG TO LOAD OFTENTIMES I CAN PULL MY IPHONE OUT OF MY POCKET AND PULL UP THE WEATHER AND PUT IT BACK IN MY POCKET WHILE THE ONBOARD APP IS STILL DISPLAYING THE CONNECTING MESSAGE ADDITIONALLY THE MUSIC REGISTER WHILE A
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN THE STEERING WHEEL IS ANNOYING IT IS VERY SENSITIVE AND TURNS ON SOMETIMES WHEN I STEER REALLY STARTLED ME THE FIRST TIME SINCE I DIDN T KNOW WHAT IT WAS NOW JUST ANNOYING WHEN IT COMES ON WHILE I M STEERING
GET SURROUND SOUND AND BOSE SPEAKERS
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ONLY USEFUL ON STRAIGHT ROADS TURNING WHEEL RENDERS IT USELESS THEN MUST USE CENTER CONTROLS WHICH ARE TOO DISTRACTING FROM DRIVING CAN STEERING WHEEL CONTROL BE MADE SEPARATE AND STATIONARY NON TURNING IN SAME LOCATIO
EASIER ACCESS TO YOUR CELL PHONE CONTACT LIST VIA THE BLUETOOTH FOR DIALING OUTGOING CALLS
IT COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE SOME OF THE CONTROLS REQUIRE MULTIPLE STEPS TO GET TO WHAT YOU RE LOOKING FOR EX NAVIGATION HAVING BASIC COMMANDS FOR DIFFERENT USES ALL ON ONE DASHBOARD WOULD MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND VOICE CONTROLS AREN T GR
VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE COULD BE IMPROVED AND MADE MORE ACCURATE AND ALSO LESS DRY AND IMPERSONAL
THE USB PORT FOR THE IPOD IS HARD TO REACH PLUS I HAVE OLD IPODS AND THE SYSTEM OFFERS LIMITED NAVIGATION OF THE DEVICES
THE IPOD CONNECTIVITY ISSUES THAT I MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS COMMENTS TO ME THE LACK OF PERFORMANCE WITH THE SYSTEMS IPOD CAPABILITY IS UNACCEPTABLE
MY LAST VEHICLE HAD SATELITE RADIO SATELITE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUILD IN THE DASH PHONE SYSTEM AND I PAID LESS FOR IT
SOUND QUALITY POOR
SOUND QUALITY FAIR WHEN USING BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE CALLS
DISPLAY OF THE SYSTEM AND CONTROLLING OF THE SYSTEM ADD MORE THAN 10 PROGRAMMABLE RADIO STATIONS I LIVE IN A METRO CITY AREA 14 TO 15 PRE SETS WOULD BE GOOD VS THE CURRENT 10
REMOVE TOUCH SCREEN
I REALLY WISH I COULD CONNECT THE IPOD USING THE USB CORRECTLY
I WISH I HAD SATELLITE SERVICE TOO
FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY I PAID $42 000 THIS VEHICLE SHOULD COME WITH XM RADIO AND THE DISPLAY IS VERY BASIC THE SPEAKERS ARE BASIC AS WELL SHOULD COME WITH AT LEAST BOSE
ALLOW PHONE TO PLAY MUSIC FROM USB
SO MUCH ROAD NOISE I CAN HARDLY HEAR THE OTHER PERSON ON THE BLUETOOTH & UNABLE TO TURN UP LOUDER SO I CAN HEAR IT
AUDIO SHOULD BE MUCH BETTER SOUNDING CONSIDERING IT S A BOSE OPTION COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS UNECESSARILY COMPLEX DIFFICULT TO USE CHOOSING CHANNELS FOR AUDIO IS UNECESSARILY COMPLEX
COMPLETE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE NOT JUST FOR CALLING PURPOSES
I HAVE NO SUGGESTIONS WE PURCHASED A BASIC MODEL WE ONLY DRIVE THE CAR ON WEEKEND TRIPS WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THE CAR AND IT ADDRESSES ALL OUR NEEDS
NO HAS NAV SYSTEM
DIFFICULT TO GET IPHONE CONTACTS TO BE RECOGNIZED AND STORED
NAVIGATION INITIAL SCREEN IS REQUIRED READING AND DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY ADVANCE TO THE NEXT SCREEN
NEEDS BETTER SOUND SYSTEM AND BLUTOOTH CONNECTIVITY
USB LOCATION
WINDOWS PHONE COMPATIBLE
THE AUDIO SYSTEM SEEMS CHEAP LOW QUALITY IT WORKS BUT NOT GREAT
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK TO SEND A TEXT OR EMAIL THERE ARE MANY STEPS TO MAKING A VOICE RECOGNITION PHONE CALL COULD BE EASIER FLIPPING THROUGH RADIO STATIONS SHOULD ALLOW FOR GOING ACROSS ALL PRESETS NOT JUST THE SOURCE YOUR IN FM1
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS FOR EASE HOW TO SET UP NAVIGATION BETTER QUALITY BLUETOOTH SOUND
THE VOICE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR PHONE CALLS
HEN TRYING TO FIND A PLACE TO EAT IT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD NOT WORK WHEN THE VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION SO WE HAD TO STOP IN ORDER TO USE IT IF SOMEONE IS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT IT WOULD BE HANDY TO ALLOW IT TO WORK
THE AUDIO SOUNDS CHEAP NEED BETTER SPEAKERS OR MORE WATTAGE FROM STEREO
SATELLITE RADIO WAS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE CAR VERY MUCH MISSED
SIRIUS XM SHOULD NOT BE A STANDARD FEATURE THERE SHOULD NOT BE A DEDICATED BUTTON FOR SIRIUS INSTEAD THAT BUTTON SHOULD BE USED TO SELECT BETWEEN AM & FM
THE SPEAKERS NEED BE A BETTER QUALITY FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM CD RADIO
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY RUNNING DVD PLAYER THROUGH SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION IS SPOTTY I AM STILL TRYING TO USE USB CONNECTION CAN T TELL IF IT S USER ERROR OR NOT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY AND ALLOW FOR A PASSENGER TO USE IT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT ACCURATE
THE INTERFACE ON SCREEN COULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE PERHAPS WITH MORE PRESETS ON HOME PAGE STEERING WHEEL SHOULD BE ABLE TO TUNE AUDIO PRESETS EASILY IN CAR APPS ARE MORE COMPLEX THAN NEEDED
GLARE REFLECTION FROM THE VIDEO SCREEN AT NIGHT IS ANNOYING
NO USB PORT AS SUCH PISSED OFF WITH THE SYSTEM
IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WERE EASIER TO SWITCH BETWEEN CONNECTED PHONES I HAVE A WORK AND PERSONAL PHONE AND MAKE CALLS THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH ON BOTH BUT IT IS A MULTI PART PROCESS TO SWITCH CONNECTED PHONES
THE NISSAN CONNECT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK AT ALL I TRIED IT A FEW TIMES AND JUST ENDED UP FRUSTRATED I DO LIKE THE BLUETOOTH LINK TO THE IPOD ON MY PHONE THOUGH
CONTROLS FOR PHONE AUDIO OR EXTERNAL FLASH DRIVES ARE SOMETIMES REVERSE DEPENDING ON HOW DISPLAYED UP IS FORWARD AND DOWN IS BACKWARD NISSAN HAS IT AS UP BACKWARDS AND DOWN FORWARD
THE SYNCING OF BLUETOOTH HANDS FREE CALLLING
MAYBE I JUST DON T KNOW HOW TO USE IT BUT RUN MY IPOD THROUGH AN AUDIO JACK AND I PLUG INTO A USB FROM THE ACCESSORY OUTLET TO KEEP IT CHARGED I WISH I COULD JUST PLUG MY IPOD INTO A PORT ON THE DASHBOARD
PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT THEY CAN T HEAR ME WHEN I TALK USING THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
THE SCREEN RESOLUTION LOOKS REALLY CHEAP AND POOR QUALITY IT ALMOST HAD ME BUYING THE TOYOTA THE TECH IS WAY BEHIND TOYOTA
ABILITY TO CONTROL ANDROID CELL PHONE AUDIO FILES THROUGH USB PORT
APPS DON T WORK DIFFICULT TO ACTIVATE TRIED AND TRIED WON T RECOGNIZE MY OWNERSHIP SO I DON T USE THEM
I AM SOMEWHAT OLD SCHOOL AND HAVE NOT USED A LOT OF THE TECH FEATURES OF VEHICLE BUT WILL SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE GIVE IT A SHOT
TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS NOT EASILY MANAGED WHILE DRIVING
THE NISSAN CONNECT APP IS VERY HARD TO USE AND I HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING IT TO WORK
THE SYSTEM IS OUTDATED MANY OTHER VEHICLES HAVE BETTER TOUCH SCREEN AUDIO AND NAV SYSTEMS AVAILABLE FOR THE PRICE PAID
BETTER AUDIO WITH SMART PHONES MOST CALLS SOUND GARBLED OR HOLLOW I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE WAZE AS AN APP ON MY CAR
BLUETOOTH AND THE AUDIO LADY REPEATING STUFF BACK TO U DOESN T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT U ARE SAYING AT TIMES AND CANT LOCATE WHO U R CALLING
THE NISSANCONNECT APP IS VERY POOR I HAVE HAD TO STOP THE CAR AND RESTART EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY APPS DON T LOAD MOST OF THE TIME AND IT WILL GET STUCK ON THE LOADING SCREEN
NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE ONE AS A FEATURE THAT COMES WITH THE CAR
TOO MANY FUNCTIONS ON A SINGLE TOUCHSCREEN TRYING TO ACCOMMODATE NAVIGATION CLIMATE ENTERTAINMENT AND ENERGY CONSUMPTION
WHEN USING BLUETOOTH FROM MY PHONE THE VEHICLE WILL PLAY ALL MUSIC ON MY PHONE AND NOT JUST A PLAYLIST THAT I HAVE CHOSEN WE HAVE A TOYOTA AND ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IT SHOWS YOUR PLAYLISTS AND WILL LET YOU SELECT THE ONE THAT YOU WANT TO PLAY
TAKES APPROXIMATELY 4 TO 5 MINUTES BEFORE SYSTEM WILL LINK TO THE SMART PHONES PANDORA OR I HEART RADIO DELAY COULD BE REDUCED OR ELIMINATED SEVERAL ATTEMPTS ARE REQUIRED TO CONNECT TO I HEART
LARGER DISPLAY SPACE FOR FM STATION INFO OR CUSTOMIZABLE DISPLAY PICK MULTIPLE SCREENS TO ARRANGE AND DISPLAY SIMULTANEOUSLY
ONLY WHAT I HAD MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THE NAVIGATION NOT HAVING A CANCEL OPTION WHEN GIVING DIRECTIONS
NAVIGATION IS AWFUL JUST LICENSE GARMIN & GIVE US WHAT WE WANT INSTEAD OF TRYING TO RE INVENT THE WHEEL AND MAKE US LEARN A NEW SYSTEM THAT IS INFERIOR TO AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN THE FIELD
SOMETIMES THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND SMART PHONE CONNECT CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE A WARNING POPS UP AND SAYS THE SD CARD MUST BE INSERTED THE SD CARD IS ALWAYS IN THE CAR IN ORDER TO CLEAR THE WARNING I HAVE TO REMOVE THE SD CARD AND REINSERT IT S
I WOULD LIKE THE RADIO BETTER IF I COULD BLUETOOTH MUSIC FROM MY PHONE RATHER THAN HAVING TO TETHER WITH AN AUX CORD I USE THE USB PORT TO CHARGE MY PHONE BUT DO NOT USE THE IPOD PLAYING FEATURES BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE MUSIC SAVED TO MY PHONE I
ELECTRIC CARS WITH LIMITED RANGE DON T NEED AS MANY MUSIC OPTIONS OR APPS BECAUSE YOU CAN T DRIVE THE CAR LONG ENOUGH TO GET BORED
TEXT MESSAGES COULD BE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN FROM THE IPHONE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK BUT DOESN T
EASIER TO INPUT A LOCATION FOR ROUTE GUIDANCE ALSO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE A TEXT ON THE SYSTEM
ALTHOUGH THE INTERIOR NOISE LEVELS OF THE JUKE ARE BETTER THAN PRIOR MODEL YEARS THE BACKGROUND DRIVING NOISE INTERFERES WITH THE AUDIO QUALITY OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM
I LISTEN TO PODCASTS REGULARLY WHILE DRIVING SYSTEM DOES FAIR JOB OF LOCATING PODCASTS ON PHONE BUT DOESN T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO START THEM FROM THE SYSTEMS CONTROLS RATHER IT TENDS TO PULL UP SYSTEM SETTINGS INSTEAD
SOMETIMES DOES NOT SYNCH WITH IPHONE SMOOTHLY
I HAVE TO ALMOST YELL TO BE HEARD WHEN I AM MAKING A PHONE CALL VIA BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
SUPPORT FOR BLUETOOTH AUDIO NEEDED FIX BUGGY IPOD USB INTERFACE FROM FREEZING THE AUDIO COMPUTER
MICROPHONE AND OR SOFTWARE BETTER AT UNDERSTANDING THE DIAL PERSON NAME COMMAND
SOMETIMES AFTER CONNECTING IPOD OR IPHONE THE STEREO CAN T READ IT ALSO SIRIUSXM FAILS SAYS CHANNELS ARE UNAVAILABLE PRETTY GOOD OVERALL BUT BUGGY
NOTHING IN THIS NEWER MODEL THE VOICE RECOGNITION BUGS I HAD IN MY MODEL HAVE BEEN CORRECTED & THE BOISE AUDIO IS BEYOND WORDS FOR SOUND QUAILTY
I DON T KNOW IF I DON T HAVE IS SET UP CORRECTLY OR IF I DON T KNOW HOW TO USE IT BUT I HAVE HAD A HARD TIME WITH THE NAVIGATION ALL TOGETHER IT IS NOT EASY TO PUT PLACES I WANT TO GO IN WITHOUT HAVING TO START ALL OVER AT LEAST TWICE MAKING O
I RARELY USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BECAUSE IT S TOO DIFFICULT TO USE I CAN NEVER GET IT TO TAKE AN ADDRESS CERTAIN NUMBERS AND LETTERS ARE BLOCKED OUT AND I CAN T GET IT TO TAKE AN ENTIRE ADDRESS THE POINTS OF INTEREST FEATURE ISN T APPEALING
BEING ABLE TO ADJUST THINGS WITH A KNOB IS BETTER THAN A TOUCH SCREEN OR VOICE
ADD BLUETOOTH STEREO AUDIO STREAMING TO THE BASE MODEL LEAF
THE NAVIGATION IS CONFUSING AT TIMES AND DIFFICULT TO CHANGE
THE INTEGRATION WITH APPLE IPHONE COULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED THE CAPABILITIES ARE RUDIMENTARY AT BEST EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE OFFERS TEXT READING AND SENDING THAT FEATURES ONLY WORKS WITH ANDROID DEVICES GOOD THING I WASN T DEPENDING ON THAT
VOICE COMMAND RECOGNITION SUCKS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WILL NOT ALLOW UPDATES TO DESTINATION UNLESS VEHICLE IS PARKED THIS PREVENTS PASSENGER FROM ENTERING NEW INFORMATION I UNDERSTAND THE REASONING STUPID IS AS STUPID DOES BUT SURELY THE DRIVER CAN MAKE THESE DECISIONS B
THE INTERFACE COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER NISSAN MADE FALSE ADVERTISING AGAINST CONNECTED APPS SINCE MANY OF THE APPS ADVERTISED ARE STILL NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE MODELS WITH NAVIGATION
NAV SYSTEM COULD BE EASIER TO USE MORE INTUITIVE
BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH PHONE
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
I HAVE AN IPHONE 6 NISSANCONNECT DOESN T SEEM TO BE TOTALLY COMPATIBLE WITH THIS EXTREMELY COMMON PHONE VERY SURPRISING AND DISAPPOINTING WHEN UNABLE TO SEND TEXT APPEARS WHEN TRYING TO SEND CANNED RESPONSE
EDITING THE NAMES OF DESTINATIONS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AS PART OF THE ENTRY WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR A STREET ADDRESS RIGHT NOW YOU NEED TO GO TO A DIFFERENT SET OF MENUS TO DO THIS TOOK A LOT OF DIGGING INTO THE MANUALS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS
NEEDS A BETTER DISPLAY LOCATION SHOWING YOU HOW FAR AND TIME TO DESTINATION HARD TO SEE WHILE DRIVING
GIVE WRITTEN DIRECTIONS FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM POINT BY POINT
THE VOLUME CONTROL IS ON THE LEFT AND THE STATION TUNER IS ON THE RIGHT I HAVE TO REACH ALL THE WAY OVER JUST TO CHANGE A RADIO STATION WOULD BE NICE IF THEY WERE SWITCHED
IT SHOULD WORK WITH IPHONE REGARDLESS OF HOW APPLE STANDARDIZES THEIR DEVICES OTHER CAR MAKERS DO IT THEY SHOULD TOO
NISSAN CONNECT DOES NOT WORK WELL SHOULD INTEGRATE BETTER WITH IPHONE AND APPEARS TO BE SLOW
YOU NEED TO START OVER I HOPE I CAN GET A FREE UPGRADE DOESN T WORK WITH AN IPHONE REALLY THE SYSTEM IS JUST PLAIN AWFUL I WOULD RETURN THE CAR ON THIS ALONE WHEN IS APPLE ICAR COMING THE SYSTEM IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IPHONE AT ALL AND TAKE
I HAVE NOT USED ANY SYSTEMS OTHER THAN RADIO AND HANDS FREE PHONE
SOUND QUALITY IS AFFECTED BY OUTSIDE INSIDE ROAD NOISE PRIOR AUTO LINCOLN RODE MUCH QUIETER
I DONE KNOW WHAT OTHER APPS I CAN GET BESIDES GOOGLE WHEN MY PHONE IS CONNECTED NOT VERY USEFUL OR EASY TO NAVIGATE WHEN DRIVING
WHEN WI FI IS TURNED ON IN YOUR SMARTPHONE IT MAKES THE RADIO IPOD PLAYER SKIP SLOW DOWN OR HAS STATIC
RELOCATED TH USB PORT
NISSANCONNECT APPS DIFFICULT TO SET UP AND USE
THE NISSANCONNECT SYSTEM APPS SEEMS TO BE A WASTE SEEMS THAT RELATIVELY FEW ARE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING MORE THAN GOOGLE SEARCH TO WORK NONE OF THE OTHER APPS WORK MAYBE THEY DO NOW BUT I HAVE ALREADY MOVED ON WITH BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY I AM N
I WISHED THE NAVIGATION WAS A LITTLE EASIER TO USE SEEMS A LITTLE COMPLICATED WISHED THE RADIO STATIONS SOUNDED AS GOOD AS THE IPOD OR CD PLAYER
BE ABLE TO PLAY PANDORA
ALLOW PASSENGER TO ENTER ADDRESS INTO NAVIGATION
THE PLAYING MODE DISPLAY FOR MUSIC ON A FLASH DRIVE SHOULD SHOW THE FILENAME NOT JUST THE METADATA OF THE FILE
I HAVE USED GARMIN NúVI NAVIGATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE EASE OF ENTERING DESTINATION INFORMATION AND THE VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN WHILE NAVIGATING ARE BETTER THAN WHAT THE BUILT IN MB NAVIGATION SYSTEM DELIVERS ALSO I FIND THAT THE MAP INFO D
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT IDEAL RECEIVING TEXT AND SENDING TEXT WOULD HELP GREATLY NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE MORE LIKE GARMIN
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND
VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR ESPECIALLY WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A PHONE CALL I DO NOT USE IT FOR RADIO OR NAVIGATION
NAV SYSTEM SOMETIMES NOT VERY RESPONSIVE TO VOICE COMMANDS
I VE USED OTHER NAVIGATION SYSTEMS WHERE THE DISPLAYS ARE WITH BETTER CLARITY THE VISUALS WERE DESIGNED WITH MORE DETAIL THE KNOB TO TURN BETWEEN FUNCTIONS I FIND MORE DIFFICULT TO USE THAN A TOUCH SCREEN OPERATION
NAVIGATION AND AUDIO SYSTEMS SEEM A LITTLE OUT OF DATE AND COULD BE A BIT MORE MODERN BUT WORKS WELL OVER ALL BUT THE UX AND UI INTERFACE COULD BE BETTER
I LIKE IT IT IS TAKING A LONG TIME TO LEARN ALL THE FEATURES AND SOMETIME IT IS HARD TO GET THINGS LIKE THE APPS AND WEATHER TO CONNECT
SOFTWARE FOR APPLICATIONS SHOULD NOT COST EXTRA TO HAVE DOWNLOADED INTO VEHICLE
VOICE COMTROL TOUCH SCREEN CONTROL
I FIND THE VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM CLOSE TO USELESS IT NEVER UNDERSTANDS MY VOICE NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER AND THE COMMANDS ARE TOO COMPLICATED
HAVE SEEN BETTER MAPS ON NAVIGATION SYSTEMS THAN THE ONE WE HAVE
DISPLAY IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND ESPECIALLY SWITCHING BETWEEN FM AND SATELLITE RADIO
I THINK I WOULD PREFER TOUCH SCREEN ON THE WHOLE SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO TELL ME THE STREET NAME THAT I NEED TO TURN ON INSTEAD OF PREPARE TO TURN LEFT OR RIGHT AND GIVE PLENTY OF TIME BEFORE THE COMMAND
THE CONTROLS FOR PLAYING MUSIC ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND SWITCHING BETWEEN SATELLITE AND FM RADIO IS CONFUSING
POINTS OF INTEREST NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO USE
WISH I HAD THE TOUCH SCREEN NONE AVAILABLE WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR
NAVIGATION ROUTES SHOULD BE IMPROVED
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD BE IMPROVED
THE VOICE COMMAND DOES NOT WORK IN THE VEHICLE WHICH IS STUPID WHY IS IT INSTALLED IF IT IS NOT GOING TO WORK
VOICE RECOGNITION IS REALLY SUB PAR EVERYTHING ELSE IS AMAZING I DON T USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION MUCH BUT WHEN I DO IT S REALLY A HASSLE
SOMRTIMES THE BLUETOOTH DOESNT CONNECT
SIRIUS RADIO NOT AVAILABLE IN HAWAII YET CHARGED FOR IT
GO DRIVE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO MUSIC ON PHONE MUSIC IS NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE WITH THE HARMON KARDEN UNIT NOT VERY LOUD
MAKE A NICE ADD ON NAVIGATION UNIT
IT IS DIFFICULT TO PRE SELECT RADIO STATIONS RE SET THE CLOCK WITH TIME CHANGES USUALLY I CAN FIGURE THESE THINGS BUT I FOUND THE MINI TO BE SOMEWHAT COUNTERINTUITIVE
MAKING PHONE CALLS IS AWKWARD SINCE I HAVE TO LOOK AT MY PHONE AND PUNCH IN THE CONTACT TO CALL THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM
THERE IS SOMETIMES A DELAY WHEN USING BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE CALLS
THE NAVIGATION AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS SURVEY IT HAS ISSUES AND NEEDS MAJOR IMPROVEMENT ALL AROUND I EXPECTED MORE IN THIS AREA FROM A CAR MADE BY BMW
THE USB AUX PORT DIFFICULT TO USE ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING BLUETOOTH TO SMART PHONES SHOULD BE STANDARD AND NOT AN OPTION
VOICE ACTIVATION WOULD BE A HUGE BENEFIT
THE VOICE RECOGNITION LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED IT ISN T VERY RESPONSIVE AND IT TAKES TOO MANY STEPS TO ACCOMPLISH MY ACTION ALSO THE APPS BUILT INTO THE MEDIA SYSTEM ARE PRACTICALLY UNUSABLE BECAUSE THE DATA CONNECTION IS TYPICALLY UNSTABLE
THE INTERIOR DESIGN PANEL OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM COULD USE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT
VOICE COMMANDS TOO FREQUENTLY MISUNDERSTOOD BY SYSTEM
I HAVEN T HAD TO USE THE NAVIGATION YET SO I CAN T GIVE YOU FURTHER DETAILS THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR USING THE PHONE BOOK COULD BE BETTER IT SOMETIMES DRAWS UP A NAME THAT SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE I SAID
THERE SHOULD BE A SOUND INDICATOR IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AT THE POINT AT WHICH YOU SHOULD TURN I FOUND THIS HELPFUL IN MY HAND HELD NAVIGATION SYSTEM
IT NEEDS A JUKEBOX LIKE MY F 250
IT MAY BE THAT I AM JUST USE TO ANOTHER SYSTEM HOWEVER I FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT VERY EASY TO USE
EVERY TIME I USE THE BLUETOOTH TO MAKE A PHONE CALL I FEEL I HAVE TO YELL IN ORDER TO GET THE PERSON ON THE LINE TO HEAR
THE BLUETOOTH WOULD BE BETTER IF IT PLAYED MY MUSIC FROM MY PHONE
SOUND QUALITY OF THE BLUETOOTH PHONE
POSSIBLY RELOCATING THE MICROPHONE SO THAT IT IS CLOSER TO AND MORE IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER
CAN T PLAY YOUR PHONE MUSIC CAUSE IT DOESN T HAVE INTERNET CONNECTION BUILD IN AND NO NAVIGATION SYSTEMS UNLESS YOU ARE GETTING OFF YOUR CELL PHONE
THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT ITS HARD TO HEAR THE CALLER I HAVE TO SHOUT FOR THE CALLER TO HEAR ME MOST OF THE TIME WHAT I SAY IS UNCLEAR I HAVE STOPPED USING THE BLUETOOTH DEVICE
ALL THESE QUESTIONS DO NOT APPLY TO ME I DO NOT LISTEN TO MUSIC IN THE CAR AND MY CELL PHONE IS NOT LINKED TO THE VEHICLE I ONLY RATED A 6 SINCE THERE IS NOT A N A CHOICE
UNABLE TO HOOK UP IPOD AND PLAY EASILY
I HAVE HAD NO LUCK IN TRYING TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO PARK THE CAR TO PUT IN THE ADDRESS YOU ARE ALREADY PASSED YOUR TURN BEFORE IT SAYS TO TURN
THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE A LITTLE EASIER TO NAVIGATE THROUGH
I CAN CONNECT MY PHONE TO BLUETOOTH AND EASILY MAKE HANDS FREE CALLS HOWEVER I STILL CAN T FIGURE OUT IF I CAN PLAY MUSIC OVER BLUETOOTH
VOICE ACTIVATION RECOGNITION
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS IN THE MANUAL ON THE NAV SYSTEM
BETTER SOUND QUALITY WOULD BE A PLUS
SOUND QUALITY THROUGH THE SPEAKERS IS VERY POOR ALSO MOST PEOPLE CAN T UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TRY TO USE THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM TO MAKE AND ANSWER PHONE CALLS
NEVER USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET ONLY 2000 MILES SO FAR
THE NISSAN APP NEEDS IMPROVED ON
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY SET UP SHOULD BE EASIER SHORT ON SCREEN DIRECTIONS WOULD BE HELPFUL
IF THE CLARITY OF OUTGOING PHONE CALLS WERE IMPROVED SOMEHOW REMOVING THE TIN CAN SOUND OF THE PHONE SYSTEM
WHILE DRIVING MY PASSENGER CANNOT ENTER DATA INTO THE GPS SYSTEM WHICH IS A CONCERN BECAUSE I CANNOT SIMPLY JUST STOP IN THE MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC TO INPUT INFO INTO THE GPS SYSTEM
DIFFICULT TO SEARCH SATELLITE STATIONS DIFFICULT TO TUNE SATELLITE STATIONS WITH STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
THE SPEAKER FOR THE BLUETOOTH NEEDS TO BE BIGGER THE 2 SMALL HOLES ARE NOT BIG ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE HAVING A PROBLEM HEARING ME WHEN I AM TALKING WITH THEM
NEED 6 CHANGE CD PLAYER & BETTTER NAME BRAND SOUNG SYSTEM & SPEAKERS IN THE XTERRA ALSO NEED TO GO TO TOUCH SCREEN
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS COULD BE SLEEKER THEY STICK OUT A BIT TO FAR AND CAN BE HIT BY ACCIDENT WHILE TURNING
MAKE THE ROCKFORD FOSGATE OR BOSE SYSTEM AVAILABLE FOR THE 2WHEEL DRIVE MODEL ALSO THE
THE OVERALL VOLUME OF PHONE CALLS OVER BLUETOOTH COULD BE INCREASED
I AM PERSONALLY OPPOSED TO HAVING DISTRACTING TECH FEATURES IN A CAR EXCEPT FOR A EMERGENCY CELL PHONE AND RADIO
GRAPHIC EQUALIZER INSTEAD OF BASIC AUDIO FUNCTIONS WOULD ENHANCE SOUND QUALITY
I HAVE NO NAVIGATION THATS THE DOWN FALL AND WHEN I USE THE BLU TOOTH OPTION NOBODY CAN EVER HEAR ME
SOUNDS AND VOICE QUALITY FOR HANDSFREE CALLING
TOUCH SCREEN BUTTONS ARE SMALL AND CLOSE TOGETHER GIVEN THE CAR S TIGHT SUSPENSION SYSTEM IT IS OFTEN HARD TO PUSH THE CORRECT BUTTON WHILE DRIVING THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN SHIFTING FROM AM RADIO TO FM TO XM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM INPUT FOR DIRECTIONS IS CLUMSY AND DIFFICULT TO USE
SUBARU COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB ON THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM
IT IS DIFFICULT TO ENTER ADDRESSES INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR PLACES OUTSIDE OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA THAT YOU ARE IN
SPEECH RECOGNITION IS HARD TO THE POINT I JUST GAVE UP
NAVIGATION VERY SLOW
THE NAVIGATION AUTO PREDICTION MAKES FOR AN AGGRAVATING INPUT NEVER HAVING THE OPTIONS I WANT SO I USUALLY JUST USE THE MAPS APP FUNCTION ON MY ANDROID SMART PHONE IF I NEED HELP GOING WHERE I M GOING I LL PUT THE MAP ON MY SCREEN IF I M TRYING
ALLOW AUX CABLE TO NOT GET DISCONNECTED THROUGH RADIO
I HAVE NO COMMENT ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS I HAVE NOT TRIED TO USE IT YET I HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT THE SPEAKER SYSTEM IT SEEMS I CAN ONLY GET EITHER THE FRONT OR THE BACK SPEAKERS NOT BOTH IN VARYING DEGREES
EASE OF USE WITH HANDS FREE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM POINTS OF INTEREST LANDMARKS SAVED ADDRESSES ETC REALLY NEEDS SOME MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS
I HAD A SUBARU NEW FOR 4 MONTHS AND THEN TRADED IT ON MY NEW SUBARU BECAUSE I HATED THE NAVIGATION AND LANE WARNING SYSTEMS SO MUCH NOW I M HAPPY
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO SHOUT YET ENUNCIATE VERY CLEARLY AT THE SAME TIME I MAY NEED TO RE CHECK THE MANUAL ON HOW TO DO IT RIGHT
IMPROVED ACCURACY OF ROUTES IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
BLUETOOTH AND HANDS FREE SYSTEM NEEDS UPDATING DROVE MANY RENTAL CARS THIS YEAR WITH EASIER TO USE CONNECTIVITY SPEAKERS QUALITY IS POOR FOR LISTENING TO MUSIC AND VOICE QUALITY WHEN SPEAKING TO SOMEONE VIA BLUETOOTH
BETTER CLEARER SPEAKERS FOR RADIO AND BLUETOOTH WITH PHONE
THE AUDIO SYSTEM WHILE GOOD FOR A SUBARU IS NOT UP TO INDUSTRY STANDARDS
RADIO LOUDSPEAKERS SOUND BAD I AM AN AUDIO ENGINEER BUT RECEPTION IS GOOD AND THE USE OF EXTERNAL MEMORY STICK IS EXCELLENT AND I REALLY LIKE THE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY TO SEE THE CAR S STATS WHEN I WISH
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM LACK QUALITY AND USEFULNESS
SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL BUTTONS ARE SMALL HARD TO READ AND DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY CHANGE WHILE DRIVING NO WAY TO ELIMINATE UNUSED CHOICES AHA SYSTEM WON T WORK WITH IPHONE BUT WILL WITH ANDROID DOESN T HELP ME WITH MY IPHONE
THE DISPLAY IS TOO SMALL THE NAVIGATION DOESN T WORK UNLESS THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED AND THE TRAFFIC ALERTS ARE INCORRECT THE MAP IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO SEE AND DOESN T SHOW THE STREETS UNTIL YOU ARE RIGHT ON THEM WHICH IS USUALLY TOO LATE TO GET
IT COULD HAVE BETTER USE OF IPHONE FEATURES LIKE MAPS ETC AND BETTER VOICE CONTROLS OF AUDIO CONTENT SMART PHONES ARE MUCH SMARTER THAN THE ON BOARD STUFF IN THE XTERRA I WISH I COULD PORT THEM TO THE TOUCH SCREEN ALSO I WISH DESIGNERS
CONNECTIVITY WITH IPHONE IS INTERMITTENT WITH BLUETOOTH AND SPEAKERS ARE UNACCEPTABLE SPEAKERS SHOULD BE HIGHER QUALITY FOR THE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE
NISSAN CONNECT APP NO LONGER CONNECTS FROM MY CELL PHONE NEED A QUICK CONTACT FEATURE TO CORRECT THIS INSTEAD I GET PROMPTED FOR A PASSWORD I USED A THE INITIAL SETUP
ALLOW PASSENGER TO INPUT COMMANDS TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN OPERATION
THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE I VE HAD WITH A TOUCH SCREEN RADIO SO INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY COOL AFTER USING IT A BIT THOUGH THERE ARE SOME SHORTCOMINGS TO GET AN APPRECIATION OF THIS COMPARE THE TOUCHSCREEN SYSTEM TO AN ANDROID SMART
CRAPPY SYSTEM NO BLUETOOTH
SOME MINIMAL STEERING WHEEL MEDIA CONTROLS OR ACTUAL BUTTONS ON THE HEAD UNIT A MORE UP TO DATE LOOKING NAV UNIT AND AUDIO SOFTWARE
ONLY 6 PRESETS FOR RADIO TOO MANY SCREENS FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
SLOW BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
THE SOUND QUALITY IS POOR AND THE AUX JACK IS IN THE MOST INCONVENIENT LOCATION
BESIDES A CD PLAYER THAT WORKS A MORE RESPONSIVE USB PORT INTERFACE IT SOMETIMES TAKES 30 SECONDS OR LONGER TO READ THE USB DRIVE AND BEGIN PLAYING I VE NEVER SEEN THAT LONG OF A DELAY IN ANY OTHER VEHICLES I VE DRIVEN
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION AND WIRELESS PHONE CALL WAIT TIME AND PROCESS
I WISH IPOD WORK THROUGH USB PORT ALSO THE BLUETOOTH ONLY WORKS FOR PANDORA BUT IT SHOULD WORK FOR ALL MUSIC
BETTER SOUND SYSTEM SHOULD DISPLAY CALLER S NAME FROM CONTACTS INSTEAD OF JUST THE NUMBER ISSUES WITH PANDORA CAN T CONNECT
DOESN T SHOW CORRECT NAME OF SONG ARTIST WHEN PLAYING FROM BLUETOOTH DEVICE
THE TOUCHSCREEN SYSTEM IS NOT GOOD BUT ONCE IT STARTS TO PLAY THE SPEAKERS SOUNDS EXCELLENT I LIKE THE EQUALIZER FEATURES AND THAT ADDS TO THE QUALITY
BLUETOOTH CALLS SOUND COULD BE BETTER ALSO SOMETIMES THE RADIO SOUND CHANGES SOUNDS MORE BASS THEN LESS BASS IN SECOND INTERVALS
FIX THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO MAKE IT EASIER TO USE AND MORE INTELLIGENT
APPS ARE PRETTY USELESS
TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVITY SOMETIMES RESETS PROGRAMMING AS AN EXAMPLE DRIVER ACTIONS TO COMMAND NEARBY CONTROLS CAN BE SENSED AS INTENDED SCREEN TOUCHES
SYSTEM IS FAIRLY EASY TO USE BUT IT S BEST TO BE STOPPED WHEN USING IT CONTROLS REQUIRE HAND EYE COORDINATION THAT IS BEST NOT DISTRACTED FROM THE ROAD WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION VOICE CONTROL SYSTEM IS HANDY IN THESE CASES BUT IT DOES T
I WISH IT WERE EASIER TO GET TO NAVIGATION FEATURES SUCH AS CLOSEST GAS STATIONS AND SPECIFIC RESTAURANTS
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE PHONE SYSTEM NAVIGATION IS EXCELLENT IT WOULD RATE A 10 PHONE ABOUT A 5
STARLINK SYSTEM OFTEN LOCKS UP AFTER MAKING RECEIVING PHONE CALLS ALSO NO ICAR SUPPORT FOR MY IPHONE
AUDIO AND CELL PHONE INTERFACE IS LESS THAT CLEAR AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY DEALER INDICATES THAT THE QUALITY CANNOT BE IMPROVED
LACKS LOW END OF SOUND SPECTRUM AND FAVORITES CAN ONLY SEE A FEW AT A TIME DIFFICULT SLIDE BAR TO GET TO FAVORITES
THE PANDORA APP THAT IT COMES WITH NEEDS WORK IT HAS MAJOR CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WITH MY HTC ONE WHEN IT DOES WORK I LOVE IT BUT THIS IS ONLY ABOUT 60% OF THE TIME I USE PANDORA A LOT SO ITS QUITE IRRITATING ESPECIALLY SINCE ITS ONE OF THE
VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY ROBOTIC
NO ONE CAN HEAR ME WHEN I USE HANDS FREE CALLING AND VOICE RECOGNITION ALWAYS MISUNDERSTANDS ME SO I TALK LOUDER AND IT STILL MISUNDERSTANDS ME I HAVE GIVEN UP USING HANDS FREE CALLING BECAUSE I ALWAYS END UP WITH A SORE THROAT FROM HAVING TO YEL
IT JUST NEEDS A NEW MODEL IT DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH PROCESSING POWER IT STUTTERS DOING EVERYTHING THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS JUST AWFUL AND THE TOUCH SCREEN REQUIRES A LOT OF PRESSURE IT DOES A LOT BUT IT DOES EVERYTHING SLOWLY AND IT THERE ARE
TERRIBLE SOUND QUALITY ON BOTH ENDS OF PHONE CALL PANDORA APP NEVER WORKS
UPON STARTUP THE AUDIO SYSTEM SCREEN DISPLAYS A WARNING MESSAGE ABOUT SAFE DRIVING FOR TOO LONG PREVENTING ME FROM HAVING IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS THE MESSAGE WAS UNDERSTOOD AFTER FIRST READING AND I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO READ IT
VOICE CONTROL ACCURACY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED CALL QUALITY OVER BLUETOOTH NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
A LOT OF TIME CONNECTING A USB DEVICE IS DIFFICULT YOU HAVE TO UNPLUG AND REPLUG THE DEVICE MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THE CAR ACTUALLY RECOGNIZES THE DEVICE
ALMOST EVERYTIME I USE THE TOUCH SCREEN IT DOESN T REGISTER MY TOUCH ON THE FIRST TRY I HAVE TO PRESS 2 3 TIMES TO GET THE BUTTON TO ACTIVATE MAYBE MY HANDS AREN T OILY ENOUGH
VOICE CONTROL COULD BE ACTIVATED BY VOICE RATHER THAN BY PUSHING A BUTTON
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM SLOW TO BOOT UP
MORE OPTIONS ON HOW TO SPLIT THE SCREEN TO SHOW BOTH AUDIO AND NAVIGATION AT THE SAME TIME ALSO ADD USB CONNECTION  CHARGING IN THE SECOND SEAT AREA
THE TOUCH SCREEN ISN T THE MOST USER FRIENDLY
DISPLAY OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT ERGONOMIC IT SHOULD BE LITTLE FURTHER AWAY
SIMPLIFY THE NAVIGATION USAGE
HOW TO PROGRAM THE DESTINATION IS STILL DIFFICULT IF YOU ONL YUSE THE SYSTEM VERY INFREQUENTLY
MY BIGGEST ISSUE IS NAVIGATION THROUGH THE SYSTEM THE THING ITSELF WORKS GREAT BUT THERE ARE A FEW TWEEKS I D LIKE TO MAKE TO THE SETTINGS AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO TRACK THEM DOWN NOW I KNOW HOW TO FIND THEM MOSTLY SUCH AS REDUCING THE VOICE OF
MAKE MIRROR LINK AVAILABLE AND IMPROVE IPHONE INTEGRATION
VOICE RECOGNITION IS DIFFICULT TO USE I NEVER PLAY WITH THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING EXCEPT FOR ANSWERING THE PHONE SHOULD A CALL COME IN
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK WELL AND THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT USER FRIENDLY
NAV SYSTEM WON T ACCEPT INPUT WHILE VEHICLE IS MOVING
USE OF THE PHONE COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE AND EASIER TO USE YOU CAN ACTIVATE THE PHONE ON TOUCH SCREEN OR THE CONTROL ON STEERING WHEEL WHICH CAN BE VOICE ACTIVATED SOME TIMES IT CALLS THE LAST NUMBER DIALED STILL CAN T FIGURE THIS OUT
I FOUND THAT I WAS COMFORTABLE WITH THE ROUTES THAT WERE CHOSEN IN TRAFFIC JAMS IT REROUTED US AND WE WERE VERY SATISFIED
HANDS FREE MOBILE CALLS THROUGH VOICE RECOGNITION
BOTH IN MY GM CORVETTE AND MY PAST LEXUS THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM AS FAR AS OPERATING WHILE DRIVING GOES WAS VASTLY SUPERIOR IN EASE OF OPERATION AND LOGIC OF SYSTEM CONTROL
SUBARU SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER MAKING IT EASIER FOR THE DRIVER TO BE ABLE TO TURN THE INFOTAINMENT CENTER DISPLAY OFF WITHOUT HAVING TO HUNT THROUGH MENUS FOR THAT FUNCTION FOR EXAMPLE THEY COULD INCLUDE A BUTTON FOR IT IN THE MAIN SCREEN WIT
OCCASIONALLY EXPERIENCE CALCULATED NAVIGATION ROUTES WHICH WOULD HAVE DRASTICALLY INCREASED THE TIME REQUIRED TO MAKE THE TRIP AS WELL AS THE DIFFICULTY OF THE DRIVE DIVERSION ON & OFF HIGHWAY NEEDLESSLY AND USE OF UNPAVED ROADS
WISH I COULD JUST TAP A BUTTON FOR A RADIO STATION SIRRUS ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE 3 DIFFERENT SETS OF FAVORITES BUT YOU HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH THEM THIS TAKES YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD
FIX THE MICROPHONE ASPECT OF THE GPS SYSTEM
STARLINK APP IS HARD TO USE TAKES LONG TIME TO CONNECT MANY TIMES INTERNET RADIO WON T CONNECT PLAY FOR NO REASON NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY FOR ME AT LEAST
GET THE MIRROR APP WORKING WITH THE LATEST AND ANY SUBSEQUENT ANDROID VERSIONS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS LIMITED THE PROCESSOR IS TOO SLOW I THINK YOU NEED TO UPGRADE IT WITH EITHER MORE RAM OR A MUCH FASTER PROCESSOR
ABILITY TO USE MORE VOICE COMMANDS THE RESPONSE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IS SLOW
DON T BELIEVE THE CAR OFFERS AS MANY PAIRED FEATURES WITH MY IPHONE AS IT WOULD WITH AN ANDROID
DECREASE THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM TO MUCH OF A DISTRACTION FROM DRIVING JUST TO CHANGE A RADIO STATION
IT NEEDS MULTIPLE CONFIRMATION MAP NAVIGATION COMMANDS ARE PAIN MY OLDER HONDA HAD BETTER NAVIGATION COMMANDS
NO ONE HAS GOOD BLUETOOTH FOR VOICE USE HANDFREE EAR PIECE MUCH CLEARER
WAS UNABLE TO CONNECT MY IPOD WITH CABLE VS USB PORT WILL BE CHECKING ON THIS WHEN TAKING THE CAR IN FOR THE FIRST VEHICLE CHECK I WAS ABLE TO HEAR FINE WHEN TALKING THROUGH THE CAR BLUETOOTH BUT THE PEOPLE COULD NOT HEAR ME WELL ENOUGH TO BE A
THE MAIN THING I LIKE ABOUT THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS ARE THAT THEY WORK RELIABLY HOWEVER SOME OF THE NAVIGATION THROUGH THOSE MENUS IS NOT AS STREAMLINED AS IT COULD BE FINDING AN ADDRESS DOESN T FEEL AS
MAKE IT LESS STRUCTURED WHEN ENTERING ADDRESSES INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MORE LIKE GOOGLE MAPS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE
AUDIO SPEAKERS ARE ONLY AVERAGE SOUND QUALITY THIS CAR DESERVES A PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM
XM RADIO
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SOMETIMES HARD TO FIGURE OUT
NO BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND NO ENTERTAINMENT
TO MAKE THE MENUS ACESSIBLE EVEN WHILE DEVICES ARE TRYING TO CONNECT TO BLUETOOTH
VOICE RECOGNITION AND NAVIGATION EASE OF USE
VOICE COMMAND IS TERRIBLE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK AND I DO NOT RECEIVE A TEXT MESSAGE AS I SHOULD
CANT CHANGE RADIO CHANNELS OR PRESETS WHILE IN REVERSE
A MORE REASONABLE PRICE TO ENSURE CURRENT MAPS
CONFUSING ARRAY OF CHOICES IHEARTRADIO AHA RADIO PANDORA AND XM COULDN T FIGURE OUT THE FIRST TWO PANDORA AND XM WERE EASY TO USE
THE ROUTE GUIDANCE COULD BE EASIER MORE INTUITIVE I HAVE USED LOTS OF GPS DEVICES BUT I STILL HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO PROGRAM A DESTINATION ONCE I READ THE MANUAL I ASSUME I LL BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT IT S NOT INTUITIVE
DON T USE CONNECTIVITY TECHNOLOGY ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE LIKE THE BUILT IN NAV SYSTEM RATHER THAN USING MY SEPERATE GPS THE PRICE OF THE OPTION WITH ALL THE OTHER TECHNOLOGY THAT I WOULD NOT USE DID NOT WARRANT ME PAYING FOR IT I HAVE A DESK TO
AM STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY HAD NAV SYSTEM FAIRLY STEEP LEARNING CURVE FOR NON TECH OLD LADY BUT THINK I WILL LIKE IT WHEN I AM MORE SKILLED AT USING
IMPROVE QUALITY OF PHONE CALL RECEPTION
MORE SENSITIVE VOICE RECOGNITION WE HAVE TO TALK VERY LOUDLY MOST OF THE TIME
CONNECTIVITY WITH OTHER APPLICATIONS ON MY SMARTPHONE E G SPOTIFY
THE APPS I DON T LIKE AHA FOR EXAMPLE IF I COULD ADD MY OWN APPS THEN THAT WOULD BE COOL ALSO IT TAKES TOO LONG TO LINK MY PHONE TO THE SYSTEM THE CONNECTIVE TIME IS LONG NOT THE PHYSICAL CONNECTION STARLINK IS KINDA USELESS IF YOU HAVE PANDOR
THE HANDS FREE CONNECTION FOR THE PHONE IS UNUSABLE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS THE QUALITY OF THE OTHER CALLER IS ADEQUATE BUT THEY CANNOT UNDERSTAND ME PERHAPS THE SYSTEM NEEDS A BETTER MIC
EASIER TO USE MAPS
VOICE RECOGNITION CAN BE FRUSTRATING AT TIMES IT DOES NOT ALWAYS FIND THE NAME OF THE PERSON I WANT TO CALL
TOUCH SCREEN IS DISTRACTING CANNOT CONSISTENTLY CONNECT OTHER DEVICES
MY HUSBAND OFTEN HEARS AN ECHO WHEN I USE THE BLUETOOTH PHONE FEATURE
I DO NOT HAVE A BUILT IN NAVAGATION SYSTEM I USE A GPS
WOULD LIKE TO REMEMBER WHERE I LEFT OF ON A MUSIC PLAYLIST INSTEAD OF HAVING TO REECHOES WHAT I WANT TO HEAR OVERTIME I RESTART THE CAR
I VE BEEN TOLD BLUETOOTH QUALITY FOR PERSON I M CALLING IS POOR THEY HEAR AN ECHO ALTHOUGH I HEAR THEM FINE
GET THE IPHONE TO FULLY INTERFACE WITH BLUETOOTH IMPROVE RELIABILITY OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITH REGARDS TO GETTING AROUND AND PREDICTING TRAFFIC AND ARRIVAL TIMES ACCURATELY
THE SOUND OF THE SPEAKERS ISNT VERY GOOD QUALITY THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS KIND OF CONFUSING TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE EASIER LIKE THE PORTABLE GARMINS
PLEASE BRING BACK THE DIALS I DISLIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN WHEN ATTEMPTING TO SWITCH CHANNELS I FIND THAT I HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR TOO LONG A PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE THE CHANNELS DON T SWITCH EASILY VIA THE TOUCH SYSTEM I HAVE TO KEEP
THE LENGTH OF TIME TO CONNECT TO CELL PHONE CAN BE IMPROVED
VOICE COMMANDS ARE USELESS FOR ME SINCE I HAVE A DEEP LOW VOICE THE ANDROID APP PROVIDED BY SUBARU FOR CONNECTING TO THE CAR IS AN ATROCITY
IT IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND DRIVE AT THE SAME TIME
IPOD NAVIGATION IS SOMEWHAT CLUNKY IF POSSIBLE A TOUCH SCREEN WITH DRAG TO SCROLL FEATURE WOULD MAKE NAVIGATING MUSIC AND ARTISTS EASIER AS IT STANDS THE SCREEN CAN ONLY SUPPORT A FEW ARTISTS AT ONE TIME AND IT TAKES TOO MUCH TIME AND CONCENTR
BETTER SOUND QUALITY DURING BLUETOOTH CALLS USING THE SPEAKERS HIGHER QUALITY WOULD ENCOURAGE DRIVERS TO USE THIS INSTEAD OF USING THE PHONE TRADITIONALLY
I WISH I HAD A CD PLAYER
STARLINK APP NEEDS TO BE FUNCTIONAL AND ONCE IT IS REWRITTEN SO THAT IT ACTUALLY CONNECTS IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO BE ABLE TO ADD MORE MUSIC WEATHER AND TRAFFIC APPS OR BOOKMARKS THAT I HAVE ON MY PHONE ALSO THE STANDARD SPEAKERS ACTUALLY HURT M
I WOULD LIKE THE SYSTEM TO READ AND COMPOSE TEXT MESSAGES I WOULD ALSO LIKE IT TO HAVE A BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
DOES NOT HAVE A RANDOM SELECTION FOR MP3 PLAYER
BLUETOOTH MICROPHONE NEED TO BE IMPROVED PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END OF THE CALL CANNOT UNDERSTAND ME
I HAVEN T USED ALL FEATURES I LIKE THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS
LOVE THAT THE PHONE AUTOMATICALLY CONNECTS THROUGH BLUETOOTH WHEN I GET IN THE CAR
THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND WHEN MAKING CALLS USING A BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS POOR PEOPLE RECEIVING CALLS FROM MY VEHICLE SAY IT IS HARD TO HEAR ME
SATELLITE RADIO SHOULD BE STANDARD AND THE SPEAKERS SHOULD BE UPGRADED
CHANNEL SELECTION VIA THE TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY FRUSTRATING
SOUND QUALITY IN GENERAL IS OKAY BUT YOU SEEM TO NEED VOLUME TO BE AT A HIGHER THAN AVERAGE LEVEL IT S LIKE THE SPEAKERS ARE MUFFLED SCREEN QUALITY TOUCH LIKE AN IPHONE IS GREAT APP FEATURES REQUIRES ACCOUNTS AND WHO NEEDS ANOTHER ACCOUNT
I MAY NOT HAVE USED THE SYSTEMS ENOUGH TO ADEQUATELY JUDGE I THINK THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAYS ARE DISTRACTING AND DANGEROUS SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE IN VEHICLES
FIX THE GLITCHES WITH BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
THE AUDIO CONTROLS BOTH ON THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE TOUCH SCREEN NEED TO BE ADDRESSED
THE VOICE RECOGNITIONS SYSTEM DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MY VOICE MOST OF THE TIME IT IS FRUSTRATING TO USE SO I RATHER NOT USE IT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MONITOR IS BELOW DRIVING EYE LEVEL SO I HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO SEE READ THE NAV
THE SUBARU STARLINK APP DOES NOT WORK WELL I HAVE LOADED IT MULTIPLE TIMES AND IT ONLY WORKS ON OCCASION DEPENDING ON HOW RURAL THE AREA I AM TRAVELING
NOT VERY LOUD THE DEALER BOASTED ON THE SOUND SYSTEM BUT IN MY OPINION IT IS JUST A SMALL NOTCH ABOVE AVERAGE THE PANDORA APP WILL NOT SYNC WITH MY IPHONE UNLESS I HAVE THE SUBARU STARLINK APP WHICH IS A USELESS APP EVEN WITH STARLINK P
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOICE TEXT AND VOICE READ TEXT TO ME THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE THE ON OFF VOLUME BUTTON IS SMALL FOR THE RADIO CLIMATE CONTROL WOULD BE NICE THE SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER NOT GREAT SPEAKERS
VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD BE MORE INTUITIVE LIKE A SMARTPHONE SECONDLY THE AUDIO QUALITY IS POOR
WHEN WE ARE ALL IN THE CAR IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING SYNCING THE CAR TO THE DESIRED DEVICE BUT NOT A BIG DEAL
THE SPEAKER SYSTEM WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST I TWEAKED IT 100 DIFFERENT WAYS AND GOT 100 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF BAD I GAVE UP AND HAD AN AFTERMARKET SYSTEM INSTALLED NOW IT IS GREAT AND THE COST OF THE AFTERMARK SYSTEM ALPINE SPEAKERS PIONEER
VOICE CONTROL SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE AND UNDERSTAND FIND DIFFICULTY IN USING VOICE CONTROL TO ADJUST MEDIA SELECTION AND HAVE NOT TRIED IT FOR HEATING COOLING
CANNOT USE PANDORA THROUGH IPHONE THROUGH USB OR BLUETOOTH NO SIRIUS CONNECTIVITY
THE APPS SUCH AS AHA AND PANDORA ARE HARD TO USE I HAVE TO USE BLUETOOTH FOR ANY AUDIO FROM PHONE TO SUBARU I WOULD LIKE TO PLUG IN MY PHONE AND PLAY
AUDIO SOUND LEVEL DIAL IS SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO GRIP TO TURN HAVING A PROBLEM WITH IPOD FREEZING UP
I HATE THE FLAT TOUCH SCREEN SUN REFLECTS OFF OF IT AND IT BLINDS ME AND MAKES IT VERY HARD TO SEE
STILL NEED TO RESOLVE CERTAIN CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WITH IPOD AND IPHONE FOR MUSIC
NOTICED THAT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS US TAKE THE WRONG WAY TO GET TO OUR HOUSE FROM THE SOUTH IT HAS US GET OFF THE INTERSTATE AND TAKE SURFACE STREETS WHEN THE FREEWAY IS BEST
USB CONNECTIVITY
PEOPLE CANNOT HEAR ME THROUGH BLUETOOTH
SCREEN DOES NOT TURN OFF FAST ENOUGH VOICE COMMANDS SLOW
I WOULD LIKE MORE WAYS TO CUSTOMIZE THE INDIVIDUAL SCREENS WITH MY OWN PICTURES THE ABILITY TO TURN OFF THE INITIAL WARNING SCREEN AND AN EASY WAY TO UPDATE THE ON BOARD GRACENOTE DATABASE I WOULD LIKE THE SUBARU STARLINK APP TO BE MORE THAN A J
SOUND QUALITY FOR PHONE CALLS ESPECIALLY FOR THE RECEIVING END THE PEOPLE I AM CALLING HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING ME
BACK UP SCREEN TOO SMALL
ADD BETTER SUPPORT FOR SMART PHONE INTEGRATION ESPECIALLY APPLE S CARPLAY
THE SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE BUT SOME HIDDEN SETTINGS MAKE IT TOLERABLE STILL WAY WORSE THAN IT SHOULD BE
BETTER VOLUM CONTROL AND SOUND LIKE BOSE
NAV SCREEN SHOULD HAVE ICONS FOR DESTINATIONS FREQUENTLY USED SUCH AS HOME AND WORK THAT WOULD SAVE TIME BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE FEWER STEPS TO INPUT YOUR FREQUENT DESTINATIONS ALSO NAV SYSTEM SOMETIMES DIRECTS DRIVER TO GET OFF HIGHWAY FOR SH
SOUND QUALITY IS BELOW AVERAGE THIS DAY AND AGE
EVEN THOUGH THE SPEAKERS ARE THE STANDARD ONES THEY DO NOT GET LOUD AT ALL JUST TO BE ABLE TO HEAR IT CLEARLY I HAVE TO HAVE IT OVER 30 OUT OF 440 THE BASE IS VERY POOR AS WELL AND WITH NO NEED FOR NAVIGATION $2000 IS WAY TO MUCH FOR SPEAKER
NAVIGATION IT S USELESS DUE TO HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO SEARCH FOR A PARTICULAR PLACE AUDIO WHEN MY BLUETOOTH DEVICE IS PLAYING MUSIC IT TAKES THE SYSTEM 10 SECONDS TO DISPLAY INFORMATION ABOUT A SONG WHEN CHANGING FROM ANOTHER TRACK HANDS F
SEE EARLIER COMMENT ON FACTORY SPEAKERS ALSO SYSTEM NEEDS A MORE USER FRIENDLY APP SYSTEM THAT WORKS MORE CONSISTENTLY
WISH THERE WAS SOMEONE TO ALLOW USE OF THE SEARCH FOR ADDRESS OF THE NAV WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING MY PASSENGERS CAN T ENTER ADDRESSES BECAUSE IT IS NOT ALLOWED
BETTER SOUND QUALITY AND SPEAKER VOLUME
BLUETOOTH WITH PHONE CALLS LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED FOR SOUND QUALITY ON THE OTHER END I HEAR PEOPLE JUST FIE THEY DON T HEAR ME SOUND SYSTEM LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED I GUESS THAT IS WHY THEY OFFER A SOUND SYSTEM UPGRADE
THERE IS SO MUCH TO LIST IT DOESN T FEEL NATURAL YOU CAN OBVIOUSLY TELL THAT THIS WAS AN AFTERTHOUGHT IT S SIMPLY AN AFTERMARKET SCREEN WITH SUBARU WRITTEN ON TOP ONE OF THE WORST I VE SEEN I DON T EVEN BOTHER USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION FM
REAR FACING CAMARA SHOULD BE SHOWN ON NAVIGATION SCREEN
THE STARLINK SYSTEM IS BUGGY SOMETIMES IT WORKS GREAT AND OTHER TIMES IT DOES NOT UNLESS YOU DO THINGS IN A VERY SPECIFIC ORDER IT ALWAYS GOES BACK TO SONG 1 X ON AN IPOD IT COULD DEFINITELY BE A LITTLE SMOOTHER IN TERMS OF CONNECTIVITY
THE BIGGEST ISSUE I VE HAD IS THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IS CLUNKY IN ITS MENU SETUPS AND SLOW IN ITS PROCESSING WHICH COMBINES WITH THE FREQUENT RECOGNITION MISTAKES TO MAKE ME AVOID USING IT ENTIRELY
PROBABLY MY FAULT FOR NOT TAKING THE TIME TO BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH IT BUT I M NOT REALLY THRILLED WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
I HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE AHA AND THE STARLINK CONNECTION FROM PHONE TO CAR THAT COULD ASPECT COULD BE A BIT MORE USER FRIENDLY
WHEN I CALL SOMEONE USING THE AUDIO SYSTEM THAT PERSON CAN HARDLY HEAR ME TALKING BECAUSE OF ROAD NOISE
BETTER RESPONSE TO VOICE COMMANDS FOR PHONE ALSO THE SOUND GOES UP REALLY LOUD WHEN I STEP ON THE GAS
I GET COMPLAINTS TALKING TO PEOPLE USING THE HANDS FREE FEATURE SO I STOPPED USING IT THEY SAID I SOUND LIKE I M IN A SPACESHIP THE PANDORA APP WORKS PRETTY GOOD THE IPOD CONNECTIVITY COULD BE BETTER IT S DIFFICULT TO START PLAYING MUSIC W
WHEN USING THE USB PORT FOR AN IPOD THE SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO HAVE A QUICK WAY TO SCROLL USING THE TOUCH SCREEN TO SCROLL CAN BE SLOW AND DANGEROUS IF YOU ARE THE DRIVER
A BETTER SYNC WITH EXTERNAL MP3 IPHONE IN MY CASE THAT DISPLAY MORE OF MY PHONE S SCREEN I E ALBUM COVERS IT IS MY FIRST BLUETOOTH EXPERIENCE SO I M NOT SURE IF THERE S ALWAY A LAG
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS ABSOLUTELY USELESS I HAVE GIVEN UP USING IT AND RELY UPON THE MANUAL CONTROLS TO MAKE PHONE CALLS
THE VOICE COMMAND IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO USE  NOT VERY ACCURATE AND I HAVE YET TO BE ABLE TO SEND  RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES HANDS FREE DESPITE READING THE MANUAL THAT SAYS THIS IS AN OPTION
USING BLUETOOTH FOR ENGAGING THE PHONE
THE NAV SYSTEM COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY I LIKE TO ZOOM AND PAN AND THIS IS DIFFICULT IN THE TOYOTA
VOICE CONTROL COULD USE IN BUILT VOICE COMMANDS SIRI ETC RATHER THAN SUBARU S SYSTEM
MAKE IT EASIER TO SCROLL THROUGH FOLDERS ON A CONNECTED IPOD IT S A PAIN TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING SPECIFIC WHEN YOU HAVE HUNDREDS OF ENTRIES IN A LIST
THE VOICE CONTROL IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND RARELY UNDERSTANDS THE COMMANDS
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FINE BUT NOTHING SPECIAL I LIKE THE BLUETOOTH AND DISPLAY FOR IT
THE BASE RADIO IS ALMOST USELESS I KEEP THE MULTIFUNCTION DISPLAY ON THE RADIO PAGE MOST OF THE TIME SO I KNOW WHAT S HAPPENING WITH MY RADIO I OPTED NOT TO GET THE UPGRADED PACKAGE WITH NAVIGATION BECAUSE THE NAVIGATION LOOKED AND FELT CHEAP
IPHONE AUDIO AUTOMATICALLY STARTS AT THE END OF PHONE CALL OR WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED WHETHER I WAS LISTENING TO IT BEFORE OR NOT UNLESS THE RADIO IS TURNED OFF
MAKE A PATCH SO TEXT MESSAGES CAN BE RETURNED VIA HANDS FREE HAS NEVER WORKED CORRECTLY AND WAS ONE REASON FOR OUR PURCHASE
VOICE RECOGNITION AND SOUND QUALITY
CALL RECIPIANTS COMPLAIN OF STRANGE NOISES FOR FIRST MINUTE OF CALL THEN IT GOES AWAY ONLY HAPPENS WHEN PHONE IS CONNECTED TO THE CAR IN HANDS FREE MODE
THE LAYOUT OF THE BUTTONS ON THE NAV AUDIO SCREEN FORCES ME TO SCROLL TO SWITCH BETWEEN BLUETOOTH AUDIO AND THE OTHER AUDIO FUNCTIONS LIKE XM IT REALLY SHOULD ALLOW THE USER TO ARRANGE THEM ALSO IF THE SCREEN WAS BIGGER WITH BIGGER BUTTONS THEY
THE VOICE ACTIVATED SYSTEM IS NOT VERY USEFUL WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN CAR TALKING IT ALMOST HAS BE VERY QUIET
TOUCH SCREEN WITHOUT HAVING TO UPGRADE TO NAVIGATION
NAVIGATION REQUIRES THAT YOU RE COMPLETELY STOPPED IN ORDER TO ENTER AN ADDRESS INCONVENIENT ESPECIALLY WHEN LOST
EASIER VOICE FOR CELL PHONE RECOGNIZTION
TOUCHSCREEN AUDIO CONTROLS ARE TOO DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN DRIVING WOULD PREFER TRADITIONAL KNOBS AND BUTTONS
I REALLY ONLY USE THE RADIO & MY HANDS FREE PHONE & BOTH ARE GREAT
THE OPTIONAL HARMON KARDON AUDIO SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING
THE SPEAKERS ARE GREAT I CAN HAER PHONE CALLS WELL BUT THE MIC FOR MY VOICE ISN T THAT GREAT ALONG WITH THE ROAD NOISE MAKE IT HARD FOR THE PERSON I AM TALKING TO TO HEAR ME
POOR AUDIO SYSTEM DESIGN THE COMMUNICATION NEEDS TO BE PROGRAMMED OR RECORDED FIRST IN ORDER TO USE VOICE COMMANDS OTHER VEHICLES HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION INSTALLED ALREADY NOT HAVING TO PRERECORD ANYTHING I HUGE WAIST OF MY TIME TO DO THIS AUDI
DON T HAVE NAVIGATION AUDIO IS CLEAR
UNIT NEEDS TO BE LARGER ON THE AUDIO THE CHANNEL BUTTONS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN ARE WONKY AND IT S HARD TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT CHANNEL NOT A PRESET WHILE DRIVING
LACKS ADEQUATE BASS RESPONSE BLUETOOTH PHONE MIGHT UTILIZE ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS TO IMPROVE AUDIO QUALITY
THE SYSTEM IS SIMPLE TO USE BUT THE THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS ISN T THAT GREAT AND THERE AREN T VERY MANY SPEAKERS I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE PAID A LITTLE MORE FOR THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM IT GETS THE JOB DONE BUT IT S NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT
THE CAR WON T LET YOU ENTER AN ADDRESS NOT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION I UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY ASPECT OF THIS FEATURE BUT MOST OF THE TIME IT IS A PASSENGER ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE ADDRESS THE DRIVER SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIB
DON T USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS I USE MY IPHONE S
MAKE IT MORE INTUITIVE SOMETIMES TAKES A BIT OF NAVIGATION TO FIND WHAT YOU RE LOOKING FOR IM NOT A TUTORIAL TYPE OF PERSON LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I AM GOING WITHOUT READING MANUALS
QUICKER VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN WE ARE USING THE SYSTEM
NAVIGATION DIRECTED ME TO LONGER ROUTE
MAKING HANDS FREE OPERATIONS MORE USER FRIENDLY
I WISH THE CONTROLS WERE EASIER BETTER FROM THE STEERING WHEEL IT CAN BE DISTRACTING TO TRY TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN
MY CELLPHONE DISCONNECTS AND RECONNECTS EVERY 5 SECONDS TO THE SYSTEM I AM UNSURE IF THIS IS MY CELL PHONE SERVICE OR THE VEHICLE ITSELF
LOCATION OF USB PORTS I POD JACK
I HAVE A BOSE AUDIO SYSTEM NOT REALLY IMPRESSED WITH IT IT DOESN T SOUND GREAT MAY BE DUE TO EXTERNAL NOISE COMING INTO THE VEHICLE OR THE LOCATION OF THE SPEAKERS
THE PHONE SYSTEM IS NEVER CONSISTANT AS FAR AS SHOWING MY PHONEBOOK ON THE DISPLAY IS ONLY COMES UP ABOUT 10% OF THE TIME
GET APPLE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES FOR COMPATIBILITY WORKED OUT AND IT WOULD BE OUTSTANDING
PROVIDE PASSENGER OVERRIDE OPTIONS FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM SATELLITE RADIO PROGRAMMING AND SELECT FEATURES TOO CUMBERSOME WITH TOO MANY STEPS
BLUETOOTH SHOULD HAVE BEEN STANDARD
THE NISSAN APP IS HORRIBLE I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT TO PANDORA OR IHEART I HAVE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS SEVERAL TIME AND HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT WORK
ALLOW USE WHILE DRIVING WITH A PASSENGER AND ALLOW CONTROL OF THE DVD MENU FROM THE FRONT SEAT
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR IPOD AUDIO JUST DOESN T WORK PROPERLY AS IT TAKES FOREVER TO INITIALIZE MAKING IT USELESS MOST OF THE TIME
PREVIOUSLY I HAD A NISSAN MURANO WITH A BOSE SOUND SYSTEM AND THE QUALITY OF THAT SOUND SYSTEM BASS VOLUME ETC WAS BETTER QUALITY THAN THE NISSAN MURANO
I SOMETIMES HAVE TO PLUG IN MY IPHONE 2 OR 3 TIMES BEFORE IT THE CAR IS ABLE TO READ THE MUSIC FILES
CONNECT APPS
THE SPEAKERS SOUND FAR AND LOW SOMETIMES WHEN I USE THE IPOD IT SOUNDS LIKE THE DRIVER SPEAKER GOES OUT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE EASIER TO USE WE HAVE TO SEARCH FEATURES A LOT TO FIND THE CORRECT COMMANDS PERHAPS AS WE USE IT MORE IT WILL BECOME EASIER TO USE THIS CAR IS STILL RELATIVELY NEW FOR US
THE CELL PHONE BLUETOOTH AUDIO IS VERY GOOD TO OUTSTANDING FOR EASE OF USE AND FIDELITY THE NAV IS EASY TO USE AND DISPLAY IS EXCELLENT HOWEVER MAPS ARE NOT 100% UP TO DATE AND NOT JUST MISSING NEWLY BUILT RAODS BUT LONG ESTABLISHED ADDRESSES
BLUETOOTH APPS NO CORD
WAS TOLD AND SHOWN ON NISSANS WEBSITE AND PROMISED MULTIPLE IN DASH APPS GOT ONE AND NO TIME FRAME FOR NEW ONES THIS IS A PLATINUM ADDITION AND SOOO DISAPPOINTING IN THE ON BOARD SYSTEM NAVIGATION IS THE SLOWEST I HAVE EVER SEEN AND USED
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH MY NISSAN IS THE ENTERTAINMENT CD PLAYERS ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD REST I HAD A NISSAN AND THE CD PLAYERS HAD THE DISC INSERTED INTO THE PLAYERS ITSELF AND NOT IN THE FRONT RADIO LIKE THE MY KIDS ARE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION ON POIS IS TERRIBLE I SHOULD HAVE LISTED THIS IN THE OTHER SECTION BUT ONLY JUST REMEMBERED I CAN T GET IT TO RECOGNIZE ANYTHING I AM SAYING IT ALWAYS COMES UP WITH SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND ITS USUALLY SEVERAL
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
THE REMOTE TO THE REAR TV IS VERY HARD TO NAVIGATE THE MENUS
WHEN USING THE SATELLITE RADIO SOME OF THE TEXT IS TRUNCATED
AGAIN WISH IT HAD NAVIGATION AND TOUCH SCREEN
HEARING WHILE TALKING ON THE PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH COULD BE A LITTLE CLEARER ALSO INTEGRATED PANDORA WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT UPGRADE
IT HAS THE BOSE SYSTEM AND THE SUB WOOFER IN THE CARGO HOLD COULD HAVE HAD A STRONGER RESPONSE WHEN PLAYING A VIDEO THIS IS NOW AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLUE RAY AND NOT DVD WHEN PLAYING A MOVIE THE SOUND SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SURROUND SOUND
USING BUT MODIFYING EXISTING PREVIOUS ADDRESSES WITH THE GPS WITH THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO A WAY TO NAVIGATE MUSIC FOLDERS AS WITH THE USB MUSIC
HAVE HAD VEHICLE FOR 3 MONTHS STILL TRYING TO LEARN AUDIO SYSTEM
THE COMPASS IS TERRIBLE I LITERALLY CANNOT TELL WHAT DIRECTION I AM GOING THERE ARE TOO MANY LAYERS TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OFTEN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE CAR CANNOT FIND THE ADDRESS THEN I PUT THE SAME ADDRESS IN GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE
I NOTICE WHEN CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH TO SITES SUCH AS YOUTUBE THE VOLUME CONTROL NEEDS TO BE MOVED UP HIGHER TO GET A BETTER MUSIC EXPERIENCE
NAV SCREEN IS LARGE AND EASY TO READ AND USE
BETTER SOUND ON HANDS FREE PHONE HAD TO GO BACK TO USING MY EARPIECE TO BE HEARD CLEARLY
THE NAVIGATION IS OUT OF DATE FOR A VEHICLE IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE MY STREET AND HOW TO GET THERE AND MY NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN HERE FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS
OPERATION OF NAV SYSTEM
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SEND TEXT MESSAGES THROUGH THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM OF THE CAR IT GIVES OPTIONS BUT THE MESSAGE FAILS TO GO THROUGH LIKELY USER ERROR AND HAVE NOT YET INVESTIGATED WITH DEALERSHIP
DON T HAVE OR WANT A CELL PHONE CONNECTED TO MY CAR DON T HAVE OR WANT A NAVIGATION SYSTEM TOUCH SCREEN IT A MAJOR DRIVING DISTRACTION WHEN SELECTING A NEW STATION OR SONG
AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE ROUTES
A LARGER DISPLAY SCREEN WOULD BE GREAT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND NO HELP WAS OFFERED
HAVE MENTIONED TIME DETERMINATION OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM PREVIOUSLY BUT OTHER ISSUE WOULD BE FOR TRAFFIC IT DOES STATE THERE ARE DELAYS BUT COULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION SOONER AND HAS ONLY ONCE ASKED IF I WANTED AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE ALTHOUGH WH
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM REQUIRES SOME GETTING USE TO IT S NOT AS INTUITIVE AS SOME PORTABLE GARMIN TYPE OF GPS PRODUCTS IT S MORE SOPHISTICATED AND REQUIRES THE USER TO DO SOME HOMEWORK
TRAFFIC FEATURES ARE NOT INTUITIVE AND SLOW VOICE RECOGNITION IS USELESS INABILITY TO ADD DESTINATIONS WHILE DRIVING THROUGH VOICE OR PASSENGER IS FRUSTRATING
GOOD SOUND QUALITY POOR USABILITY AND FUNCTION VERY VERY VERY VERY POOR VOICE RECOGNITION
MY MAGELLAN UNIT IS FAR SUPERIOR TO BUILT IN NAVIGATION
VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE FACT THAT THE ENTUNE SYSTEM WILL NOT WORK CONNECT WITH APPLE IPHONE WHEN A DEVICE SUCH AS AN MP3 PLAYER IPOD IS PLUGGED INTO USB PORT THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ANDROID OPERATING SYSTEM DEVICES WHEN USING MY IPHONE I H
WHEN USING IPHONE SOUND IS A BIT DISTORTED AND SEEMS ECHO EY
WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO PROGRAM THE NAVIGATION WHILE VEHICLE IN MOTION
EASE OF VOICE RECOGNITION
THE ENTUNE APP FOR MY PHONE DOESN T SEEM TO EXIST I CAN T USE ANY OF THE INTERNET FEATURES BUMMER THAT I HAVE TO GET A NEW PHONE TO USE THESE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SOMETIMES BEHIND WHEN IN THE CITY IT IS SOMETIMES BEHIND OR GETS CONFUSED
DEFINITELY THE NAV SYSTEM THE VOICE CONTROL NEVER WORK FOR ME BUT I NEVER HAD A LOT OF LUCK WITH ANY VOICE CONTROL EVEN SIRI
THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE RADIO IS NOT VERY GOOD I VE NOTICED A BUZZING SOUND FROM A REAR SPEAKER I M HOPING IT S NOT THE SPEAKER BUT JUST THE MOUNTING HAS COME LOOSE I DON T TURN MY VOLUME UP LOUD ENOUGH TO DAMAGE A SPEAKER
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A 6 CD PLAYER AS MY PREVIOUS PRIUS HAD ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A VOICE ACTIVATED GPS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CANNOT BE SET FOR A NEW LOCATION WHILE THE CARE IS IN MOTION EVEN IF IT IS A PASSENGER TRYING TO OPERATE IT
POOR VISIBILITY IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT
THE MAP IS HARD TO VIEW AND READ EVEN PASSENGERS CANNOT READ THE TYPE ON THE SCREEN FOR STREET NAMES
RECENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN OCCASIONAL DISRUPTIONS AS I WAS LISTENING TO A RADIO STATION DUE TO SOME KIND OF ALERT THAT DOESN T MAKE ANY SENSE IT HAS BEEN IRRITATING I FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO GO BACK TO WHAT I WAS LISTENING TO
BETTER NAVIGATION SYSTEM GARMIN FOR EXAMPLE
EASE OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAV SYSTEM IS USELESS SCREEN IS DIFFICULT OR NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT AS FOR OTHER ISSUES WITH THE SYSTEM I HAVE ALREADY STATED THEM IN PREVIOUS QUESTIONS OTHER THAN THE POOR NAV SYSTEM AND VOICE RECOGNITION I LOVE THIS
AUDIO DISPLAY DOES NOT LET YOU SWITCH SOURCES ON THE SAME DISPLAY MUST GO TO ONE OR TWO MORE BEFORE BEING ABLE TO SELECT CAR INFO ON ENGINE IS NOT IN SYNC WITH BUILT IN DASH DISPLAY ONE SAY THE GAS ENGINE IS ON THE OTHER SAY IT IS NOT TOO LIT
IT COULD BE MADE LESS COMPLICATED I HAVE NOT MANAGED TO USE THE ENTUNE SERVICE THE BLUETOOTH PHONE IS OK THOUGH INCONSISTENT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY MUCH INFERIOR TO THE ONE ON MY PHONE AND ALTHOUGH ITS VISIBILITY IS IN THEORY BETTER
NAVIGATION IS A LITTLE OUTDATED COMPARED TO USING YOUR PHONE AUDIO COULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED BUT I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS I NEVER USE THE BUILT IN APPS ENTUNE AND I THINK THEY RE A TOTAL WASTE OF YOUR TIME
THE RADIO DOES NOT ALWAYS PAUSE WHEN A PHONE CALL COMES IN
IF YOU DONT HAVE A SMART PHONE MOST FEATURES ARE NOT AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE AN IPAD AND INTERNET ACCESS CAR USES ONLY BLUETOOTH AND IGNORES BUILT IN FEATGURES OF AN IPAD WITH DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNITION OF CELL PHONE OFTEN OTHER FEATURES BE
VOICE RECOGNITION AND NO TOUCH SCREEN RADIO CONTROLS DIALS PLEASE
IT S REALLY HARD TO TELL THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MAP OPTIONS AND OFTEN THE ONE CITED AS QUICKEST IS NOT THE FASTEST ROUTE
ABILITY FOR PASSENGER TO OVERRIDE AND ENTER ADDRESS OF DESTINATION VERSES HAVING TO STOP CAR EASE OF USE NOT AS USER FRIENDLY AS STANDARD GPS SYSTEMS
IT WORKS FINE JUST DONT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN POSITIONING IT IS AHRD TO SEE ON A SUNNY DAY AND COULD BE TILTED TOWARD THE DRIVER FOR EASIER VIEWING
STREET NAMES ON THE MAP ARE TOO SMALL FOR THIS OLDER DRIVER TO READ EVEN WITH MY READING GLASSES ON THIS IS A NEW PROBLEMS THAT WAS NOT EVIDENT ON MY OR PRIUS S
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM DOES NOT PICK UP VOICE COMMANDS AND ALWAYS GETS THEM WRONG TOO FRUSTRATING TO USE I ALSO DON T LIKE HAVING TO PLUG MY PHONE INTO USB IN ORDER TO USE THE INTERNET FEATURES
SOUND QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED NAVIGATION COULD BE EASIER TO USE
SPEAKER SOUND QUALITY
MORE PHYSICAL CONTROLS OR TOUCHSCREEN THAT WORKS AS WELL AS PHONE S DO
THE TOUCH BUTTONS ON CHANGING THE RADIO STATIONS COULD BE LARGER
MORE USER FRIENDLY NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND FIX THE FREEZING PROBLEM
MORE EFFICIENT VOICE RECOGNITION
USE OF USB TO CONNECT IPAD AND NOT TORECHARGE BATTERY
IF IT WORKED IT MIGHT BE OK ALSO YOU NEED TO UPDATE THE NAVIGATION GPS THE DIRECTIONS ARE 20 YEARS OUT OF DATE FOR ASHEVILLE AND CHARLOTTE NC I HAVE TO USE GOOGLE MAPS ON MY IPHONE FIX THE FREEZING UP PROBLEM ON THE TOUCH SCREEN
HAVEN T REALLY HAD A CHANCE TO EXPLORE VOICE RECOGNITION SO WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT MORE OF THAT INFO
MY SCREEN FREEZES WHEN TEMPERATURE EXCEEDS 80 DEGREES THIS IS A SERIOUS INCONVENIENCE THE APPS SCREEN OFTEN DOES NOT FUNCTION EVEN WHEN I HAVE NOT ALTERED THE ENTUNE ON MY PHONE MY OLD BUICK ENCORE WAS NOT DEPENDENT ON AN APP LINE ENTUNE OR
NAVIGATION SYSTEM HARD TO UNDERSTAND
CAN T UNDERSTAND THE MANUAL SO DON T USE MOST OF WHAT IS AVAILSBLE HAVE EMAILED QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTED THAT THEY HAVE A MANUAL FOR DUMMIES OR OFFER A CLASS LIKE APPLE DOES FOR THEIR PRODUCTS
A CONCISE QUICK START GUIDE FOR THE BLUETOOTH AND THE NAVIGATION
NEEDS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH IPOD CLASSIC WHICH HAS THE LARGEST STORAGE CAPACITY OF ANY IPOD AND THE SCREEN NEEDS TO STOP LOCKING UP WHEN AN IPOD CLASSIC IS ATTACHED AND TOYOTA SHOULD LIST FOR HE PUBILC WHICH IPODS NOT PHONES ARE COMPATIBLE
UNFORTUNATELY MY TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM HAS FAILED ME TWICE NOW THEREFORE IF IT CONSISTENTLY WORKED I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH THE AUDIO AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AS WELL AS WITH THE OVERALL FUNCTION OF MY CAR
THE APPS ARE CLUNKY AND LACKING IN FUNCTIONALITY THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS EASY TO USE LIMIT THE USE OF CERTAIN FEATURES WHEN DRIVING AND SOMETIMES AT ODD PLACES AND YOU CAN NOT PICK CHOOSE WHICH APPS YOU WANT AND DON T WANT LIKEWISE THERE IS NO
THE NEW TECHNOLOGY MAKES IT LESS USEFUL AND MORE DISTRACTING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS WAY TOO CONFUSING IT SHOULD BE MADE SIMPLER TOO MANY CHOICES AND I CAN NEVER FIGURE OUT HOW TO END THE NAVAGAGATING SYSTEM
AUDIO SYSTEM DOESN T WORK WELL IN VERBALLY INSTRUCTING NAVIGATION SYSTEM
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE OPERATED BY THE PASSENGER WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING
BETTER QUALITY SPEAKERS SOUND CONSISTENTLY WORKING TOUCH SCREEN
MORE VOICE RESPONSE TO QUERIES FROM NAVIGATION SUCH AS TRAFFIC NEAR ME IMPROVED SPEECH RECOGNITION STARTUP SPEED
TOUCH SCREEN SOMETIMES DOESN T WORK WELL
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION DOESN T ALWAYS WORK
ALREADY BEEN TO THE DEALER ON THIS ONE WITH NO HELP FROM THEM THEY SAID THEY RE SET THE SYSTEM BUT IT DID NOT HELP TICKS CLICKS ON BOTH AM AND FM I DON T THINK IT IS GROUNDED PROPERLY TOUCH SCREEN FREEZES AND DOESN T WORK AT ALL UNTIL I ST
NAVIGATING THE SOUND CHANNELS AND GPS NAV FEATURES IS TOO COMPLEX
I M STILL LEARNING VOICE RECOGNITION TRAINING HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BUT THERE IS STILL TOO MUCH CONFUSION AND MIS READINGS
SIRI DOESN T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING
TOUCH SCREEN NOT FREEZING UP
MORE INSTRUCTION FOR VOICE RECOGNITION
I VE SEEN BETTER DISPLAYS I E GARMIN THE SMALL SCREEN MAKES IT HARD TO READ SOME STREET NAMES ALSO WHEN USING THE MENU OFTEN THE SCREEN ACCEPTS THE TOUCH AS A MAP REPOSITION THE SIDE BUTTONS CAN BE OVER SENSITIVE PERHAPS AN ADJUSTMENT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT PROPERLY FUNCTION SO I AM UNABLE TO USE IT AND CAN NOT RELY ON IT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ENTER SEARCH LOCATION INFORMATION AND THE VOICE CONTROL IS VERY INACCURATE IT IS ALSO A BIT CUMBERSOME TO USE THE APPS I DISLIK
IT S VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN THE TOUCHSCREEN IS UNRESPONSIVE IT MAKES ALL OF THE FEATURES DIFFICULT TO USE
YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL HOW LOUD YOU SPEAK IN THE HANDS FREE PHONE OR THE OTHER PARTY CAN T HEAR YOU
SCREEN ON MAP IS MORE TOUCHY THAN THE ONE ON MY PREVIOUS PRIUS
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS I OFTEN HAVE TO START OVER SEVERAL TIMES AND IT NEVER GETS IT RIGHT SO I HAVE TO PULL OUT MY PHONE AND USE GOOGLE INSTEAD ALSO A MORE INTUITIVE WAY OF SAYING YOUR DESTINATION FOR INSTANCE MY IN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM TOO SMALL HARD TO READ AND FEATURES HARD TO USE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT ACCURATE
I AM STILL LEARNING TO USE THINGS LIKE VOICE COMMAND THE CAR NEEDS TO TRAIN ME BEFORE IT WILL WORK WELL
ON OUR PREVIOUS PRIUS WE USED A SEPARATE NAVIGRATION SYSTEM SINCE IT WAS NOT BUILT INTO THE CAR I DO NOT THINK THAT BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEMS WERE AVAILABLE 10 YEARS AGO WE DO NOT LIKE THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON OUR NEW PRIUS V A
CHANGE PHONE SYSTEM SO THAT IT CAN RECOGNIZE 2 DIFFERENT PHONES AND ANSWER EITHER ONE MY PARTNER S PHONE NUMBER WAS ENTERED FIRST INTO SYSTEM IF MY PHONE RINGS AND HE IS IN THE CAR SYSTEM WILL NOT PICK UP MY PHONE EVEN THOUGH MY NUMBER WAS EN
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS HARD TO SEE WHEN IT IS LIGHT OUT AND ESPECIALLY WHEN SUNNY
I LISTEN TO XM RADIO PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVELY RIGHT NOW I LOVE IT BUT WILL NOT BE PAYING TO KEEP IT ONCE THE XM EXPIRES I WILL TRULY MISS MY MULTI CD PLAYER I AM NOT A TECHNOLOGY KIND OF GUY AND HAVE NOT YET EXPLORED ALL THAT THE VEHICLE CAN DO
CHANGE THE FACT THAT YOU MUST REMOVE A DESTINATION AFTER ARRIVAL THAT IS ONCE YOU ARRIVE HAVE THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY REMOVE THE DESTINATION SO THAT THE DIRECTIONS DON T KEEP ON BEING GIVEN VIA THE PROVIDED VOICE
VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY SLOW AND ERROR PRONE
THE HD FM TUNES IN AND OUT OFTEN NOT SURE IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF BOOST FOR THE HD RADIO
TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS ARE TOO SMALL PROGRAMMED AM AND FM STATIONS SHOULD BE ON SEPARATE SCREENS
ENTERTAINMENT CANNOT BE CONTROLLED FROM THE NAVIGATION SCREEN
NAV SYSTEM NEEDS TO ASK WHAT STATE WHAT CITY STREET AND HOUSE NUMBER
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WHILE GOOD THAT IT S STRONG HAS PICKED UP SPOUSE S PHONE WHILE IN ANOTHER CAR
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE DUE TO IT S LOCATION AND POOR VISIBILITY
WOULD HAVE PREFERRED ONSTAR TO BE INSTALLED ON MY VEHICLE EASY TO USE AND HANDS FREE
THE VOICE CONTROL ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT HAS A VERY HARD TIME WITH MY VOICE
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED BUT I AM JUST LEARNING TO USE IT
MUSIC SOUND QUALITY
CONTROLS FOR THE DVD PLAYER SHOULD BE EASIER AND MORE EXTENSIVE AND ABLE TO BE USED WITHOUT THE REMOTE CONTROL IF YOU LOSE THE REMOTE THEN A LOT OF THE CONTROLS FOR THE DVD PLAYER ARE NOT ABLE TO BE ACCESSED
MULTI CD CHANGER
HANDS FREE TALKING ALWAYS SEEM LIKE YOUR TALKING INTO A CAN THE SOUND ISN T VERY GOOD
THE BLUETOOTH IN THIS CAR SHOULD BE RECALLED IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY AND HAS BEEN TRIED ON MULTIPLE PHONES
HEADS UP DISPLAY ON WINDSHIELD H U D
SOUND QUALITY ON CALLS
I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO CALL SOMEONE IT NEVER RECOGNIZES THE NAMES IN MY PHONE BOOK AND I HAVE TO PICK UP MY PHONE TO DIAL
THE MIC FOR THE PHONE CALLS DOESN T SEEM WELL PLACED PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING ME
TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO REACH AND OPERATE WHILE DRIVING
DISPLAY AND ICONS TOO SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO READ IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A DISPLAY OF RADIO STATION NAME IN NAVIGATION MODE NAVIGATION REQUIRES TOO MANY STEPS TO SET AND CANCEL DESTINATION NICE HAVING WEATHER BUT PLEASE BRING BACK OUTSIDE TEMPE
BETTER SPEAKERS AND EQUALIZER
NAV SCREEN IS TO SMALL
I WISH MY VEHICLE COULD UNDERSTAND MY VOICE COMMANDS IT DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND MY DICTION
ABILITY TO TALK CLEARLY TO SOMEONE OVER BLUETOOTH
THE APPS DON T HAVE THE BEST REAL NEED OR USE THE APP I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IS BEING ABLE TO PUT GOOGLE MAPS ON THE SCREEN SO I GET THE LATEST MAP DATA AND NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR AN UPGRADE
THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH PHONE SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE
NEVER USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN THE PHONE WAS CONNECTED SOUND WAS NOT CLEAR
VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS A KEYPAD
WE ARE NOT TECH SAVY THE SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLICATED TOO MANY BELLS AND WHISTLES
MIRRORING OF PHONE APPLE CARPHONE CONNECTIVITY
VOICE RECOGNITION ON COMMANDS MOST FUNCTIONS I DO MANUALLY
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE DEALER UPDATED THE SOFTWARE BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT IS STILL INACCURATE MY GARMIN WORKS JUST FINE
STILL TRYING TO GET THE HANG OF CONTROLS AND HOW TO NAVIGATE THRU SYSTEM
VISIBILITY OF SCREEN
SIRIUS RADIO I NEVER KNOW WHAT STATION I M ON UNTIL I PRESS THE BUTTON AND IT COMES ON SHOULD BE A WAY TO SEE IT OTHER THAN JUST  32 ETC
THE SATELLITE RADIO HAS POOR RECEPTION AND SOMETIMES LOSES RECEPTION THIS SURPRISED ME AS I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION IT WAS SUPERIOR
DEALER FORGOT TO MENTION THAT I HAVE NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM TEXTS DOESN T WORK TOOK AWHILE TO FIND OUT THAT IT USES IPHONE6 SO THE DEALER SAYS AFTERWARDS I HAVE A IPHONE4S
SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE IPOD CONNECTED WHILE IPHONE IS CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH WHILE RUNNING ENTUNE APPS SHOULD NOT REQUIRE HAVING ENTUNE APP OPEN FOR SUPPORTING APPS
CAN T GET ANYTHING WITH AN ANDROID PHONE AND WE DON T HAVE A SMART PHONE
IF THE CONTROL PANEL IN THE APP SECTION SAYS TRAFFIC OR WEATHER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT WITHOUT HD SERVICE IF ITS THERE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE IT EVEN AFTER MY FREE TRIAL WITH XM RADIO IS UP NEVER WORKED SO I DON T NOW HOW GOOD IT IS
TOUCH CONTROLS TOO CLOSE TOGETHER AND VERY SENSITIVE
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL ENTUNE IS PRETTY WORTHLESS MUCH EASIER TO JUST USE MY PHONE FOR WHAT IT OFFERS ESPECIALLY PANDORA VIA BLUETOOTH
BETTER SOUND QUALITY ON BLUETOOTH
MORE INTUITIVE NAVIGATION CONTROLS MORE APP CHOICES MORE CONSISTENT AUDIO VOLUME BETWEEN INPUTS I E A CD MAY BE TOO LOUD AND THE RADIO NOT LOUD ENOUGH
ANDRIOD PHONE DOES NOT CONNECT USB
NAVIGATION SYSTEM GAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING DIFFICULT TO USE IF YOU DON T HAVE AN EXACT ADDRESS COULD NOT GET THE SYSTEM TO MAP US FROM ELLICOTT CITY MD TO COROLLA NC
HD RADIO WILL NOT STAY ACTIVE IT IS A VEHICLE PROBLEM AS ALL MY OTHER CARS DO NOT EXPERIENCE THIS THE HD RADIO SWITCHES BACK AND FORTH CONSTANTLY ITS ANNOYING AND IRRITATING
AUDIO SYSTEM EASY TO USE STILL GETTING USED TO ASPECTS OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE OTHER APPS WEATHER TRAFFIC ARE NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED SO I DON T REALLY USE THEM THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT SUPER SENSITIVE SO SOMETIMES I VE FAT FINGERED A BUTTON AND ACCIDENTALLY CALLED SOMEONE
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER
DISPLAY WASHES OUT VERY EASILY IN ANY TYPE OF SUNLIGHT VOICE COMMANDS FOR NAVIGATION ARE RATHER WEAK MY CELL PHONE AND MY HANDHELD NAVIGATION UNIT ARE CONSIDERABLY BETTER THAN THE INDASH UNIT
THE NAV SYSTEM IS SUB PAR GOOGLE NAV IS 100% FASTER MORE ACCURATE AND EASIER TO USE
SOUND QUALITY OF RADIO THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM WORKS FINE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM CHOICE OF ROUTE CAPABILITY CAN T MAKE A CHANGE WHILE DRIVING ABILITY TO CONNECT TO AN EXTERNAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY AND PRETTY CLUTTERED ON THE SCREEN IT S NOT A CLEAN LOOK AND SEEMS THAT TOO MUCH IS SHOVED INTO ONE OPERATING SYSTEM
MOVING AROUND THE CONTROL PANEL TO FIND RADIO STATIONS CAN BE DIFFICULT
SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT SYNC WITH MY PHONE CONTACTS AND IT TAKES AWHILE TO SYNC WITH MY PANDORA PRE SET MUSIC STATIONS
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE FIGURE OUR HOW TO LISTEN TO MUSIC OR AUDIO BOOKS FROM MY I PHONE
CONNECTING TO BLUETOOTH
QUALITY AND VOICE RECOGNITION
WHILE GIVING DIRECTIONS NAVIGATION TURN BY TURN VOICE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT LOUDER
AUDIO SYSTEM HAS ONLY 3 BAR EQUALIZER WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FINE TUNE THE SOUND FOR EXAMPLE BASS RESPONSE DOES NOT FULLY UTILIZE THE SUB WOOFER A 5 BAR EQUALIZER WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT
SEE LAST COMMENT THE TOUCHSCREEN SEEMS TO BE OF POOR QUALITY PIXELATED AND FUZZY THE GRAPHICS SEEM OUTDATED BUT THAT ISN T A PRIMARY DRIVER FOR WANTING THIS CAR SO IT S WORTH SACRIFICING TOYOTA SUBARU CLEARLY FOCUSED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT
NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM OR SATELLITE RADIO OPTIONS AVAILABLE
VEHICLE SOMETIMES HAS TROUBLE INTERPRETING HOW TO CONNECT THE PHONE S BLUETOOTH E G PLAYING MUSIC OR IMAPS AS IF THEY WERE A CALL INSTEAD OF THROUGH MUSIC
THE START UP TIME TO LOAD THE MAPS AND CONNECT TO MY PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH TAKES TOO LONG ALSO THE FORWARD BACK BUTTON WHEN USED IN THE FM RADIO MODE SHOULD GO TO THE NEXT OR PREVIOUS PRESET STATION THE FORWARD BACK BUTTON IS MORE OF A TUNER
IMPROVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND SOUND OF CALLS WHEN CALLING SOMEONE WHILE THEY ARE DRIVING MY FRIEND HAS A TOYOTA AND I CAN T UNDERSTAND A LOT OF WHAT SHE SAYS WHEN SHE IS DRIVING AND I M NOT
ON THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS DO NOT LIGHT UP AT NIGHT AND IS HARD TO SEE WOULD BE MORE CONVINIENT IF THEY HAD A BACKLIGHT TO THEM
CANT CONTROL MUSIC AND BLUETOOTH ON THE STEERING NOT STANDARD ON THIS SUPPOSEDLY SPORTS CAR
SOUND QUALITY IS POOR SOUNDS HOLLOW SPORTSCAR LIKE CAR WITH STANDARD STEREO LAME $1000 UPGRADE QUALITY WAS INSUFFICIENT TO BE WORTH PAYING FOR
AUDIO CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL SO THAT DRIVER DOES NOT HAVE TO TAKE HIS EYES OFF THE ROAD TO SELECT RADIO CHANNELS
TOUCHSCREEN IS HUGE AND DIFFICULT TO USE
JUST MAKE THE NAV SYSTEM AN INTERFACE FOR MY SMARTPHONE I WANT WHAT I SEE ON MY SMARTPHONE PROJECTED ON THE CAR S DISPLAY THAT S IT I DONT WANT TO USE YOUR SOFTWARE
YOU HAVE TWO GO THROUGH 2 TAPS TO SWITCH BETWEEN BLUETOOTH AND FM WHILE IT IS EASY TO SWTICH TO AM SETTINGS ARE ALSO CONVOLUTED BETTER ORGANIZATION AND THOUGHT ABOUT MOST USED FEATURES WOULD MAKE IT A BETTER EXPERIENCE
IT DOESN T COME WITH NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT DOES
FOR VOICE RECOGNITION CHANGE THE SOFTWARE TO THE ONE THAT HONDA IS USING IN THAT SYSTEM YO RECORD YOUR VOICE WHEN TAGGING A NAME AND THIS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FACE ANY VOICE RECOGNITION PROBLEM
YOU HAVE TO PRESS THE TOUCH SCREEN VERY HARD TO GET IT TO WORK PEOPLE CANNOT UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I USE THE PHONE
SOUND QUALITY OF PHONE SYSTEM
NAVIGATION IS NOT ACCESSIBLE   CHANGEABLE WHILE DRIVING THIS IS THE ONE TIME YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY NEED TO USE IT ALL THE OTHER FEATURES CALLING MUSIC ARE AVAILABLE AND THIS ONE IS NOT IT CAUSES MORE ISSUES TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY IT ISN T WOR
I FIND VOICE RECOGNITION NEARLY USELESS SINCE IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND ME I SPEAK WITH A CLEAR DIALECT I GET A PERSISTENT TETHER ERROR WHEN FIRST SELECTING PANDORA OR IHEART RADIO APPLICATIONS I ALSO FIND IT VERY ANNOYING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES
SOMEHOW SHADE TOUCH SCREEN FROM SUNLIGHT SPEED UP RESPONSE TO TOUCH SLOW SOFTWARE
VOLUME IS VERY WEAK ESPECIALLY ON XM STATIONS
BASS SEEMS TO OVERWHELM FACTORY WOOFERS SUBWOOFER MIGHT TAKE SOME OF THE STRAIN OFF OF THEM
BETTER QUALITY GET RID OF SIRIUSXM HATE IT
I HAD AND USED THE TOYOTA NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND MY AVALON I STOPPED USING IT SHORTLY AFTER PURCHASE AND SUBSTITUTED AN INEXPENSIVE PORTABLE DEVICE THAT WORKS MUCH BETTER I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT D NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT MUCH BETTER TH
TYPING IN ADDRESSES DO NOT LIKE THAT THE KEYBOARD DISAPPEARS WHEN THE SYSTEM THINKS IT KNOWS WHAT IS COMING NEXT TOO MANY UNUSUAL NAMES IN SOUTH TEXAS FOR THAT TO BE EFFECTED VERY FRUSTRATING
NAVIGATION SCREEN IS TOO SMALL
TOUCH SCREEN IS HARD TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING SUCH AS CHANGING CHANNELS MAYBE IF LINES WERE LARGER ALLOWING YOU TO MORE EASILY TOUCH ITEMS SUCH AS THE RADIO STATION
WHEN SWITCHING CHANNELS OR GOING FROM AM TO FM TO USB ETC IT S BE NICE TO HAVE THE TRADITIONAL BUTTONS IT S TOO DANGEROUS TO HAVE TO SCROLL UP AND DOWN
NAVIGATION NEED TO BE PRECISE VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS LOT OF IMPROVEMENT AND CORRECTIONS
WITH PASSENGER PRESENT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENTER POINT OF DESTINATION ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YOU SHOULDN T HAVE TO BE PARKED WHEN YOU HAVE A PASSENGER WHO IS ABLE TO ENTER THE INFORMATION
WOULD LIKE TO SEE ENTUNE APP SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS PHONE
SOUND QUALITY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
BETTER FUNCTION ON BACK BUTTON ON STEERING WHEEL
MAPS AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM ARE UNACCEPTABLE I HAVE ALWAYS USED A GARMEN AND FIND IT MANY MANY TIMES BETTER THAN THE TOYOTA SYSTEM I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT TRUST THE SYSTEM TO TAKE ME ON THE CORRECT ROUTE AND TO THE DESIRED LOCATION IF THERE IS ON
EASE OF TYPING IN A NEW DESTINATION WITHOUT STOPPING IF THERE IS A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT
PROVIDE INTERNET UPDATES FOR NAV SYSTEM
EASY WAY TO UPDATE NAVIGATION MAPS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS AWFUL AND BASICALLY WORTHLESS
IT IS PROVING TO BE A LITTLE COMPLICATED TO USE AND WE HAVEN T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO THE DEALER OFFERED CLASS YET IT MAY BE THAT OUR LAST NAVIGATION SYSTEM WAS SO MUCH MORE BASIC THAT THIS SEEMS DIFFICULT IN COMPARISON
THE SATELLITE CONNECTION IS WEAK AND OFTEN CUTS OUT DURING AUDIO PLAYBACK
MORE VOICE CONTROLS
WE HAVE NOT USED TYHE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM TO ANY DEGREE EXCEPT FOR THE RADIO AND GAS USE SCREEN
THE VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE IMPROVED IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MY WIFE OR I ON MANY OCCASIONS WHEN GIVING THE SYSTEM A COMMAND
NAVIGATION NOT LOUD AND CLEAR ENOUGH WHEN ON BLUETOOTH
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DID NOT GIVE CLEAR DIRECT DIRECTIONS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN SORT OF LAGGY EVERYTIME I HAVE USED IT
SIMPLIFY NAV SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE IN FINDING WHAT IS COMMANDED
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER AND FOR TECHNICAL DUMMIES LIKE ME A VERY EASY GUIDE TO USING IT
APPS DO NOT OPEN EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN DOWNLOADED AND PHONE IS CONNECTED TO THE VEHICLE SYSTEM
IT HAS NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAVIGATION DID NOT APPEAR TO COME STANDARD
I LIKE THE TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS FOR THE STEREO HOWEVER I FOUND THAT I HAVE TO LOOK AT IT TO GET THE BUTTONS I NEEDED DIFFICULT TO DO SO WHEN DRIVING SO I USUALLY DEPEND ON MY PASSENGER TO HANDLE THE MUSIC CONTROLS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND MUSIC STATIONS AND GET RID OF THE ALREADY SET STATIONS ESPECIALLY AM ONES I CANT DO THIS WHILE DRIVING SINCE IT WOULD DISTRACT ME TOO MUCH THE SOUND IS OK WHENEVER MY PHONE IS CONNECTED VIA USB IT SHOWS THAT ITS CALLING
IN THE SUN THE DISPLAY SCREEN IS HARD TO READ
MORE THAN ONE CD AT A TIME
HONESTLY IT MAY JUST BE ME BEING MIDDLE AGED BUT I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME FIGURING OUT HOW THE MENU USED FOR SETTING UP THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WORKS
SOUND FROM HANDSFREE PHONE OPERATION IS POOR TO LISTENER
UPDATES FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE FORTHCOMING AND FREE FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE USER UPDATED NOT DEALERSHIP
USB CONNECTOR MAKES NO SENSE REGULAR USB PORT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER WITH IT I CAN CHARGE THE PHONE AND ALSO LISTEN TO MUSIC THE CABLE I GOT FROM DEALER ONLY SUPPORTS OLD IPOD I HAVE ANDROID PHONE
NO USB PORT
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PHONE CALLS
NEEDS USB PORTS
HEAVY IMPROVEMENT NEEDED IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM COMPATIBILITY NEEDED FOR OTHER IPHONE MUSIC APPS IE SPOTIFY
THERE IS NO USB PORT THE SD CARD IS 32G MAX A 64G CARD WILL NOT WORK SOME OF THE AUDIO CONTROLS ARE DIFFERENT THAN MOST CARS SO IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET USED TO THEM
GIVE US A USB PORT FOR OUR PHONES
ABILITY FOR THE BLUETOOTH TO CHANGE BETWEEN LISTENING TO MUSIC AND READING TEXTS IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT DISCONNECTING AND RECONNECTING THE BLUETOOTH WHICH IS VERY INCONVENIENCE
I HAVEN T READ THE MANUAL BUT SO FAR THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM ISN T VERY HELPFUL AND IT S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ME WHEN I CALL THEM USING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION BECAUSE OF THE SURROUNDING NOISE
THE NAVIGATION COMPARED TO GOOGLE MAPS ON OUR PHONES IS AVERAGE OR LESS THEN AVERAGE AT BEST MANY UNIQUE CHICAGO ADDRESSES ARE NOT IN THE DATABASE
BE ABLE TO RECEIVE AND SEND TEXT MESSAGES VIA BLUETOOTH
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT REQUIRES FOR THE ENTERING OF EXACT ADDRESS WITH ALL THE APPLICABLE DIRECTIONS IT IS NOT VERY FLEXIBLE IN RE TO THE RIGIDNESS OF THE SYSTEM IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING IN THE BEGINNING
FOR THE NAV SYSTEM IT S NOT INTUITIVE HOW TO GO BACK IF YOU ENTER AN ADDRESS WRONG
NOT SURE HOW ANYTHING WORKS EXCEPT RADIO AND BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE I AM NOT TECH SAVVY
BETTER SCREEN QUALITY ON TOUCH SCREEN IT LOOKS VERY PIXELY
PHONE CONNECTIVITY WIRED
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SLOW AND GRAPHICS ARE LOW RESOLUTION COULD ALSO USE A LARGER SCREEN
SOME NAVIGATION MENUS COULD BE MORE INFORMATIVE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THIS CAR IS TERRIBLE
THE NAV UNIT IS THE WEAK SISTER I D HAVE PAID FOR A BETTER ONE
TOUCHSCREEN RADIO PRE SET STATION CONTROL HAS TINY RED BARS TO SCROLL THRU THE PRESET SCREENS THESE ARE HARD TO SEE AND TOUCH WHILE DRIVING
WOULD LOVE REAL TIME TRAFFIC INFO ON THE MAP RED YELLOW GREEN ROUTE INDICATORS SOMETIMES VOLUME ISN T LOUD ENOUGH ON STEREO ESPECIALLY MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH OR PHONE PORT
EITHER UPDATE THE AUX CORD THAT COMES WITH THE VEHICLE TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW IPHONE MODELS OR JUST USE A USB CORD
THE SPEAKERS ARE AWFUL AND THE STREAMING OF MUSIC FROM MY CELL PHONE THROUGH THE CARS SPEAKERS IS AWFUL THE SPEAKERS ARE OKAY WITH RADIO AND CD ALMOST ACCEPTABLE BUT STEAMING MUSIC FROM MY CELL PHONE IS AWFUL AND I HATE IT MY HUSBAND HAS REF
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT AS GOOD OVERALL AS OUR 2000 MODEL YEAR MERCEDES BENZ ML430 IT IS A BIT LESS THAN UP TO DATE THE SCREEN IS TOO SMALL THE GRAPHICS ARE RUDIMENTARY AND THE CONTROLS ARE CONFUSING AND NOT AT ALL INTUITIVE
PANDORA   APPLE RADIO COMPATIBILITY READ TEXT FACILITY
USB PORT INSTEAD OF MMI
SWITCH TO A USB CONNECTION RATHER THAN A PROPRIETARY SINGLE COMPANY CONNECTION I WILL DRIVE MY CAR FOR 10 YEARS AND I M STUCK WITH WHATEVER DONGLE WORKS WITH APPLE TODAY NO OTHER OPTIONS AND VW CAN T GUARANTEE APPLE WILL ALWAYS USE THAT SHAP
THE VOICE CONTROLS COULD DO WITH SOME SORT OF TUTOR WHILE IT S GOOD AT NOT ACCIDENTALLY DOING THINGS WHEN IT S UNCERTAIN THE LEARNING CURVE FOR SOMEONE NOT USED TO USING A VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM MEANS IT S NOT USED THAT MUCH IT FEELS LIKE A M
IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SELECT A TOUCH SCREEN ITEM WHEN THE CAR IS MOVING
TYPING IN DESTINATIONS IN THE NAVI SYSTEM IS ONEROUS THE TOP DOWN STATE CITY FIRST APPROACH IS DUMB
I DRIVE ALONE ALMOST ALL THE TIME AND HAVING TO FIND MY WAY THROUGH THE NAV SYSTEM WHILE TRYING TO DRIVE WAS MORE THAN I WAS WILLING TO ENDURE I USE MY PHONE I PRETTY MUCH STICK TO FM RADIO FOR AUDIO AND THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE OF THE RADIO
ISTALL USB PORTS TO CONNECT TO USE AND CHARGE PHONE
USB PORTS RATHER THAN PROPRIETARY CONNECTION TO IPHONE IPOD
DOES NOT HAVE USB PORT
CAR SHOULD HAVE USB PORTS
SUPPORT FOR APPLE CARPLAY
WOULD LIKE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY
ADD USB PORTS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY SLOW MAPS ON NEW CAR SEEM OUTDATED CELL PHONE APP SCOUT IS MORE UP TO DATE AND ACCURATE NEW VEHICLE CAME EQUIPPED WITH 30 PIN IPHONE ADAPTOR FOR IPHONE 4 & OLDER IPHONE 5 W LIGHTNING ADAPTOR WAS RELEASE
JUST MAKE THE IN DASH UNIT AN EXTERNAL DISPLAY   ENTRY SYSTEM FOR MY ANDROID PHONE
RESOLUTION OF THE TOUCH SCREEN COULD BE BETTER
WHEN YOU GO TO ENTER AN ADDRESS OR LOCATION IN THE NAVIGATION IT TAKES THE INFORMATION IN AN ODD ORDER I WOULD LIKE TO PUT IN THE FULL ADDRESS FORWARD NOT BACKWARDS
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED SHE DOES NOT OFTEN HEAR YOUR COMMANDS CORRECTLY EVEN WHEN TRYING TO BE CLEAR I HAVE NOT YET UTILIZED VOICE COMMANDS FOR CLIMATE CONTROL OR RADIO USAGE
A FASTER ANIMATION WHEN CHANGING PAGES OF PRESET RADIO CHANNELS WOULD BE NICE CAN BE SLUGGISH
GRAPHICS OF NAVIGATION ARE DATED AND IT IS SLOW TO REACT TO COMMANDS SUCH AS ZOOM IN
NAV NEEDS TO BE ACCURATE WOULD LIKE MORE OPTIONS TO + DISPLAY I AM 77 YEARS OLD SO DO NOT HEAR WELL BAD JUDGE OF AUDIO QUALITY NAVIGATION SYSTEM SLOW TO BOOT UP
THE MAP ZOOM INCREMENTS ARE TOO LARGE
SOMETIMES THE PERSON I AM SPEAKING WITH VIA BLUETOOTH SAYS THAT MY VOICE ISN T COMING THROUGH CLEARLY
SMALL TOUCH SCREEN DIFFICULT TO USE BIGGER SCREEN WITH HIGHER DEFINITION IS MUCH NEEDED SOUND WITH STANDARD AUDIO SYSTEM ACCEPTABLE BUT NOT OUTSTANDING
USB PORTS
SEND DESTINATIONS TO NAVIGATION SYSTEM FROM SMARTPHONE
TOUCH SCREEN PROXIMITY SENSOR IS GREAT HOWEVER SOME OF THE TOUCH BUTTONS ARE SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO FIND TOUCH WHILE DRIVING REQUIRING ME TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD MORE THAN I LIKE I HAVE MEMORIZED THE LOCATION OF THE MORE FREQUENTLY USED TOU
VOICE SYSTEM IS UNACCEPTABLE NAVIGATION IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER USED IT SOUNDS GOOD BUT THE VOICE NAV AND TRAFFIC ARE BASICALLY USELESS I MEAN I HATE HAVING TO INTERACT WITH THE SYSTEM SO I DON T IT S EMBARRASSING WHEN OTHERS ARE IN MY
WIDER BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY TO OLDER CELL PHONES
DON T LIKE CD PLAYER BEING IN GLOVEBOX BASICALLY NEVER USE
TOO MANY DISTRACTIONS
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE COME ACROSS SO FAR IS WITH THE BLUETOOTH FUNCTION WHILE TRYING TO USE DIFFERENT MEDIA SUCH AS CD AND THEN BEING ABLE TO USE NAVIGATION AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE IT CONNECTED FOR CALLS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR THE NAVIGATION
IPAD CONNECTOR WOULD BE NICE
VOICE RECOGNITION CORRECTLY UNDERSTANDING THE COMMAND WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A PHONE CALL
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE A LOT BETTER IT ISN T REAL TIME AND IT DOESN T STAY UPDATED AT ALL
THE ICONS ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ARE NOT CLEAR AS TO WHAT THEY MEAN I DON T USE THEM OFTEN ENOUGH TO KNOW WHICH ICON DOES WHAT BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE
SAT RADIO INTERFACE IS CLUNKY
LINK BETWEEN NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND TRAFFIC DATA
SOUND SYSTEM RADIO CD PLAYER SIRIUS RADIO WILL SKIP STATIONS WHEN ROLLING OVER BUMPS THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN
THE OPERATIONS USING STEERING CONTROLS AT TIMES IS CONFUSING WE NEED BETTER POSITIONING OF CONTROLS
CONSOLE IS DATED AND COULD USE A TECHNOLOGY UPGRADE MONOCHROME COLORS NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED TOUCHSCREEN NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED MUST PRESS AND HOLD LONGER THAN NECESSARY FOR PRESSES TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED
THE VOICE CONTROL IS TOUCHY AT TIMES AND I HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF
THE NAV AND AUDIO SYSTEMS ARE NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY
MAKE CD PLAYER EASIER TO ACCESS
TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO OPERATE SOMETIMES CAN TAKE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO GET A BUTTON TO RESPOND NAVIGATING THROUGH SAVED RADIO STATIONS IS CUMBERSOME
THE INTERFACE IS GREAT HOWEVER WHEN ON NAVIGATION MODE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE MORE INFO VISIBLE ABOUT WHAT SONG IS PLAYING CURRENTLY THE NAVIGATION ONLY DISPLAYS WHICH CHANNEL YOU RE LISTENING TO MY FIANCéE S MERCEDES BENZ DISPLAYS FULL SO
VOICE RECOGNITION OFTEN INACCURATE DUE TO OUTSIDE NOISE
THERE IS NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND I CANNOT USE THE NAVIGATION ON MY PHONE WHILE BLUETOOTH IS ENABLED
PHONE CONNECTIVITY AUDIO QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD
NAV SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY TOO DIFFICULT TO ENTER ADDRESS SMARTPHONE TECH IS WHAT I USUALLY DEFER TO
TOUCH SCREEN WOULD IMPROVE IT AND HAVING ONE WAY TO GET TO SELECT ONE FUNCTION THERE IS A DIFFERENT BUTTON FOR EACH FUNCTION NOT EASY TO FIND
SWITCH BETWEEN FM AND SATELLITE NOT AS SMOOTH AS PREVIOUS VEHICLE S SYSTEM
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE NEEDS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE FULL ROUTE AND ZOOM FEATURE ON MAP SHOULD BE CONTROLLED BY SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE NUMBER KEY PAD AUDIO BETTER RECEPTION OF HD AND INTERNET
HARD TO NAVIGATE
MOST TIMES THAN NOT THE SYSTEM DOES NOT COMMUNICATE WITH MY IPHONE VIA BLUETOOTH SO THEREFORE MOST TIMES THAN NOT I CAN T LISTEN TO MY OWN MUSIC
WOULD LIKE TOUCH SCREEN
THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE RADIO COULD BE IMPROVED
I LIKE THE VOICE CONTROL FOR CHANGING AM FM SIRIUS I LIKE SIRIUS BUT WITH THE AMOUNT OF ADDS ON THE STATIONS I M SURPRISED THERE IS A SUBSCRIPTION FEE
MANUALLY ENTERING ADDRESSES FOR NAVIGATION IS A TEDIOUS TIME CONSUMING PROCESS
WHEN I RENT FORD VEHICLES THE SYNC APPLICATION IS OR APPEARS TO BE SO MUCH MORE ADVANCED THAN VOLVO S I VE OFTEN SAID THAT IF YOU IMPROVE ANYTHING IMPROVE UPON THIS SYSTEM MAKE IT SO THAT IT CAN BE UPDATED WITH NEW FEATURES DO NOT WANT TO
IT NEEDS TO BE MORE SIMPLISTIC THE SCREENS ARE TOO BUSY IT CAN BE VERY DISTRACTING IT HAS TO BE AN EASIER WAY TO PUT AN ADDRESS IN THE SYSTEM WITHOUT HAVING TO REFER TO THE MANUAL I SHOULDN T HAVE TO USE MY I PHONE FOR DRIVING DIRECTIONS WHEN
I DON T USE THE NAV SYSTEM I USE WAZE I DON T NEED SUNROOF OR NAV SYSTEM
THE QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD FOR A FACTORY INSTALLED SYSTEM I PICKED UP THE PREMIUM AUDIO SYSTEM AND HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS THOUGH I FOUND THE BUILT IN SOUND PROFILES REALLY SUCKED AND WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE STEREO SYSTE
WOULD BE HIGHER BUT NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE
BLUETOOTH IS PERFECT
IPHONE 6 IS UNABLE TO CONNECT USING MDI PORT
CD SHOULD PLAY WHEN INSERT IN SLOT WITHOUT HAVING TO FIND APPROPRIATE MENU
CONNECTIVITY AND VOICE RECOGNITION NEED TO BE IMPROVED
I WOULD BE NICE IF THE NAV HAD A TOUCH SCREEN
WE ALSO HAVE A TOYOTA SIENNA WITH NAV WE FEEL THE TOYOTA SYSTEM IS EASIER TO USE
EASE OF USE WHEN IN ANOTHER MODE SUCH AS CALLING SOMEONE WHEN IN NAVIGATION OR CHANGING A RADIO STATION OR SATELLITE CHANNEL WHEN USING THE PHONE MODE
BLUETOOTH MICROPHONE IS OVER DRIVERS HEAD SO HARD TO HEAR IF PASSENGER IS TALKING VIA BLUETOOTH
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS PRETTY BAD ALSO THE VOLVO ON CALL APP LOCKS DOORS REMOTE START STINKS TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY
THE NAV
I HAVE USED THE NAV SYSTEM ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE ROUTES DIRECTED WERE OUT OF THE WAY AND A LONGER TRAVEL TIME REQUIRED
VOICE COMMAND
I AM NOT A FAN OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN PARTICULAR THE AUDIO PART IS ANNOYING AND DISTRCTING I RARELY USE IT
NAVIGATION OFTEN GIVES WRONG STREET NAME WHEN INDICATING TURNS GIVES ONE S CURRENT STREET HIGHWAY INSTEAD OF THE NAME OF THE STREET ONTO WHICH YOU ARE TURNING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS IS NOT EASY TO USE NEED ASSISTANCE LEARNING HOW TO USE THIS DEVICE TO GET AROUND THE VOLVO NAVIGATION SYSTEM I USE MY IPHONE TO NAVIGATE SO MUCH EASIER
THE CAR DOES NOT HAVE BUILT IN GARAGE DOOR OPENERS AS A STANDARD FEATURE A BIG MISS IN MY EYES
APP SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW AND CLUNKY PROCESSOR RESPONSIVENESS
NAV SYSTEM VOICE COMMAND INTERPRETATION OF MY VOICE IS VERY POOR ALMOST NEVER CORRECT EVEN THOUGH I USED THE INSTALLED VOICE TRAINING APP
WE WANT TO PLAY AUDIBLE BOOKS ON OUR I PAD THRU THE USB PORT AS WE USED TO DO IN OUR CHEV EQUINOX
AGAIN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE SYSTEM PARTICULARLY SWITCHING WITHIN THE SATELLITE RADIO
NAV IS A BIT COMPLICATED TO USE ONE TIME I HAD INCORRECT INFO DISPLAYED
VOICE CONTROL IS A MYSTERY LIKE ON EVERY OTHER CAR I VE OWNED WITH THIS FEATURE IT WORKS EASILY FOR THE PHONE BUT IS AWKWARD AND DIFFICULT TO USE FOR NAVIGATION AND OTHER FEATURES
THE NAV IS NOT AS INTUITIVE AS OTHERS I VE USED SWITCHING BETWEEN SYSTEMS IS CONFUSING
IMPROVE GREATLY MANUAL INPUT OF DATA INTO NAVIGATION SYSTEM TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE A SOLUTION
HOW TO HELP OLDER DRIVERS WITH THE INCREDIBLE TECH AVAILABLE IN THE CAR IT S ALMOST OVERWHELMING THE SALES PERSON DID HIS BEST TO EXPLAIN BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO REFERENCE SUBJECTS OF MOST IMPORTANCE IN THE MANUALS FOR LOWER TECH FOL
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD RECOGNIZE SIMPLE SPOKE LOCATIONS SUCH AS JUST SAYING 123 MAIN ST ANYTOWN AND IT SHOULD RECOGNIZE IT
CONTINUALLY CHARGE THE IPOD WHILE PLAYING DRIVING
CHANGING RADIO STATION IS DIFFICULT WHEN DRIVING
ABILITY TO SWITCH BETWEEN MUSIC AND PHONE FROM TOUCH BUTTON ON STEERING WHEEL WITHOUT REACHING OVER TO RADIO ABILITY TO CONTROL IPOD FROM STEERING WHEEL
INPUT OF THE ADDRESS WHEN NOT USING VOICE ACTIVATION SHOULD BE EASIER THAN THE DIAL SYSTEM FOR NAVIGATING FROM LETTER TO LETTER
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
I WISH THE RADIO CONTROLS WERE TOUCH SCREEN I VE GOTTEN USED TO THE WHEEL CONTROL BUT REALIZE THAT IT IS A BIT MORE INCONVENIENT THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
THE VOICE COMMAND AND NAVIGATION IS ACTUALLY SO DIFFICULT IT IS ANNOYING AND USUALLY END UP TOTALLY FRUSTRATED WHEN TRYING TO US IT OFTEN CHOOSE SMART PHONE OPTION THROUGH USB TO ACCOMPLISH SAME IN 10% OF THE TIME TO SET A DESTINATION
NAVIGATION LOCATE DIRECTIONS BY BUSINESS NAME
NAVIGATION SYSTEM COMPLEX
USED TO GARMIN GPS WHICH ALERTS YOU FASTER WHEN TO GET OFF E G IN ONE MILE TURN RIGHT
WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH VOICE ACTIVATION IT FEELS LIKE I ALWAYS HAVE TO YELL AT IT AND IT HAS DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING THE NAME S I AM ASKING FOR
WE DO NOT LET THESE TYPES OF DEVICE INTERFERE WITH OUR DRIVING WE PLAY CD S OR LISTEN TO FM OR SAT> RADIO BOTH DRIVERS DO NOT WANT TO BE DISTRACTED FROM IMPORTANT DRIVING TASK FEATURES ARE NICE BUT DO NOT WANT TO BE DISTRACTED WHILE DRIVING
IT IS EASY TO USE AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD
EASE OF ENTERING ADDRESSES
EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A PERFORMANCE VEHICLE THE BASE AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD BE OF HIGHER QUALITY SUCH AS THE BOSE SYSTEM ON OTHER 911 S
IPHONE COMPATIBILITY
I DO NOT HAVE A CELL PHONE I DO HAVE AN EXTERNAL BUT CONNECTED 12 DISC PLAYER THAT I USE VERY OFTEN FOR MUSIC AND BOOKS ON CD I DO NOT USE THE HAV SYSTEM TO HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE IT WOULD HAVE BEN A GREATER HELP FOR A VISUAL CD OR VERB
NAVIGATION IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY GARMAN
THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED FROM THIS CAR
THE SCREEN NEEDS TO BE LARGER IT SHOULD HAVE THE EMERGENCY LOCAL WEATHER CHANNEL ANYWHERE IN THE USA LESS SCREEN GLARE EASIER TO READ WITH POLARIZED SUNGLASSES WIFI THE SYSTEM SHOULD UPDATE ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR FREE JUST LIKE MY IPHONE NOT
LOADING CD IS TOO TIME CONSUMING
I DO NOT LIKE THAT EVERYTHING MUST BE CONTROLLED THROUGH THE TOUCH SCREEN IT IS NOT RESPONSIVE AND THERE ARE TOO MANY STEPS
I THINK I DO NOT LIKE MULTIPLE CLICKS AND I ALSO I DID NOT UPGRADE THE AUDIO SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM CAN BE DIFFICULT TO USE NOT AS USER FRIENDLY AS IT SHOULD BE
SYSTEM HAS GREAT FEATURES AND I LOVE WHAT WORKS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO TAKE THE BEST ROUTES COMPARED TO GOOGLE MAPS OR WAZE JAGUAR APPS DON T SEEM USEFUL AND DON T REALLY WORK MOST OF THE APPS ARE EXPENSIVE FROM WHAT I VE SEEN
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS NOT GREAT NAVIGATION IS INFERIOR TO GOOGLE MAPS AND SHOULD JUST LINK FROM YOUR PHONE DIRECTLY TO THE SCREEN
RESPONSE TIME OF TOUCH SCREEN
KEEP LOSING CONNECTION TO SATELLITE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SUCKS LOOK TO LEXUS FOR IMPROVING THE DRIVERS INTERFACE AND EASE OF USE
SLOW TO INPUT ADDRESSES IN NAV SCREEN NOT ALWAYS THE MOST EFFICIENT ROUTE
THE GRAPHICS ARE NOT THAT GREAT I HAVE SEEN OTHER NAV SYSTEM IN OTHER CARS THAT ARE MUCH BETTER WHEN YOU TRY TO TYPE A POINT OF INTEREST IT WILL TRY TO GUESS THE LETTERS AND MOST OF THE TIME WILL NOT ALLOW YOU TO TYPE THE WHOLE NAME OF THE PLACE
WISH THERE IS AN ABILITY TO SAVE CONTACT ADDRESSES INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION
SIRIUS XM IS AN EVIL THING CONSIDERED IN ANY LIGHT
HAVING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY ALSO INCLUDE HANDS FREE VOICE CONTROL VIA A CONTROL IN THE CAR EITHER IN THE DASHBOARD OR STEERING WHEEL PREFERABLY THE STEERING WHEEL
I GIVE THIS AN OVERALL AVERAGE SCORE BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE THE AUDIO SYSTEM THIS IS NO REFLECTION ON THE SALESMAN WHO WENT OVER IT WITH ME WHAT IS NEEDED IS AN OPERATING MANUAL FOR THE ELECTRONICS SYSTEMS
TERRIBLE SYSTEM IT HAS TOO MANY GLITCHES SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT THOUGH
RECOGNITION OF NAMES OF CONTACTS CARPLAY IPHONE CONNECTIVITY SHOULD BE A MUST
MORE KNOB CONTROLLED ITEMS LESS TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLLED ITEMS
VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
MAKE THE AUX OPTION EASIER TO FIND OR LOCATE I MIGHT EVEN GO AS FAR AS EVEN PUTTING IN A BUTTON SPECIFICALLY FOR THE AUX PORT OPTION
BETTER BLUETOOTH COMMUNICATION WHEN SPEAKING THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END HAS DIFFICULTY HEARING MY CONVERSATION
THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM HAS A COMPONENT IN EACH SEAT AND THEY ALL PLAY THE SAME THING HAVING THEM PLAY DIFFERENT THINGS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL ADDITIONALLY I CANNOT LET THE KIDS LISTEN TO THAT WHILE I LISTEN IT IS ALL THE SAME THING TO
THERE COULD BE MORE ACCESS TO INFOTAIMENT PANDORA INTERNET WIFI
CALLERS CANNOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING FROM DRIVER S END DURING CELL PHONE BLUETOOTH CONVERSATIONS
NOT LEADFING EDGE EVEN FORD SYNC IS MORE ADVANCED
NAVIGATION GRAPHICS
ALLOW THE PASSENGER TO USE THE CONTROLS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING THIS COULD BE TURNED ON WHEN THE PASSENGER AIRBAG IS ENABLED VERY EASILY
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
THE HANDS FREE VOLUME CONTROL NEEDS TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO TOUCH
PANDORA IHEART OR SPOTIFY APPS BUILT IN WOULD IMPROVE THE EXPERIENCE
NAVIGATION IS FRUSTRATING WHEN DRIVING BECAUSE IT WON T ALLOW YOU TO PUSH BUTTONS UNLESS STOPPED WE JUST USE OUR PHONES WHICH UPDATE AUTOMATICALLY
BASE MODEL DOES NOT HAVE NAVIGATION
HAVING LARGE CENTER SPEAKER IS AN UNUSUAL CONFIGURATION THAT TOOK GETTING USED TO IT TENDS TO OVERPOWER THE SOUND COMING FROM THE SIDES LESSENING THE STEREO EFFECT THE USABILITY OF A USB MEMORY STICK MENU SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED
THE APPS DO NOT SUPPORT BLACKBERRY PHONES AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE NISSAN CONNECT CANNOT SEEM TO GET THE APPS TO LOAD HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO CALL OR TAKE TO THE DEALER FOR ASSISTANCE COULD BE JUST OPERATOR ERROR WISH IT HAD MORE APPS AND NOT SURE IF IT CAN BE USED AS A HOTSPOT
THE HANDS FREE SPEAKER SYSTEM IS NOT VIABLE OVER 50MPH THE MICROPHONE PICKS UP WAY TO MUCH ROAD WIND NOISE MAKING IT NEARLY UNUSABLE THE IPHONE CONTROLS NEED TO BE MORE INTUITIVE BUT OVER ALL I ENJOY THE SYSTEM
NISSAN FAVORS APPLE PRODUCTS THIS IS ANNOYING SINCE I M A ANDROID USER NOT APPLE USER
IT S A BASIC AM FM RADIO WITH CD PLAYER THAT FOR ME IS FINE AND NEEDS NO IMPROVEMENT
CAN T USE ANY APP OTHER THAN GOOGLE SEARCH THROUGH THE SYSTEM S TOUCHSCREEN A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT
EASY TO READ BUTTONS AND LIKE THE USE OF TOUCH SCREEN
NAMES OF FUNCTIONS ARE CONFUSING TO ME DON T UNDERSTAND ROUTING VS DESTINATION CAN T CANCEL FUNCTIONS IT KEEPS TELLING ME ABOUT NEARBY WEATHER WHEN I START THE CAR DON T KNOW HOW TO STOP THAT SHOULD HAVE A BUTTON TO TURN IT OFF WHILE DRIV
VOICE RECOGNITION IS HORRIBLE AND EASE OF USE WOULD HAVE BEEN POOR 10 YEARS AGO TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE IN TODAYS MARKEY NAVIGATION IS SUB PAR AS WELL
I HAD TO INSTALL A PORTABLE SIRUS XM RADIO SCION DOES NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO INCLUDE IT IN CAR THEY SHOULD CHANGE THAT
THE SOUND QUALITY OF CALLS
THE RATING I GAVE ARE FOR THE STOCK RADIO PRIOR TO REPLACING IT WITH AN AFTERMARKET SINCE I COULD NOT USE THE BLUETOOTH AND VOICE SYSTEMS SINCE I DON T HAVE AN APPLE DEVICE I COULDN T PROVIDE MUCH INSIGHT THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO USE
ABILITY TO CONTROL POPULAR APS LIKE PANDORA OR SPOTIFY THROUGH INTERFACE INSTEAD OF PHONE ALSO THE SCREEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISPLAY THE SONG AND ARTIST FOR THE SONGS PLAYING
SHOULD COME STOCK WITH SATELLITE RADIO
SPEAKER SOUND QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED SOME ASPECTS FEEL A BIT MUFFLED COMPARED TO PREVIOUS TC S FOR EXAMPLE MORE CONTROL OVER EQ SETTINGS WOULD BE A BIG IMPROVEMENT ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR PRESET EQ SETTINGS CLEAN ROCK
BETTER MAP
MIC FOR BLUETOOTH IS NOT VERY GOOD SOUND QUALITY DURING CALLS IS POOR AT BEST
SPEAKERS ARE QUIET AND BECOME DISTORTED WHEN VOLUME INCREASES SCION BOASTS ABOUT HAVING PIONEER FACTORY SYSTEMS BUT TO BE HONEST IVE SEEN BETTER IN CHEAPER CARS
VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR POSSIBLY FROM THE NOISE INSIDE THE CAR WHEN MOVING
DO NOT LIKE HAVING TO OPEN GLOVE BOX TO CONNECT USB PORT
MAKE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM STOP AUTO COMPLETING THE NAME OF THE CITY WHICH IS USUALLY WRONG AND THEN I AM UNABLE TO TYPE IN THE CORRECT ONE
SOUND WITH COMMUNICATIONS
THE BLUETOOTH PICKS UP A LOT OF INTERIOR NOISE WHEN ON THE HIGHWAY
THE ACCURACY OF THE DESTINATIONS
NO COMPLAINTS EASY TO USE AND SOUNDS GREAT FENDER SPEAKERS
NAV SYSTEM SHOULD GIVE STREET BY STREET TURNS I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE STREET OR ROAD I AM ON
NAVIGATION IS INACCURATE SCREEN TOO SMALL HARD TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE TO TURN PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL EVENT
VOICE ACTIVATED PHONE REQUIRES THAT I KNOW EXACTLY HOW THAT NAME IS WRITTEN ON MY PHONE BIGGEST FRUSTRATION WHEN CALLING MY FAVORITES THAT I KNOW THE NUMBER ALONG WITH THEIR NAME ON THE PHONE OTHERWISE IT WON T GO THRU
IT WORKS FINE VOICE NAVIGATION IS DIFFUCULT
NAVIGATION MAP IS LIMITED IN VIEW SIZE SCREEN IS TO SMALL VOICE RECOGNITION IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING CAR NEED TO LEARN HOW TO RECOGNIZE THE DRIVER VOICE OR ACCENTAND ADAPT EVENTUALLY ASK IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WORD IS CORRECT LIKE ON THE
NOT REALLY HAPPY WITH CHANGING STATIONS ON RADIO WITH STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
VOICE RECOGNITION ONLY UNDERSTANDS THINGS ABOUT HALF THE TIME
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION FOR A MORE HANDS FREE EXPERIENCE NOWADAYS TIME IN THE CAR IS FILLED WITH BANKING COMMUNICATING TO VENDORS AND GETTING TASKS DONE THE DRIVE IS MY TIME TO MAKE CALLS I DON T HAVE TIME FOR SO HAVING AN EXCEPTIONAL SYSTEM
ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE VEHICLE
MAYBE FREE UPDATES TO DISPLAY AND SYSTEM BUT OVERALL THE SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING
NAVIGATION WORKS IF YOU HAVE THE ADDRESS BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC PLACE WITHOUT THE ADDRESS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THE POI AND SEARCH FUNCTION FOR A STORE RESTAURANT ETC IS USELESS
I LIKE TO SEE CD ALBUM COVER GRAPHICS ASSOCIATED WITH SONGS PLAYED FROM EXTERNAL DEVICE IPHONE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN SPLIT WITH MAP
THE VOLUME ON THE NAV IS VERY QUIET I AM SURE I JUST NEED TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT BUT HAVEN T GOTTEN THE BOOK OUT TO FIGURE IT OUT YET
THE INTERFACE IS OUTDATED I WOULD PREFER CARPLAY INTEGRATION AND LEVERAGE MY IPHONE
NAVIGATION IS FAR BEHIND THE COMPETITION IN SIZE OF SCREEN AND GRAPHICS PORSCHE AND THE INDUSTRY KNOW THIS
NEED BETTER AUDIO SYSTEM IT IS SUB STANDARD COMPARE TO OTHER CAR MAKERS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY
THIS IS THE SINGLE WORST PART OF THE CAR THE SYSTEM IS NON INTUITIVE AND FRUSTRATING TO USE MAYBE 10 YEARS AGO IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OK BUT WHEN I HAVE BEEN USING AN IPHONE SINCE IT IS JUST FRUSTRATING PORSCHE NEEDS TO HIRE APPLE TO HELP
I WISH I WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN TO OPERATE MY IPHONE PLAYLIST MUSIC
EASE OF USE OF OWNERS MANUAL THE CONTINUOUS REFERRAL BACK AND FORTH AND LIMITED EXPLANATIONS I VE HAD BETTER SUCCESS UTILIZING GOOGLE TO ASSIST IN LEARNING THE OPERATION OF SEVERAL DEVICES
VOLUME VARIES MARKEDLY BETWEEN DIFFERENT MEDIA SOURCES E G IPOD VERSUS IPHONE MENU ON TOUCH SCREEN SEEMS TO HAVE INCONSISTENT TOUCH SENSITIVITY NO WAY FOR COMMUNICATION CENTER TO BE PROGRAM NOT COME ONE WHEN STARTING THE CAR
STANDARD SPEAKERS AND TUNER SHOULD BE AN UPMARKET BRAND SUCH AS BOSE
THE BOSE SYSTEM IS NOT AUDIOPHILE QUALITY SOUND
I DON T LIKE THAT I CAN T CHANGE THE SATELLITE STATIONS FROM MY STEERING WHEEL ONLY THE ONES THAT I HAVE MARKED AS FAVORITES
MAKE ENTRY OF DESTINATIONS MORE USER FRIENDLY AND CHANGING SCALE ON THE MAP
EASE OF USE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM AND THE NAV SYSTEM COULD BE BETTER
WHEN SELECTING A NEW ADDRESS NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD DEFAULT TO THE STATE WHERE THE CAR IS LOCATED
TECHNOLOGY IS WAY DOWN THE LIST IN ENGINEERING FOR THIS CAR
A CAR THAT COSTS THIS MUCH SHOULD HAVE BLUETOOTH MUSIC STREAMING BUILT IN
PHONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION SHOULD STAY ON EVEN WHEN PCM RADIO NAVI IS TURNED OFF
THE NAVIGATION
TOUCH SCREEN NAVIGATION WITH MORE KNOWLEDGE ON PLACES IN THE AREA
NAVIGATION IS A LITTLE BIT OF HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND USE
NEEDS SUPPORT FOR ANDROID VIA USB SUPPORTS IPOD ONLY ANDROID IS 50% OF MARKET
MY PHONE WON T SYNC PROPERLY WITH THE SYSTEM IT S BECAUSE IT S AN IPHONE AND HONDA ACURA WON T PAY APPLE FOR LICENSING IT HAS RUINED THE CAR FOR ME
SINCE I LISTEN TO MY IPOD THE MOST WHEN I CONNECTED THROUGH THE USB PORT I WOULD LIKE THE SYSTEM TO WORK LIKE MY IPOD DOES FOR EXAMPLE I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH MY WHOLE SONG LIST USING THE CONTROLS ON MY CAR BECAUSE IT TAKES TOO
I CAN NOT USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE I M DRIVING PASSENGER TRIED TO USE IT WHILE I WAS DRIVING
BASE STEREO SYSTEM IS NOT OF GREAT QUALITY UPGRADED OPTIONS WERE TOO PRICEY
EASIER USE OF MAKING PHONE CALLS AND ENTERING ADDRESSES FOR THE NAV SYSTEM
TERRIBLE SOUND QUALITY FROM THE STANDARD STEREO SPEAKERS UNACCEPTABLE FOR A CAR COSTING THIS MUCH
WOULD LIKE TO USE TRAFFIC APPS EG WAZE IN THE CAR S BLUETOOTH
IT IS DIFFICULT TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE YOU CAN T LOOK TO SEE WHAT YOU ARE TOUCHING I LIKE THE LOOK OF THE TOUCH SCREEN BUT IT ISN T AS GREAT AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
THE NAVIGATION IS TOO DIFFICULT TO USE I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE TRAFFIC ALERTS AND THE DIRECTIONS ARE HARD TO FOLLOW I WOULD RATHER USE MY CELL PHONE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS ITS FASTER AND EASIER TO USE
NEED TRAINING TO USE VOICE COMMANDS PROPERLY HARD WITHOUT A REAL MANUAL
SYSTEM DOESN T ALLOW ALBUM NAVIGATION ON BLUETOOTH CONNECTED ANDROID PHONE THIS WORKED WELL ON MY PREVIOUS CAR A AUDI A7
MAPS ARE TERRIBLE WRONG DESTINATIONS USELESS
FOR SAFETY REASONS TOO MUCH OF THE SYSTEM IS LOCKED DOWN YOU HAVE TO BE PARKED IN ORDER TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM EVEN WITH A PASSENGER IN THE CAR UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY SAVED THE ADDRESS IN YOUR CONTACTS THIS IS VERY INCONVENIENT SIMILA
VOICE RECOGNITION IS AWFUL TO THE POINT OF DISTRACTION RATHER THAN ENHANCING SAFETY IT CREATES A DISTRACTED DRIVING EXPERIENCE AS ONE TRIES TO FUMBLE THEIR WAY THROUGH IT
VOICE RECOGNITION AND EASE OF NAVIGATION
REAR SPEAKERS DON T WORK WITH BLUETOOTH MUSIC LISTENING
THE USER INTERFACE IS POOR IT ADDS CONFUSION WITH HAVING THE STANDARD RADIO CONTROLS ALONG WITH THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE CONTROLS IT S TIME TO GET RID OF THE OLD CONTROLS AND USE THE SPACE FOR A LARGER DISPLAY THAT IS TOUCH SCREEN
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS ON USING BLUETOOTH AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAVIGATION COULD BE MORE ACCURATE SYSTEM SUFFERS FROM TOO MANY LIMITATIONS WHILE CAR IS MOVING PREVENTS PASSENGER ASSIST
EASIER TO ACCESS AND MORE RELIABLE USB PORT FOR HOOKING UP AN IPOD
MANY TIMES WHEN I TRY TO DO A VOICE COMMAND A PHONE NUMBER IS DIALED IT MAY BE WHEN I M TRYING TO ENTER AND ADDRESS OR CONTROL AUDIO OF HVAC BECAUSE OF THIS I RARELY TRY TO USE THE VOICE COMMANDS SINCE IT ALWAYS TRIES TO CALL SOMEONE
THOUGH IT LOOKS NICE THE TOUCH SCREEN CAN BE DISTRACTING WHEN ADJUSTING BASS TREBLE ETC OR WHEN SELECTING A NEW AUDIO SOURCE LAST AND PROBABLY MOST IRRITATING WHY IS THERE NO DEDICATED KNOB FOR TUNING
AUTOMATIC TEXT RESPONSE FOES NOT WORK WITH IPHONE EVEN WHEN I PICK THE PREWORDED SELECTION
THE VOICE COMMANDS SHOULD BE MORE SIMPLE THE TOUCH SCREEN AUDIO MENUS COULD BE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND
WOULD BE AWESOME IF COULD HAVE A MORE FRIENDLY WAY TO PUT IN THE DESTINATION ADDRESS
DO NOT TIE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO THE UPGRADED LIGHTS AUDIO PACKAGE MOST PEOPLE TODAY USE THEIR SMART PHONES AND GOOGLE MAPS FOR UNKNOWN ROUTES WHICH GETS YOU REAL TIME DATA NOT A DISC THAT IS ALREADY OUT OF DATE WHEN YOU RECEIVE IT
ONLY ISSUE IS WITH NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT GETS TO BE A CHORE TO INPUT A DESTINATION AND TOOK A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOESN T REALLY MAKE IT MUCH FASTER AND SOMETIMES TAKES LONGER
THE VOICE COMMANDS COULD BE IMPROVED THE MOST IT DOES NOT SEEM TO RECOGNIZE MY VOICE COMMANDS AFTER NUMBEROUS TRIES SO I USUALLY GIVE UP UNLESS I AM ALONE AND HAVE THE TIME TO MESS WITH IT
THE VOICE COMMANDS DON T WORK WITH THE PHONE AND THE VEHICLE WON T PERMIT MANUAL OPERATION WHEN DRIVING
CALLERS CANNOT HEAR ME WHEN USING HANDSFREE TAKES TOO LONG TO LOAD ADDRESSES FOR NAVIGATION I JUST USE APPS ON MOBILE PHONE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS OUTMODED IT SHOULD SPEAK THE STREET NAMES COMING UP ALL THE TIME INSTEAD OF HAVING TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN TO SEE THE NAME OF IT MY PHONE WORKS BETTER THAN THIS AND IT S VERY DISAPPOINTING I WOULDN T HAVE GOTTEN THE NAVIGA
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FINE BUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS 10 YEARS BEHIND
AM TOLD PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING ME ON THE PHONE DON T KNOW IF THAT IS A PROBLEM WITH MY PHONE OR THE BLUETOOTH
THE HANDS FREE OPTION IS A JOKE A IT BARELY UNDERSTANDS MY VERY AMERICAN ACCENT MORE IMPORTANTLY EACH COMMAND REQUIRES THE USER TO PRESS THE VOICE BUTTON OFTEN MULTIPLE TIMES TO USE THE HANDS FREE NAVIGATION I NEED TO PRESS A BUTTON OVE
MAKE IT SIMPLER AND FASTER TO CONNECT YOUR MOBILE PHONE TO THE SYSTEM AND HAVE IT RECOGNIZE YOUR PHONES HAVE THE CAR AUTOMATICALLY DOWNLOAD ALL YOUR PHONE NUMBERS SO THEY CAN BE MORE EASILY AND FASTER PUT INTO THE SYSTEM
HD RADIO
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS NOT INTUITIVE AND THE HELP MENU ISN T VERY HELPFUL I AVOID USING IT BECAUSE I DON T WANT TO BE FRUSTRATED
IMPROVE SPEED FOR ENTERING ADDRESSES INTO NAVIGATION SYSTEM
MORE BASS PERHAPS IMPROVED SUB WOOFER
WHEN I AM LISTENING TO MUSIC ON MY IPHONE FOR THE MOST PART IT WORKS GREAT BUT SOMETIMES IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE THAT THE IPHONE IS CONNECTED AND WON T PLAY MUSIC I HAVE TO UNPLUG IT THEN RE CONNECT IT THEN WAIT ALSO SINCE I AM STILL GETTIN
THE SCREEN DISPLAY PRIMARILY WHEN USING THE NAVIGATION UNIT FOR MAP DISPLAY COMPARED TO OUR OTHER VEHICLE HYUNDAI GENESIS THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY IN THIS VEHICLE IS WELL BELOW STANDARD
VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS DIFFICULT TO USE
VOICE CONTROL MAKES A LOT OF MISTAKES SUCH AS CHANGING THE RADIO DIAL INSTEAD OF DIALING THE PHONE RADIO HAS NO SEPARATE TUNING CONTROL WITHOUT HAVING TO USE SCAN OR SEEK I WANT TO JUST TURN A DIAL BUT HAVEN T FOUND ANY THAT DOES WITH MANUAL
NAVIGATION COULD BE EASIER
NAV SHOULD WORK MORE LIKE GARMIN IT IS DIFFICULT TO USE MY CAR HAS THE TECH PACKAGE WITH THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM THE SOUND IS AWFUL MY LAST BMW X3 CAME WITH A HARMAN KARDON SYSTEM AND THE SOUND WAS EXCEPTIONAL THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM IN THE
CONTROLS COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY HARD TO NAVIGATE THROUGH BUTTONS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM REQUIRES TOO MANY CONFIRMATIONS AFTER A CHOICE IS MADE ALSO THE DISPLAY OF INFORMATION IS CLUTTERED
NAVIGATION COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY IF IT WORKED LIKE MY SMARTPHONE APP GOOGLE MAPS OR COULD SYNC TO THE PHONE GPS FOR EXAMPLE THE SMARTPHONE CAN FIND PLACES BASED ON A VOICE COMMAND WITHOUT HAVING TO KNOW THE ADDRESS
VOICE RECOGNITION OF PHONE USE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT TAKING THE QUICKEST ROUTE
TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS
GRAPHICS OF THE AUDIO DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I CHOSE THE MOST BASIC PACKAGE WHICH DID NOT INCLUDE THE UPGRADED ELS AUDIO SYSTEM THE STANDARD AUDIO SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM VERY POWERFUL OR IMMERSE YOU IN SURROUND SOUND LIKE OTHER AUDIO SYSTEMS ON THE MARKET SEEM TO DO I SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED U
WHEN THE CAR IS IN MOTION THE PASSENGER CAN NOT USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YOU CAN T ASK THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO LOCATE THE CLOSEST RESTAURANT BY TYPE THE SCREEN TURNS TO A DARK BACKGROUND WITH WHITE LINES AT NIGHT WHICH IS HARD TO READ THE NAV
HAVEN T USED ALL THE CONTROLS AUDIO CONTROLS FROM THE TOUCHSCREEN RADIO SAT TUNING ARE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME TO USE WHILE DRIVING
I AM STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND OTHER FEATURES SO FAR EVERYTHING HAS BEEN WORKING AND I AM HAPPY WITH TEM
NO WEATHER UPDATES LIKE NEW TOYOTA MODELS NAVIGATION GRAPHICS ARE SOMEWHAT OLD IN APPEARANCE TAKES A WHILE FOR PHONE TO CONNECT AFTER VEHICLE IS STARTED
I WISH THE VOICE RECOGNITION WORKED BETTER
THE TRAFFIC INFO SERVICE IS POOR AND NOT VERY GOOD OPERATIONALLY IT IS USELESS TO ME THE NAVIGATION SOMETIMES GIVES RIDICULOUS ROUTES
VOICE RECOGNITION ON BOTH PHONE AND NAVIGATION A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY OF INPUTING ADDRESS WHEN MANUAL INPUT IS REQUIRED PICKING LETTERS WITH THE WHEEL IS TIRING
I NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD COMPETENCE WITH VOICE COMMANDS FOR OPTIMAL USE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE
FOR SOME REASON WHEN THE TOP IS DOWN AND WIND HITS THE MICROPHONE YOU CAN HEAR STATIC THROUGH THE SOUND SYSTEM EVEN WHEN YOU RE NOT ON THE PHONE IT REALLY DOESN T MAKE SENSE
NAV NEEDS WORK
AUDIO SYSTEM IN BASE MODEL SHOULD BE THE SAME AS IN THE UPPER MODEL WITHOUT THE NAVIGATION I THINK THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS POOR FOR A VEHICLE WITH THIS PRICE POINT
TOO MAY DIFFERENT BUTTONS TO PUSH TO TRY TO FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ON THE NAVIGATION I GAVE UP
IMPROVED QUALITY WHEN USING BLUETOOTH FOR HANDS FREE CALLS
IT IS HARD TO CHANGE THE RADIO STATION WITHOUT TAKING EYES OFF THE ROAD FOR TOO LONG I MISS THE BUTTONS TURNING THE DIAL IS NOT FOR ME LUCKILY I ONLY DRIVE 10 MILES A DAY OTHERWISE I WOULD LOOK AT OTHER CARS WHEN I AM READY FOR A TRADE IN
I LOVE THE AUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM
SUBWOOFER QUALITY
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY BASIC IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WAS TOUCH SCREEN AS I HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD IN A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE VEHICLES IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE IF NAVIGATION AND ENTERTAINMENT WERE A BIT MORE STANDARD IN AUDI OVERALL
LIKE TO HAVE RADAR WEATHER ON NAV UNIT
COULD USE A TOUCH SCREEN INSTEAD OF A DIAL
TOUCH SCREEN ENABLED AS WELL AS HAVING A DIRECT CONNECT FOR IPHONE AND IPODS
GET RID OF AUDI S PROPRIETARY ADAPTER AND PROVIDE ONLY REGULAR USB PLEASE
EASE OF FINDING POI S IN NAVIGATION EASE OF SAVING FOUND DESTINATIONS FROM THE SMARTPHONE APP TO THE SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION ON NAVIGATION VISUALS ON NAVIGATION I LIKE MY IPHONE GOOGLE NAVIGATION BETTER
IT IS A CHALLENGE TO FIND AND CONNECT A PASSENGER S SMARTPHONE THE SCREEN FOR DOING SO IS BURIED WITHIN THE MENU AND WE CAN NEVER REMEMBER WHERE IT IS
NAVIGATION IS HARD TO USE YOU MUST KNOW ADDRESS SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO USE TO FIND POINTS OF INTEREST LIKE AN AIRPORT
ENTERING ADDRESSES VIA VOICE INPUT OR CHARACTER INPUT IS DIFFICULT CUMBERSOME AND VERY FRUSTRATING
TOUCH SCREEN SELECTION JUST ISN T ACCURATE WHEN DRIVING BOUNCING USUALLY MAKES THE TOUCHED BAR COME OUT TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WANTED THEN IT S HARD TO UNDO THE ERROR
I WILL PROBABLY RATE THE VEHICLE S NAVIGATION AND AUDIO FEATURES AUTOMATIC AND VOICE CONTROLS HIGHER WHEN I HAVE LEARNED HOW TO USE THEM MORE EFFECTIVELY THEIR USE IS NOT INTUITIVE FOR ME I WILL BE WORKING AT MASTERING THE NAV SYSTEM CLIMATE
IT NEEDS MORE CONNECTIVITY WITH OTHER BRANDS LIKE SAMSUNG NOT JUST APPLE
I LOVE THE BLUETOOTH USING THE SMARTPHONE I LIKE THAT I CAN SKIP OR GO BACK TO A SONG HAVEN T TRIED PANDORA YET IT TOOK AWHILE TO LEARN THE CONTROLS SOMETIMES I STILL DO BUT I NEVER USE THE STEERING WHEEL I FIND IT TOO CONFUSING I M NOT ON
LESS CLUTTER ON MENU MORE RELIABLE VOICE RECOGNITION
I WOULD LIKE THE PASSENGER TO ABLE TO CHANGE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING I WOULD BE DRIVING & MY WIFE FINDS A PLACE TO EAT ON HER PHONE & SHE CAN NOT PLACE THE ADDRESS INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITHOUT PULLING OFF THE FREEWAY
ITS FINE I DONT HAVE NAVIGATION
DON T LIKE THE SET UP OF THE SYSTEM NOB CAN BE DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING DON T LIKE THAT I HAVE TO HIT PARTICULAR BUTTONS TO USE NAV TELEPHONE RADIO ETC
I CAN ONLY REVIEW THE AUDIO ASPECT OF THE CAR THE LOCATION OF THE USB IS LACKING THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS IS PRETTY DECENT PANDORA OR OTHER MUSIC SITES SEEM TO HAVE SOME STATIC WHILE CHANGING SONGS USING AN IPOD OR PHONE THE SONGS O
I GOT 3 MONTH AUDI CONNECT SERVICE FOR FREE LIKELY WILL DEACTIVATE THIS AS I USE MY BROUGHT IN SMARTPHONE VIA BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE & NAVIGATION ETC
USB CONNECTION S ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN SD CARDS I WOULD USE USB TO PLUG MY IPHONE INTO THE AUDIO SYSTEM AS I DO IN MY OTHER CAR A JEEP
WASTE OF TIME MONEY PROVIDING I POD PLUG WILL NOT ADAPT TO NEW IPHONE SHOULD GIVE CUSTOMER OPTION WHICH TO DELIVER WITH CAR WHOLE MMI SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AT DELIVERY MORE TIME SHOULD BE DEVOTED TO EXPERIENCE
SYNCING TO AN IPHONE TAKES A VERY LONG TIME WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE SONG TRACKS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR AND TRYING TO INPUT ADDRESS USING THE KNOB IS REALY HARD AND IT TAKES A WIDE LEARNING CURVE
BLUETOOTH STREAMING SHOULD BE A STANDARD
INPUTTING ADDRESSES INTO THE NAV SHOULD BE EASIER TO DO
SYSTEMS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE PART OF SAME DESIGN INTERFACE FAMILY EACH WORKS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY CONTROLS FOR NAVIGATION NOT INTUITIVE AND CONFUSING
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE CAR WAS NOT UPDATED WITH THE IPHONE 5 EXTERNAL MEDIA DEVICE AND I DID NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF PLAYING MY IPHONE MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH SINCE I DO NOT HAVE NAVIGATION COMPARED TO OTHER PREVIOUS CARS WHICH ALLOWED ME TO DO
WORST USER INTERFACE I VE ENCOUNTERED MOST FUNCTIONS REQUIRE MULTIPLE STEPS JUST CHANGING A RADIO STATION REQUIRES TURNING A KNOW AND PRESSING A BUTTON VERY POOR DESIGN I WOULD HAVE SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT BUYING AN AUDI AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE
DISAPPOINTED IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM ALL OTHER SYSTEMS ARE QUITE NOTEWORTHY FOR QUALITY
TOUCH SCREEN FOR THE CONTROLS WOULD BE MUCH NICER ALSO EASE OF SWITCHING TO OTHER MEDIA SOURCES CAN USE SOME STREAMLINING
I WISH THAT EVEN W O THE NAV PACKAGE I HAD BETTER SCREEN INFO FOR RADIO DISPLAY IE ARTIST SONG LENGTH OF TIME LEFT OF SONG WHEN USING MY IPOD
ENABLE VOICE CONTROL BY DEFAULT
WISH IT PROMPTED TO HELP YOU LEARN THE VOICE CONTROLS WHAT CAN I HELP YOU WITH PHONE CALL DIRECTIONS RADIO AND MAYBE IT WE WOULD LEARN EACH OTHER OVER TIME
WANT VOICE RECOGNITION WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN A CONVERTIBLE A5
USE OF A TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM
SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER
INCLUDE VOICE ACTIVATED TEXT AND AND ENABLE TO READ TEXT MASSAGES
AT TIMES THE BLUETOOTH IS PROBLEMATIC
NAVIGATIONAL A BIT DIFFICULT TO OPERATE BUT IPHONE DOES NOT EASILY SWITCH WHEN ENTER CAR AND VOICE COMMANDS DON T RECOGNIZE COMMANDS OFTEN
VOICE COMMANDS ARE TERRIBLE
THE VOICE CONTROL INTERFACE IS WORSE THAN THAT IN MY ACURA IT UNDERSTANDS LESS AND IS LESS VERSATILE THE SPEAKERS ARE JUST OK NOTHING SPECIAL
WOULD PREFER TOUCHSCREEN APPLICATION FOR NAVIGATION
FOR A CAR IN THIS PRICE RANGE IT SHOULD COME WITH A REAR CAMERA I DON T HAVE THE NAVIGATION PACKAGE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON MY PHONE TENDS TO PROVIDE BETTER AND MORE ACCURATE DIRECTIONS THAN THE NAV SYSTEM IN MY CAR I VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR GETTING ME WHERE I NEED TO GO SO HAD TO PULL OVER TO ENTER A DESTINATION INTO MY PHONE
AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION STILL NEEDS SOME WORK EVEN THOUGH THE SALESMAN WENT THROUGH THE VOICE LEARNING TOOL WITH ME IT STILL DOES NOT PICK UP WELL
IT REALLY IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE OPERATE A TOUCH SCREEN WITH BETTER INPUT METHODS WOULD BE HIGHLY ENCOURAGED AND FRANKLY AS A PREMIUM BRAND ITS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING ON THE CONNECTIVITY OPTIONS IT OFFERS THE ONE THING THAT SAVES IT IS TH

MODERN CARS HAVE SO MUCH TECHNOLOGY IT JUST SEEMS SO COMPLICATED THERE HAS BEEN A LEARNING CURVE AND I HAVE NOT EVEN TRIED TO CONNECT IPOD YET AT FIRST I JUST WANTED TO GET USED TO IT AS A CAR AND WORRY ABOUT ALL THE TECHNOLOGY FEATURES LATE
VOICE COMMANDS AND PROGRAMMING THE AUDIO PRESET STATIONS
BETTER MORE ACCURATE VOICE RECOGNITION
THE SOUND COULD BE LOUDER AND MORE CLEARER LSO NAVAGATION IS AGGRAVATING BECSUSE OF THE DIAL IT JUST TAKES A LONG TIME
BLUETOOTH MICROPHONE BLUETOOTH AUDIO SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL MODELS SHOULD BE A USB PORT AVAILABLE ON ALL MODELS NOT JUST THE UPGRADED MODELS
BLUETOOTH IS BELOW AVERAGE HORRIBLE QUALITY OF SOUND

I CAN NOT USE PANDORA
THE MAP INTERFACE NEEDS TO BE MORE SIMPLE AND EASY ON THE EYES THERE IS JUST TOO MUCH INFO AT A TIME DIFFICULT TO READ WHEN IN A HURRY
I DON T LIKE HAVING TO GLANCE OVER TO THE SCREEN TO SEE WHICH NUMBER OF THE CHOICE TO TELL THE VOICE ACTIVATED OPERATOR PERHAPS I WILL GET BETTER AT IT
BLUETOOTH I HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE TRYING TO ESTABLISH A CONNECTION WHEN THE THE BLUETOOTH ASKS FOR A CONTACT THE BLUETOOTH CAN NEVER CONNECT ALWAYS SAYS IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND SPEAK SLOWLY SPEAK LOUDER DON T SPEAK TO LOUD AND IT NEVER WORKS
WHEN I SWITCH FROM BLUETOOTH TO FM RADIO I HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK A SCREEN TO GET TO FM RADIO AM IS THE FIRST TO POP UP IT IS A SMALL DETAIL BUT WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT IF FM WAS THE FIRST TO POP UP
ORANGE IS NOT MY FAVORITE COLOR SCHEME FOR ANYTHING I DISLIKE THE ORANGE DASH DISPLAY AND RADIO DISPLAY
TOO MANY TOYS LETS MAKE IT SIMPLE AND EASIER TO USE TAKE A LOOK AT GOOGLE MAPS SIMPLE WORKS GREAT 835 WATTS THEN IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE MY EARS BLEED AT HIGH LEVELS I INVESTED $3500 ITS JUST AN OK SYSTEM FOR THAT PRICE POINT UPGRA

VOICE RECOGNITION AND SPECIFICALLY THE COMMANDS RECOGNIZED BLUETOOTH SEEMS GOOD BUT NAV IS POOR
I WISH THE DVD PLAYER SCREEN WOULD HAVE A BUTTON IN THE FRONT TO LOWER AND CLOSE THE SCREENS ITS HARD TO REACH THE THIRD ROW SCREEN FROM FRONT
EASE OF USE COULD BE IMPROVED COMPLICATED BY MULTIPLE MENU SELECTIONS TO NAVIGATE
NOT VERY EASY TO NAVIGATE THRU DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OR USE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS AT ONE TIME
THE ONSTAR MODULE FAILURE IS UTTERLY RIDICULOUS
MULTIPLE CONTROLS MAKE USING THE TOUCH SCREEN AND BUTTONS DIFFICULT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS THE OWNER S MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS ARE ESPECIALLY HARD TO FOLLOW
IT IS HARD TO GO TO A PRE PROGRAMMED RADIO STATION WITHOUT TAKING YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING MORE THAN I LIKE IT FEELS UNSAFE TO DO WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION
I DO NOT LIKE THAT I CAN T CHANGE ANYTHING WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING I SWITCHED FROM AN ACURA MDX TO THE YUKON AND THAT HAS BEEN THE ONE THING I MISS FROM THE MDX

WHEN I PURCHASED THE NAVIGATION WITH REAL TIME TRAFFIC I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD WORK LIKE THE WAZE APP WHERE YOU PUT IN AN ADDRESS AND IT DIRECTS YOU TO YOUR DESTINATION TAKING CURRENT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS INTO CONSIDERATION I WAS REALLY DISAPPOIN
THE MIC IN PHONE CALLS IS REALLY AWFUL AND THE FACT THAT HONDA IS MARRIED WITH APPLE EVEN THEY ARE NEAR A 10% OF THE MARKET AGAINST ANDROID S 80% MAKE IT RIDICULOUS TO CONTINUE INSISTING ON ONLY APPLE DEVICES CAN CONNECT TO USB
TO COMPLICATED IT S MUCH EASIER TO USE AN IPHONE

THE HONDA APP IS JUST TERRIBLE IT ABSOLUTELY SERVES NO PURPOSE AND DOESN T RUN WELL AT ALL
CONNECTING TO MY IPHONE IS OFTEN DIFFICULT
USING MORE THAN ONE IPHONE FOR THE NAVIGATION APP TO WORK WITH THE MDI CORD
SHOULD MAKE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM A STANDARD ON ALL HONDA ACCORD SPORT
THE COMMAND TO SHUFFLE SONGS ON THE CONNECTED IPOD IS OFTEN IGNORED AND REQUIRES 2 OR 3 ATTEMPTS BEFORE IT IS HEEDED
IT TAKES A LOT OF MY ATTENTION FROM THE ROAD TO ADJUST THE AUDIO SYSTEM THE VOLUME CONTROL IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC A VOLUME DIAL IS SO MUCH EASIER
MORE INTEGRATION WITH ANDROID OS PHONES

I LOVE THE IDEA OF USING PHONE BLUETOOTH THROUGH MY CAR AND USING THE CAR SPEAKERS & MICROPHONE TO TALK HOWEVER I USUALLY HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING OTHERS AND HAVING THEM UNDERSTAND ME WHEN USING THESE FEATURES THAT WAS A BIG DISAP
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS HARD TO READ WHEN IT IS SUNNY OUTSIDE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SORT OF VISOR OR SOMETHING TO HELP SHADE THE SCREEN TO MAKE IT EASIER TO READ
BETTER SOUND QUALITY NEEDED

THE NAV ITS OLD TECHNOLOGY WELL IT SEEMS OLD SO I DONT USE IT GIVEN AMOUNT OF WORK IT TAKES
IT COULD EITHER HAVE A CD PLAYER OR HARD DRIVE FOR RECORDING
THE SOUND OF CALLER S VOICE ON THE BLUETOOTH PHONE WAS DISTANT AND ECHOED I HAVEN T USED IT MUCH AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE AREA I WAS IN BUT I THOUGHT THE VOICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR
MORE THOROUGH CONNECTIVITY WITH IPHONE NEEDED A SOFTWARE UPGRADE FOR THE TRUCK AS SOON AS I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP
NOT INTUITIVE VOICE COMMANDS ARE POINTLESS FOR NAVIGATION OR POINT OF INTEREST I HAVE GIVEN UP ON TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THE SYSTEM
IPOD INTEGRATION IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE
WAS UNAWARE AUDIO DID NOT COME WITH A CD PLAYER I M OLD SCHOOL AND DON T HAVE MEDIA PLAY DEVICE
CAN ONLY USE THE NAVIGATION WITH VOICE MODE UNLESS YOU PULL OVER A VERY ANNOYING UNECASSARY SAFETY FEATURE
THE VOICE PROMPTS OF THE SYSTEM COULD BE FASTER AND THE USER SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISABLE THE REPETITIVE PROMPTS E G COMMAND PLEASE
IMPROVE THE EASE WITH WHICH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CAN BE USED MY GARMAN IS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY OVERLAYING THE WEATHER INFO ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CUMBERSOM AND OFTEN INCORRECT
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION CONTROL
SYSTEM RESPONDS SLOW TO SOME COMMANDS AND TOUCHSCREEN IS VERY SLOW
RESOLVE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY ISSUES ALSO MANY OF THE FEATURES LIKE TRAFFIC AND WEATHER WERE DISABLED WHEN THE XM RADIO TRIAL EXPIRED
THE NAV SYSTEM IS GROSSLY INFERIOR IT HAS THE FEEL OF TECHNOLOGY AND IS POOR COMPARED TO A 5 YEAR OLD LINCOLN WE OWN THE LINCOLN HAS SLIGHTLY MORE USER FRIENDLY VOICE COMMANDS MICROSOFT SYNC THESE SEEM TO BE CHEAP IMITATIONS OF THE REAL
MY PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN WITH CONNECTIVITY VIA BLUETOOTH SPECIFICALLY WHEN TWO PEOPLE ARE IN THE CAR MY WIFE AND I BOTH HAVE OUR PHONES CONNECTED TO THE CAR YET WHEN I ATTEMPT TO STREAM YOUTUBE OR PANDORA TO THE BLUETOOTH SOURCE THE CAR AUTOMATIC
WE WERE SHOWN HOW TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND OTHER COMPONENTS AND I HAVE TO SAY SO FAR SO GOOD
I HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION NAVIGATION TAKES TOO LONG TO ENTER INFO SO I USUALLY DON T ATTEMPT MAKE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY WOULD BE MY WISH
IT AT TIMES IT TAKES YOU OUT OF THE WAY OF YOUR DESTINATION SHOULD BE DESIGNED TO TAKE YOU THE QUICKEST WAY I HAVE NOT NOTICED IF IT TELLS YOU THERE IS TRAFFIC OR AN ACCIDENT AHEAD AND RE ROUTES YOU THAT WOULD BE A GREAT FEATURE TO HAVE
BETTER NAVIGATION EASIER TO USE
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED OFTEN MISUNDERSTANDS WHAT IS SAID
RADIO DOES NOT SOUND THAT GOOD PLUS VERY UPSET THAT THE BLUETOOTH PHONE DOES NOT WORK RIGHT
BLUETOOTH SOMETIMES DOESN T CONNECT WELL DO RADIO DOES NOT DIGITALLY SHOW INFORMATION RADIO DISPLAY LOOKS A BIT DATED
THE CAR NEVER UNDERSTANDS ANY VOICE COMMANDS
THERE ARE SOFTWARE GLITCHES WHEN COMPLETING A PHONE CALL THE PHONE SCREEN STAYS ON AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO GO THROUGH SEVERAL STEPS TO MAKE A CALL IS FRUSTRATING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
I WOULD LIKE TO PLACE A GARMIN NAVIGATION UNIT OVER THE FACTORY SYSTEM THERE SHOULD TO BE MORE OPTIONS AND PROGRAMMABLE SETTINGS WHERE IS THE TRIP COMPUTER DIGITAL DASHBOARD FOR ENGINE DIAGNOSTICS AND USE CURRENT LOCATION FOR A DESTINATION
A BETTER SPEAKER SOUND SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE LIKE BOSE
I JUST PAID ALMOST $34 000 FOR A VEHICLE DON T MAKE ME PAY EXTRA FOR SAT RADIO AND OTHER FEATURES
ADD NAVIGATION
RADIO CONTROLS SHOULD BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF STEERING WHEEL
IMPROVE THE DIGITAL DISPLAY OF THE RADIO AND IMPROVE THE SOUND QUALITY NEED BETTER SPEAKERS AND A STONGER ANTENNA SYSTEM FOR STRONGER RECEPTION ALSO THE MIC FOR THE HANDS FREE PHONE SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABOVE ALL OF THE SEATS SO THE DIAL IN PERSON
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE VOICE CONTROL OF ALL ELEMENTS
THE SPEAKER FOR PHONE CALLS IS ONLY ON THE DRIVERS SIDE ON THE ROOF SO PASSENGERS CAN T BE HEARD BY CALLERS
I CAN T I HAVE NEVER USED THE NAV SYSTEM
SETTING UP AUDIO TO PLAY FROM ANDROID PHONE APPS TO CAR SPEAKERS COULD BE A LOT BETTER
BIGGER SUB WOOFER
I WISH I COULD EASILY SAY AN ADDRESS FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE I WISH I COULD SAY NAVIGATE TO 123 ANYWHERE STREET
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED IT S VERY SCRATCHY AND THE SOUND QUALITY IS SO BAD I REFUSE TO USE IT
LIKE THE CONTROL ON THE STEERING WHEEL VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS QUITE SUB PAR COMPARED TO MANY AVAILABLE NAV SYSTEMS ON THE MARKET IT S A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING AND IT SOMEHOW NEVER GETS THE ESTIMATED TIME OF ARRIVAL ANYWHERE NEAR THE ACTUAL ARRIVAL TIME
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE IT HAS ALL THESE NICE FEATURES BUT NOT VERY USEFUL IF THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE WONT RECOGNIZE A COMMAND LIKE CALL OR LINE 1
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SEEMS ODDLY DIFFICULT TO USE I OFTEN JUST USE MY SMART PHONE FOR NAVIGATION OFTEN ADDRESSES OR POI S EASILY FOUND ON PHONE NAVI ARE NOT DISCOVERABLE ON CAR SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION CONTROLS THE ABILITY FOR THE CAR TO READ AND DELIVER TEXT MESSAGES WOULD BE NICE
YOU KNOW I THINK IT IS GREAT THE ONLY THING I WISH IT HAD AND IT MIGHT HAVE IT BUT I DON T KNOW I WISH IT COULD READ TEXT MESSAGES TO ME MY LAST NEW CAR A FORD FOCUS SES DID READ MY MESSAGES TO ME
NAV SYSTEM IS SMALL POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF COMPATIBILITY TO CAR SIZE
NO USEFUL APPS
THE AUDIO VOLUME IS TOO SOFT THE TUNE BUTTON SHOULD BE A KNOB FOR QUICK TUNING THE POI IS DIFFICULT TO USE
NAVIGATION NEEDS TO BE AS EASY AS ON MY PHONE
I WOULD PREFER KNOBS OVER THE TOUCH SCREEN I HAVE TO LOOK AWAY FROM THE ROAD TO CHANGE SETTINGS
SOMETIMES I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY BUT I DON T KNOW IF IT IS A PROBLEM WITH MY CAR MY PHONE OR THE WI FI
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS A BIT OF A JOKE
I JUST THINK THAT IT COULD BE BETTER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND THE ENTERTAINMENT DISPLAYS ARE BASIC THERE IS MUCH MORE INFORMATION THAT COULD BE DETAILED AND THE RESOLUTION COULD BE MUCH BETTER I CAN GET A PHENOMENAL PHONE FOR A FEW HUNDRED
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NON RESPONSIVE WHEN ENTERING THE ADDRESS IT APPEARS AS THOUGH YOU NEED TO ADD AN ADDRESS IN AN ILLOGICAL ORDER FOR IT TO PROCESS CORRECTLY
THE VOLUME CONTROL SEEMS TO BE CONTROLLING NAV VOICE WHEN I WANT LOUDER MUSIC WHEN IN REALITY I RARELY WANT TO CHANGE THE NAV SYSTEM VOICE VOLUME OVERALL I HAVE TO TURN VOLUME UP TO 80 90% BARS TO GET DECENT VOLUME WHICH DOESN T SEEM RIGHT
ABILITY TO REQUEST NAVIGATION ASSISTANCE WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN THE SCREEN CHANGES TO THE MODE AND THEN YOU USE THAT MODE IT DOES NOT GO BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL SETTING YOU HAVE TO USE THE ARROW BACK TO GO BACK ALSO FOR SOME REASON PLAYING ONE AM STATION THAT I LIKE IT SEEMS TH
EASE OF USE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED CONFUSING ARRAY OF VOICE TOUCH SCREEN AND BUTTONS
COORDINATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY SOME THINGS ARE VALUABLE SOME ARE NOT RANDOM USEFULNESS OF THE VOICE ACTIVATED FEATURES SOMETIMES THEY JUST DON T WORK RIGHT
EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH PAYING FOR A VERY POOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM THERE IS NO EXCUSE WITH TODAY S TECHNOLOGY THAT A BETTER NAVIGATION SYSTEM ISN T INSTALLED INTO THE INFINITIES AGAIN SOMEONE NEEDS TO CONTACT GOOGLE FOR HELP WITH VOICE COMMAND
VOICE RECOGNITION AND INTEGRATION
NAV NEEDS TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO VOICE COMMENDS
EASE IN PROGRAMMING COULD BE IMPROVED AS WELL AS NAVIGATION
HORRIBLE INTERFACE FOR THE APPS IN CONSOLE VERY LITTLE USE TO THEM NO APPLE INTEGRATION WHICH IS JUST DUMB SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT UP WITH IPHONE LIKE OTHER CARS
IT CAN BE DISTRACTING CHOOSING RADIO STATIONS WHILE DRIVING
PROGRAMMING A DESTINATION IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED DISPLAY OF LARGER AREA OF POINTS OF INTEREST ON THE SCREEN
NAVIGATION OF USB MP3 FOLDERS IS POOR NO OPTION TO PLAY PLAYLIST NO OPTION TO NAVIGATE BACK TO PREVIOUS FOLDER OR PARENT FOLDER AFTER PLAYING A SONG
TOUCH SCREEN FINGERPRINTS ARE VERY ANNOYING BUTTONS ARE BETTER
I ALREADY MENTIONED THIS ONE EARLIER BUT THE POI FUNCTION IS NOT VERY GOOD IT S CLUNKY TO USE AND RARELY RECOGNIZES OR FINDS WHAT I M LOOKING FOR END UP USING MY IPHONE INSTEAD THE INTERFACE IS VERY GOOD OVERALL BUT THERE SHOULD BE MORE IPHONE
BLUETOOTH DOES NOT ALWAYS CONNECT TO MY IPHONE 5
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED BLUETOOTH NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED ADDING INTERNET CONNECTION WOULD BE GREAT
APPS ARE A JOKE BOSS SYSTEM IS BETTER THAN G37 BUT STILL SUBPAR COMPARE TO LEXUS BMW AUDIO OR ACURA
BLUETOOTH IS NO BETTER THAN MY NAV STILL CAN T UNDERSTAND ST LOUIS
FIX THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO
THE MEDIA DISPLAY IS OUTDATED FOR ENTERTAINMENT THERE IS NO INTERFACE WITH SMARTPHONE FOR TEXT MESSAGES CANNOT SEND OR RECEIVE THE MEDIA DISPLAY WHEN CONNECTED TO SIRUSXM IS VERY ELEMENTARY NO ARTIST ART JUST STATION LOGO AND WRITTEN TEXT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE A LOT MORE USER FRIENDLY BE ABLE TO SELECT CITY AND STATE A LOT EASIER OR TYPE IN LOCATIONS MAKE SIMILAR TO MAPS ON SMART PHONES IF YOU WANT IT TO BE USED MORE FREQUENTLY I WOULD MUCH PREFER TO USE CAR S NAVIGAT
IF IT HAS NAVIGATION IN REAL TIME I DON T KNOW ABOUT IT I FIND MY PHONE NAVIGATION IS MORE USEFUL THAT THE CARS SYSTEM
EASE OF VOICE COMMANDS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE ACCURATE I USUALLY USE THE MAP ON MY PHONE TO GET A MORE DIRECT AND ACCURATE ROUTE ALSO NEEDS TO BE EASIER TO SEARCH FOR LOCATIONS BY NAME
MAP FUNCTIONS ARE NOT TREMENDOUSLY INTUITIVE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY
EASE OF MAKING VOICE CALL ON CELL PHONE
PHONE CONNECTIVITY IS NOT VERY GOOD VOICE QUALITY IS LOW
2 THINGS SORRY NO HD RADIO CAN T BELIEVE IT THE VOICE COMMAND STRUCTURE FOR TRYING TO FIND PLACES SUCK
YOUR NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T WORK WASTING
CELL PHONE CONNECTIVITY AND PHONE BOOK INTEGRATION
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT THE MOST INTUITIVE SOMETIMES IT S EASIER JUST TO USE MY SMARTPHONE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I DIFFUCULT TO PROGRAM AND FIND POINTS OF INTEREST
LOOKS VERY OUTDATED NOT TOUCH SCREEN POOR SOUND QUALITY INABILITY TO PLAY MUSIC FROM MOBILE DEVICE VIA BLUETOOTH
WISH THE TECHNOLOGY WAS A LITTLE MORE UPDATED FOR EFFICIENT USE OF PANDORA THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND GREATER SIRIUSXM FEATURES WITH EXPANDED ALERTS PAUSE AND REWIND REALLY LIKE THE MICROSOFT SYNC SYSTEM IN MY SON S FORD EDGE MUCH BETTER OVERALL
THE HEADPHONES PROVIDED STINK
THERE ARE TOO MANY STEPS TO USE YOUR VOICE TO INPUT ALL OF THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO INPUT YOUR DESTINATION ALSO 1000 IS NOT ENOUGH ENTRIES FOR THE PHONE BOOK I HAVE 1200 CONTACTS IN MY PHONE AND WHEN YOU HAVE MOBILE BUSINESS AND HOME NUMBER
VOICE RECOGNITION POOR AT TIMES
CLARITY OF HANDS FREE
IF TRYING TO MAKE A PHONE CALL BY USING THE VOICE CONNECTION IT SEEMS TO HAVE DIFICULT UNDERSTANDING CLEARLY OR MY ENGLISH MAY NOT BE CLEAR ENOUGH OR TO LOUD ITS GETTING BETTER BUT AT TIMES NOT GOOD SO THEN I PICK UP MY I PHONE AND FIND THE   AND
BLUETOOTH IS RELIABLE AND EASY TO USE AUDIO NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS A NO FREEWAYS OPTION ALSO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO REVIEW MY ROUTE STEP BY STEP BEFORE I START AND MAKE SPECIFIC CHANGES IF I WANT FINALLY THE NAVIGATION MAP FOR LA HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS IT DOES NOT SEEM TO KNOW TH
THE BOSE SPEAKERS ARE A BIT MUDDY AND THE BASS FEELS OVER BOOSTED EVEN WHEN LEVELS ARE MANUALLY LOWERED
I VE HAD 3 JAGUARS AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS ALWAYS BEEN HORRIBLE SO I GAVE UP TRYING TO USE IT
SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO TYPE IN ADDRESSES
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IMPROVED OVER MODEL BUT STILL NOT UP TO PAR WITH OTHER BRANDS
NAVIGATION WITH MORE TRAFFIC ALERTS
TOO SLOW TO RESPOND WHEN PUTTING IN AN ADDRESS IN THE GPS SYSTEM
I STILL CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON MUTE IT S VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN LISTENING TO SOMETHING ON THE STEREO TO HAVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CONTINUALLY DECREASING THE VOLUME WHEN I DON T WANT TO HEAR THE NAVIGATION VOICE ANYW
IT IS VERY INCONVENIENT TO PLUG IN MY IPOD I WOULD RATHER BE ABLE TO CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH LIKE IN MY HUSBAND S CHEVY ALSO THE VISUAL PACKAGE LOOKS DATED
ISSUE WITH IPHONE CONNECTION THRU IN CAR SPEAKER SYSTEM PEOPLE CANNOT HEAR ME SPEAK VERY WELL  VOICE BREAKS UP INTERMITTENTLY
VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY SO BAD I SOMETIMES TURN IT OFF EVEN THOUGH I WANT TO HEAR MUSIC
REDUCE THE LONG DRAWN OUT HANDS FREE PHONE VOICE PROCESS
PUT BACK THE INTERNAL HARD DRIVE
NO BLUETOOTH OR USB SUPPORT FOR STREAMING MUSIC FROM MOBILE DEVICE
WOULD BE PREFERABLE TO HAVE PANDORA SPOTIFY COMPATIBILITY OR APP
BETTER TECHNOLOGY USING USB WITHOUT HAVING TO DISCONNECT AND RECONNECT OFTEN
I ALSO OWN A TESLA AND IT HAS A NAV SYSTEM THAT PUTS ALL OTHERS TO SHAME CHECK IT OUT
THE NEW JAG DOESN T HAVE A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY FOUND IN LOWER PRICED VEHICLES FORDS SPECIFICALLY WE WERE TOLD OURS HAD INTERNET CAPABILITY THROUGH A JAG APP IT DOES NOT I CAN T LISTEN TO PANDORA OR PLUG IN MY IPAD OR IPHONE ONLY MY IPOD I
THE BOXES THAT HAVE TO BE TOUCHED TO CONTROL THE SYSTEM ARE TOO SMALL MOST OF THE TIME I INADVERDANTLY HIT THE WRONG BOX AND GET AN UNDESIRED RESULT ALSO CHANGING STATIONS OR TRYING OTHER THINGS REQUIRE EYES OFF THE ROAD TOO LONG CREATING A DANG
THIS IS A VEHICLE AND THERE IS A BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTION BUT NO BLUETOOTH AUDIO CONNECTION THE ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THIS CAR
I JUST WISH MY BLUETOOTH WOULD UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM ASKING OF IT FROM MY PHONE CONTACTS OF CERTAIN NAMES
I WISH THE IPOD CAME ON AND OFF WITH THE SOUND SYSTEM
I DO NOT LIKE THE WAY THE PHONE CONNECTS TOO DIFFICULT AND TOO LONG TO MAKE A CALL USING VOICE COMMAND I LIKED THE SET UP I HAD IN MY VOLVO
ACCESS TO USB PORT
DISPLAY SCREEN IS UNATTRACTIVE
THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE RADIO IS INFERIOR TO THE PREVIOUS Q 37 WHICH I PREVIOUSLY OWNED THE ONLY OPTION FOR BETTER SOUND QUALITY WAS TO PURCHASE UPGRADE WITH NAV SYSTEM I DID NOT WANT THE NAV ESPECIALLY ON A LEASED BASIS SO I ACCEPTE
BLUETOOTH PHONE AUDIO QUALITY IS POOR
MY UCONNECT WILL NOT WORK AT ALL
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE THEY NEED TO BE ON THE FRONT OF THE WHEEL NOT THE BACK
IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT MY JAGUAR DOES NOT HAVE VOICE CONTROL FOR CALLING ON THE PHONE OR FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM INPUT IS 20TH CENTURY MANUAL
IT WOULD BE TO HAVE THE USB BE COMPATIBLE WITH ALL TYPES OF EXTERIOR INPUT LIKE THE IPOD
THE NAVIGATION IS UNIMPRESSIVE AND DIFFICULT TO USE THE RESOLUTION OF THE VISUALS ARE NOT CLEAR IT S LOOKS A LITTLE CHEAP AND NON PREMIUM
CALLING A CONTACT IN MY PHONE REQUIRES TOO MANY VOICE COMMAND STEPS
DIFFICULT UNDERSTANDING NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UPDATED DOES NOT KNOW HIGHWAYS OR ADDITIONS TO HIGHWAYS OPENED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS REAL TIME TRAFFIC IS NOT VERY GOOD I STILL USE GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE
SYSTEMS DOES NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZE MY VOICE OR FIND LOCATIONS DOES NOT LET ME FIND A DESTINATION WHILE DRIVING
THERE IS NOT A KNOB TO EASILY SCAN SWITCH THROUGH SATELLITE CHANNELS
I WISH THE TEXTING SERVICES WERE AVAILABLE
THE VOICE COMMANDS COULD BE BETTER AT RECOGNIZING MY VOICE
HARD TO PUT IN DESTINATIONS WHEN PROGRAMING SYSTEM
NOT A HUGE DEAL BUT I WOULD STILL UTILIZE A BUILT IN CD PLAYER MULTI DISK CD WOULD BE GREAT
VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS BAD NO CONTINUITY TO ROUTE SELECTION ON AND OFF MAJOR INTERSTATES FOR NO REASON
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IMPROVEMENT IN SOUND QUALITY ALSO USING THE APPS CAN BE SOMETIME SHAKY
SOMETIMES THE BLUETOOTH WILL LAG BEHIND WHILE PLAYING MUSIC IF I SHUT OFF MY CAR AND THEN GET BACK IN IT TAKES A FEW MINUTES FOR THE CAR TO RECOGNIZE WHAT MY PHONE IS PLAYING HAPPENS FREQUENTLY
THE AUX JACK DOESN T WORK PROPERLY
I DON T LIKE THAT THE USB LOCATION IS IN THE GLOVEBOX IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO PLUG IN FROM THE DRIVER S SIDE
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE MORE ATTUNED TO PERSON SPEAKING
I DO NOT LIKE THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU ARE ON THE PHONE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM STOPS I THINK THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE SOME WAY TO CONTINUE THE DIRECTIONS OF YOUR DESTINATION
HOW ABOUT A FULL YEAR OF SATELLITE RADIO THERE HAS GOT TO BE A SIMPLER WAY TO OPERATE THE NAV SYSTEM FOR US OLD FOLKS
INTUITIVENESS OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM
MORE POWER TO THE STOCK SUBWOOFER
VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INPUT A DESTINATION ADDRESS
VOICE RECOGNITION CAPABILITY IS TERRIBLE IT HAS NEVER ONCE RECOGNIZED A COMMAND OR POI THAT I SAID INTO THE SYSTEM WHEN THE DEALER TRIED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FEATURE IT DIDN T WORK EITHER I WAS TOLD THAT OVER TIME THE SYSTEM WOULD START TO UNDERS
PLAYLISTS CANNOT BE CREATED IN INTERNAL HARD DRIVE MODE
MY PHONE IS SUPERIOR AND EASIER TO USE FOR ALL FUNCTIONS AUDIO AND NAVIGATION
HARD TO USE VOICE ACTIVATION FOR NAV SYSTEM
THERE IS NO SUB WOOFER IN THE REAR DECK MOST CARS HAVE THIS NOW DAYS EVEN A SMALL REAR DECK SUB WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE AUDIO QUALITY
USE OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT EASY FOR ME UNLIKE MY GENESIS CAR EXPERIENCE
HAVE TROUBLE SCROLLING PREVIOUS DESTINATIONS
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO SCROLL IT MOST OFTEN GOES TO WHERE I TOUCH RATHER THAN SCROLLING
A BETTER SUB WOOFER FRONT MIDDLE SPEAKER SOUNDS FLAT WITH A 900 WATT SYSTEM DRIVING 17 SPEAKERS IT SHOULD BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF IT S MEDIOCRE AT BEST
NAVIGATION IS POOR STREET INFO IS OUTDATED
IMPROVE INTEGRATION OF DEVICES QUALITY OF SOUND OF CALLS HANDS FREE TEXTING EXPERIENCE VOICE RECOGNITION OF COMMANDS ETC
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T ALLOW ME TO SPECIFY HIGHWAYS AND TOLL WAYS TAKES ME ON MUCH LONGER ROUTES ON SMALL HIGHWAYS AND THRU TOWNS CAN EXTEND ME DRIVE BY HOURS WILL TAKE ME OFF HIGHWAY TOO EARLY SOMETIMES IT WILL TAKE ME OFF EXIT RAMP AND DI
I WISH THE CAR DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY TUNE TO THE CONNECTED MEDIA DEVICE AND THAT THE MEDIA DEVICE DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY START TO PLAY SOMETIMES PEOPLE CONNECT TO A USB PORT TO CHARGE A PHONE NOTHING ELSE
SIRIUS XM TRAFFIC IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND INACCURATE AROUND NYC THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CAR JUST THE SERVICE
WHEN PAIRING AN IPOD CLASSIC 160 GB THROUGH THE USB CONNECTION USING THE APPLE SUPPLIED AND BRANDED CABLE THE IPOD REPEADEDLY CRASHES APPROXIMATELY ONCE PER DAY AND HAS TO BE REBOOTED ADDITIONALLY SONGS IN AN ALBUM ARE SORTED IN ALPHABETIC
NEED TO IMPROVE THE EASE OF FINDING ADDRESSES
UNDERSTANDING VOICE CONTROLS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR
POOR SOUND QUALITY AND DIFFICULT TO HEAR THROUGH BLUETOOTH
THE BIGGEST CHANGE THAT HYUNDAI NEEDS TO MAKE ON THIS CAR IS THE ABILITY TO USE AUDIO CONTROLS THEN SWITCH TO PHYSICALLY USING THE TOUCH SCREEN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM REQUIRES ENTERING STREET NUMBER THEN STREET NAME THEN CITY THEN STATE IF YOU COULD JUST TYPE THE ADDRESS AS ONE LINE THAT WOULD BE A BIG IMPROVEMENT
NAV SYSTEM IS NOT ACCURATE AS IT COULD BE  MISSING STREETS
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BETTER SPEAKERS SOUND QUALITY
TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY IS TOO SMALL BETTER STOCK SPEAKERS WOULD ALSO BE NICE
YOU SHOULD INCLUDE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN ALL MODELS IN 2016
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE IS ROAD NOISE WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH
SOUND QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS NOT TOO GOOD RATHER TINNY SOUNDING I AM GOING TO REPLACE IT WITH A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE HAD A BOSE SYSTEM IN MY PREVIOUS CAR AND THAT IS WHAT I AM PLANNING TO INSTALL
THE CONNECTION TIME TO CONNECT TO THE CELL PHONE IS TOO LONG WHEN LISTENING TO AUDIO FROM THE PHONE CONNECTION THEN STOPPING THE CAR AFTER COMING BACK THE AUDIO REVERTS BACK TO THE RADIO AND NOT THE LAST PLACE IT WAS GETTING AUDIO FROM THIS IS
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER ALSO THE TOUCH SCREEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIM WHEN YOU DIM OTHER GAUGES IN THE VEHICLE
I M NOT SURE IF IT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED OR NOT BUT THE POI DOESN T SEEM TO WORK I CAN BE RIGHT IN FRONT OF A GAS STATION AND IT TELLS ME THERE IS NOT GAS STATION NEAR BY ALSO UNLESS I AM DOING SOMETHING WRONG I HAVE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO DOWNLOAD 2
DEPENDING ON WHAT MEDIA IS PLAYING THE SOUND DOESN T SEEM LIKE IT CAN GO LOUD ENOUGH THE SPEAKERS WORK BEST WHILE CONNECTING TO USB IPHONE
WE HAVE NOT USED IT MUCH YET DID NOT PURCHASE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DUE TO THE COST OF THE PACKAGE IT CAME IN WOULD BE NICE IF IT COULD BE AS A MORE AFFORDABLE OPTION
I LOOSE THE ROUTE ON NAVIGATION ON SCREEN
WHEN USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND TAKING AN ALTERNATE ROUTE I THINK THE SYSTEM SHOULD ADJUST AND FIND A NEW PRACTICAL ROUTE IT CURRENTLY ASKS YES NO OR CANCEL WHEN I TAKE DIFFERENT ROUTE
I WISH I HAD A NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE CONNECTION PROCESS TO THE BLUETOOTH IS THE PROBABLY THE WORST PROBLEM AND THE VOLUME REALLY DIFFERS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF LISTENING TO MUSIC FROM FM TO PHONE
INACCURATE NAV SYSTEM THE ONLY TIME USED OTHERWISE USING ONSTAR FOR NAVIGATION W O DIFFICULTY I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO RE SYNC MY IPHONE W  BLUETOOTH IN MY VEHICLE I LOVE IT WHEN IT WORKS
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL OF THE RADIO HARD TO SWITCH CHANNELS IT S ALWAYS CHANGING THE SOURCE TO XM OR AM
RELATIVELY EASY TO USE GOOD SOUND QUALITY SOMETIMES IF I SPEAK TOO QUICKLY MY COMMANDS ARE NOT UNDERSTOOD USUALLY RESOLVED THE SECOND TIME
SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO UPGRADE THE AUDIO SYSTEM EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE BASIC PACKAGE
BLUETOOTH IS NEVER GOOD ENOUGH AS IS WITH ALL OTHER MAKES AS WELL IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO DISCERN ANY CONVERSATION WHILE USING BLUETOOTH WITH A CELL PHONE THIS GOES FOR THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CONNECTION AS WELL AS THEY ALSO HAVE A DIFFICU
STORE MANUAL EQUALIZER SETTING FOR EACH PUSH BUTTON SELECTION REGARDLESS OF BAND
NAVIGATION IS HARD TO MANIPULATE IT DOES NOT WORK LIKE WAZE WHERE IT MIGHT FIND A ROUTE THAT IS LESS TIME CONSUMING DUE TO TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
I WISH MORE DEVICES WOULD CONNECT THROUGH THE USB MY MP3 PLAYER AND CELL PHONE BOTH COULD NOT CONNECT
EASE OF DISPLAY FUNCTIONALITY AND ADDING AN EQUALIZER CONTROL
THE NOISE PRESENT DURING FM RADIO RECEPTION IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE YOU WOULD THINK AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY GM COULD SUPPLY AN FM RADIO THAT WORKS PROPERLY
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT GOOD ALSO THE NAVIGATION IS HARD TO USE SHOULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY THE TRAFFIC ALERTS HARDLY EVER COME THROUGH ONLY SOMETIMES RANDOMLY
USING TOUCH SCREEN TO SWIPE CHANNELS IS HARD TO USE
MICROPHONE PLACEMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE CLEAR INPUT FOR VOICE RECOGNITION FOR BUILT IN FEATURES OR FOR BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO A CELL PHONE
I CAN NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE THE SYSTEM READ TEXT MESSAGES
WHY DOES ON STAR AND WIFI HAVE TO BE SO EXPENSIVE
TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT USER FRIENDLY IT DOESN T RESPOND TO TOUCH ON THE FIRST SECOND THIRD TIME OR SOMETIMES NOT AT ALL NOT GOOD
WOULD LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN TO GO BLACK SHUT OFF WHEN POWER TO RADIO IS OFF WOULD LIKE TOUCH SCREEN TO BE SIMPLIFIED SEEMS DANGEROUS TO HAVE THAT MUCH INFO IN DIFFERENT PLACES VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY TOUCHY COULD BE MY VOICE THOUGH
BETER VOICE COMMAND RECOGNITION FOR THE TIMES I USE IT
FEE TO KEEP NAVIGATION AND SATELLITE RADIO IS TOO HIGH
VOICE COMMAND COULD BE A LOT BETTER DON T USE IT MUCH WE PAID A LOT OF MONEY FOR THE RADIO UPGRADE BOSE 6 SPEAKERS SYSTEM COULD HAVE USED TWICE THE WATTS MY DODGE DURANGO INFINADY RADIO IS INCREDIBLE
NAVIGATION POI SPEECH DOES WORK WELL WHILE DRIVING HAVE TO STOP TO AND USE THE KEYPAD
THERE ARE 2 NAVIGATION SETUPS IN MY NEW IMPALA ON STAR AND SIRIUS XM SIRIUS XM NAVIGATION SHOULD NEVER COME INTO PLAY WITH THIS OR ANY VEHICLE THIS COMMENT IS SPECIFIC TO THE ICON THAT COMES WITH THE DISPLAY MY OPINION IS THAT THOUGH I AM AN
FREE MINUTES FOR HANDS FREE
PUT A BOSE SYSTEM IN EVERY ONE
IT CAN CONNECT TO INTERNET THROUGH MY IPHONE WHICH IS GOOD I DO NOT NEED ANY OTHER AUDIO SOURCE ANY MORE
I DON T OWN A CELLPHONE AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TOO HARD TO UNDERSTAND SO I DON T USE EITHER EXCEPT TO FOLLOW THE ROUTE I AM DRIVING I USE THE ONSTAR PHONE AS MY CELLPHONE AND RELY ON THEM TO CONNECT ME WHEN I HAVE TIME I WILL TAKE T
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL TO CHANGE THE CHANNLES IS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE I HAVE TO PRESS IT REALLY HARD AND MULTIPLE TIMES
HAVE CONNECTIVITY OF EXTERNAL DEVICE AND BETTER LOOKS
UNABLE TO READ TEXTS WHILE DRIVING DOESN T SHOW CALLED ID WHEN I COMING CALL COMES IN
INCOMING CALLS SOMETIMES VOICE QUALITY NOT CLEAR
CHANGING PAGES TO CHANGE STATIONS
VOICE RECOGNITION SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO REPEAT SEVERAL TIMES
TOUCH SCREEN IS A LITTLE SLOW TO RESPOND
SPEAKERS ON THE STANDARD RADIO I KNOW YOU CAN GET BOSE PUT THATS AN OPTION
BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY
TOUCH CONTROLS FOR MOVING THROUGH PROGRAMMED FAVORITE STATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO USE
HEADS UP DISPLAY
DISPLAY IS TO PLAN GENERIC NO COLORINGS NO QUALITY SOUND NEEDS A RADIO WITH STYLE THAT FITS A GREAT CAR EVEN IF IT IS JUST THE LT MODEL NAVIGATION DISPLAY IS JUST AN ARROW WITH STREET NAME LOOKS NOTHING LIKE MY GARMIN CANNOT INPUT MY OWN A
TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY USER UNFRIENDLY BRING BACK THE OLD SYSTEM
ROUTING THAT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM GIVES YOU IS NOT ALWAYS THE SAME ROUTE
TALKING ON THE BLUETOOTH IS NOT AS CLEAR AS FORD SYNC AND THE CONTROLS HAVE AN ANNOYING DELAY WHEN PRESSED
RADIO STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS SHOULD BE DEDICATED AND NOT RELIED ON TO ACCESS OTHER DATA
A NAVAGATION SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT NEED ON STAR
I HAVE NOT USED THE NAV SYSTEM TO ACTUALLY HELP ME GET SOMEWHERE I RATED IT AVERAGE BECAUSE I HAVE NOT REALLY USED IT THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED
SOUND IS POOR I HAVE A MAXIMA THAT IS MUCH BETTER 6 YEARS NEW AND IT IS NOT GOOD NAVIGATION HAS NO TERM MILE BALANCE OPTION JUST TO NEXT TURN
DO NOT LIKE THE ONSTAR ONLY NAVIGATION LINKED SYSTEM WHICH IS ONLY GUIDE BY VOICE AND TURN WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE BUILT IN MAPS AND GUIDANCE I CURRENTLY DO NOT USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THIS I TYPICALLY JUST USE MY CELL PHONE BUT WO
TOO CONFUSTING TO USE THE NAV SYSTEM SO I DON T USE IT IT IS TOO SLOW WAY TOO SLOW
THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM SEEMS IS WELL BELOW MY EXPECTATIONS
YOU CAN NOT ENTER ADDRESS INTO NAVIGATION WHILE MOVING IT REQUIRES YOU TO USE AUDIO YET IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY DIRECTIVES GIVEN BLUETOOTH DOES NOT SELECT THE CORRECT PERSON NUMBER WHEN ASKED TO CALL SOMEONE FRUSTRATING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEED TO DISPLAY ACURATE SIGNS AS SEEN ON THE HIGHWAY NOT STREET NAMES THAT ARE NOT DISPLAY AS SUCH ON THE HIGHWAY
EXPAND THEY TYPES OF PHONES COMPATIBLE WITH THE SYSTEM MY IPHONE IS COMPATIBLE BUT MY HUSBAND S PHONE IS NOT I WISH YOU COULD USE BLUETOOTH TO BE ABLE TO USE VOICE COMMANDS WITH THE IPHONE INSTEAD OF IT HAVING TO BE CONNECTED VIA USB PORT
I RALLY DO NOT KNOW ALTHOUGH IT IS EQUIPPED WITH THE ON STAR SYSTEM I DON T USE IT I DO HOWEVER MAKE USE OF THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE FOR MY CELL PHONE
NOT HAVING TO PAY ONSTAR WOULD BE GREAT TO BEGIN WITH NOT HAVING TO PAY TO KEEP WIFI AND THE SOUND SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO LIKE WHEN YOU HOOK IPHONE TO IT FOR MUSIC COMPLETELY DISTORTS THE SOUNDS SAME THING HAPPENS WHEN CONNECTING KINDLE FIRE
WHY WE HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE WHOLE NAVIGATION PROGRAM TO THE PHONE FIRST AND PAY FOR IT
HAVE BUILT IN PREMIUM SOUND AND UP TO DATE FEATURES
THE EGUALIZER SOUND CANT BE ADJUST WHEN PLAYING USB FLASH DRIVE ALL THE MUSIC SOUND THE SAME
ABILITY TO PLAY MUSIC ON GALAXY 5 AND GO TO NEXT FROM STEERING WHEEL WITHOUT PAUSING ALSO USB NEEDS TO WORK WITH GALAXY S5 FOR PLAYING MUSIC
THE TOUCHSCREEN IS A DISTRACTION WHILE DRIVING THERE IS NO TACTILE FEEDBACK WHEN MAKING A SELECTION THE SCREEN IS NICE FOR THE BACK UP CAMERA BUT I WOULD PREFER BUTTONS FOR THE AUDIO CONTROL
TOUCH SCREEN SHOULD BE ANGLED TOWARD DRIVER
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE IT REQUIRES ONSTAR OR MANUALLY SENDING AN ADDRESS FROM A COMPUTER OR OTHER ONLINE DEVICE EVEN WHEN THE NAVIGATION IS ON IT DOES NOT USE THE ENTIRE 8 SCREEN BUT RATHER SHOWS A MAP OF ABOUT 3
NON ONSTAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM GARMIN
CLEARER SOUND WHEN USING WIRELESS PHONE CONNECTIVITY AND DISPLAY GOING BACK TO LAST USED SCREEN WHEN PHONE CALL IS ENDED
THE COST OF SATELLITE WIFI ECT IF YOU WANT IT ALL IS AS BAD AS ANOTHER CAR PAYMENT
AUDIO LEVELS SHOULD GO HIGHER AND BE CLEARER ALSO THE CAR SHOULD INCLUDE BOT A USB AND CD PLAYER MY CAR DID NOT I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED
DON T SWITCH OFF BLUETOOTH AUDIO EVERY TIME I RESTART THE VEHICLE
THERE IS AN APP THAT WILL WORK WITH THE TOUCHSCREEN BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT GIVE THAT 60 SUBSCRIPTION FREE WITH IT
IT DOESN T HAVE COMMUNICATION AND NAVIGATION AND THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS BARELY THERE
REPAIR WHAT CAUSES AN INAUDIBLE MUFFLED SOUND WHILE USING THE BLUETOOTH FOR CALLS
IT S AN LS VERSION SO I DON T EXPECT MUCH SOUND QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED IN STOCK SPEAKERS
CD PLAYER SHOULD STILL BE STANDARD
IT IS A MODEL WITH NO CD PLAYER OR USB PORT ONLY ONE PLACE TO PLUG IN A CIGARETTE LIGHTER USB PORT TO CHARGE THE PHONE OR PORTABLE DVD PLAYER  TABLET HEAD PHONE JACK TO PLUG THE PHONE IN TO THE RADIO JUST TO LISTEN TO IT NO REAR SPEAKERS
I INSTALLED AN AFTERMARKET PIONEER STEREO DC PLAYER AM FM IPOD PLAYER WITH TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY
IT SHOULD HAVE A BETTER SPEAKER SYSTEM THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS PURELY PHONE BASED
WOULD BE MUCH MORE USEFUL TO HAVE A PHYSICAL VOLUME KNOB THAN TO USE TOUCH CONTROLS FOR VOLUME
HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY USING THE VOICE CONTROL TO MAKE CALLS FROM MY IPHONE MY CRUZE IS EASY TO USE BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT SYSTEM AND I CANNOT GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO OR WHETHER I AM ABLE TO USE THE HANDS FREE CALLING WITH MY CAR AND CELL PHONE WITHOUT AN ADDITIONAL SUBSCRIPTION WOULD BE HELPFUL I READ THE MANUAL AND CAN T SEEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT I CAN T SEEM TO FIG
ONLY APPLE PRODUCTS WORK WITH THE USB PORT I DON T USE APPLE PRODUCTS SO MOST FEATURE S I CANT USE
SOUND QUALITY ESPECIALLY WHEN USING BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE CALLS
PHONE SYNCING ISSUE
MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE HAD A MOUSE THAT I COULD USE TO TURN TO FAVORITE PHONE NUMBERS I DON T REALLY USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE HOW IT WORKS I FIND MYSELF TAKING MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO USE THE NAVIGATION SCREEN TO MAK
HAVE ONSTAR
WOULD LIKE INPUT JACKS FOR PERSONAL HEADPHONES TO BE USED FOR WATCHING MOVIES ON DVD PLAYER JACKS IN SECOND AND 3RD ROW FINDING ADDRESSES ON NAVIGATION IS CUMBERSOME
THE VOICE COMMAND THE EASE OF SYNCING AN IPOD TO THE SYSTEM
BLUETOOTH IS VERY RELIABLE AND SOUNDS GREAT
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE DVD SYSTEM WOULD RESTART MOVIES IN THE SAME SPOT WHEN YOU TURN OFF THE VEHICLE AND START IT AGAIN
THE NAVIGATION TAKES WAY TOO LONG TO CATCHUP AND DOESNT ALWAYS HAVE THE INFO TO YOU BEFORE YOU ARE PAST WHERE YOU NEED TO GO
BETTER CONNECTION TO IPHONE
TURN X TURN IS TERRIBLE FEATURE AND NOT PROVIDING NAVIGATION MAPS IN A $55K VEHICLE
NAV SYSTEM LACKS A SENSE OF LOCATION IN REFERENCE TO ALL ROADS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS JUST ANNOYING IT ASKS TOO MANY QUESTIONS AND THEN ULTIMATELY CAN T LOCATE THE ADDRESS
NAVIGATION DOES NOT SHOW VEHICLE SPEED AND CURRENT SPEED LIMIT AS DOES MY GARMIN
WE HAD TROUBLE WORKING THE DVD PLAYER
SEPARATE BOOKLET OF DIRECTIONS FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
EASIER TO USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I MESSED UP ANYTHING REGARDING BUILT IN NAVIGATION SHOULD NOT BE USED I WAS CONSIDERING ONSTAR AS BEING BUILT IN NAVIGATION AND DIDN T REALIZE UNTIL LATER IN THE SURVEY THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT A BUILT IN GPS SORRY
SOFT TOUCH CONTROLS ARE NOT RECOGNIZING TOUCHES AT TIMES
MORE FAVORITES AVAILABLE ON ONE PAGE
HEADS UP DISPLAY IS EASY TO READ AT A GLANCE WHILE DRIVING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MADE MORE USER FRIENDLY
IT IS NOT SAFE TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN THE AUDIO INPUTS AND DRIVE SAFELY IN TRAFFIC AS THIS REQUIRES LOOKING AWAY FROM THE ROAD SO I DO NOT USE SIRIUS OR THE BLUETOOTH
I TRULY LOVE THE INTERACTION WITH ONSTAR AND THE NAV IN THE VEHICLE MY FAVORITE PART IS THE DING BUZZ AS YOU ARE ALMOST TO THE PLACE EXIT OR POI YOU ARE TO BE TURNING OR ARRIVING
THE RECEPTION WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM ISN T DLEAR WHEN DRIVING TOO MUCH WIND NOISE FROM THE OUSTSIDE EVEN WITH THE WINDOWS SEALED TIGHT AND NO AIR CIRCULATING INSIDE THE VEHICLE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS UTTERLY USELESS IT S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND DIFFICULT TO USE AND IS NOT NEARLY AS HELPFUL AS MY OLD GARMIN GPS
NAVIGATION NEEDS VOLUME CONTROL CANT HEAR WELL IF RADIO IS ON
BETTER SPEAKERS TRAVERSE HAD BOSE SPEAKERS
NOT USER FRIENDLY TOO COMPLEX TOO MANY WAYS TO DO ONE FUNCTION CONFUSE THE ISSUE I SUGGEST TO BUILD CARS THAT KEEP THE CLIMATE CONTROLS ON TWO ROTARY SWITCHES AND ALL RADIO CONTROLS WITH BUTTONS ON THE RADIO THE OTHER ADVANCED FEATURES ITE
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO AN IPHONE IS INCONSISTENT AND A STEP BACK FROM WHAT I EXPERIENCED IN MY VOLT ALSO THE IN VEHICLE WIFI WOULD BE NICE BUT I CAN NEVER REMEMBER THE PASSWORD TO CONNECT WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO PULL THAT UP ON TH
NAV DIRECTIONS ARE WAY TOO LOUD MAY BE A WAY I CAN CHANGE VOLUME DO NOT KNOW YET
I DON T KNOW HOW TO SWITCH QUICKLY BACK TO AUX FROM SATELLITE RADIO W  GOING TO STEERING WHEEL CONTROL AND GO THROUGH MENU ON DASH DISPLAY I CAN EASILY CHANGE TO RADIO BECAUSE TABS ARE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN BUT NOT THE AUX OR USB SHOULD
EASE OF USE OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I LOVE THE RADIO BUT WISH I HAD GOTTEN CD PLAYER BELIEVE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED
EASIER TO USE UNDERSTAND USE OF WI FI HOTSPOT ALONG WITH AN ABILITY TO PLUG IN AND EMPLOY AN IPAD FOR NAVIGATION
EASE OF TOUCHSCREEN
HAVING NAVIGATION INSTEAD OF ONSTAR NAVIGATION
I PAID $500 EXTRA FOR BOSE SPEAKERS THIS IS THE WORST RADIO SOUNDING RADIO I VE HEARD IN 20 YEARS VERY DISAPPOINTED
FIX THE NAV
I HAVE COLORADO LT NOT IMPRESSED WITH AUDIO SYSTEM MY AVALANCH IS BETTER
I AM NOT A TECHNO GEEK SO 90% OF THIS HIGH TECH STUFF IS WASTED ON ME I USE A CAR FOR TRANSPORTATION NOT AS AN ENTERTAINMENT OR INFORMATION CENTER
GPS SYSTEM AND MAP
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION AND MORE COMANDS
CUMBERSOME TO STORE POI S
  CD PLAYER
GET RID OF THE TOUCH SCREEN AND USE BUTTONS EXCLUSIVELY TOUCH SCREEN IS GREAT UNTIL IT IS ALL FINGERPRINTED UP FROM REPEATED USE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM UPDATES SHOULD BE OVER THE AIR AND INCLUDED IN VEHICLE PURCHASE PRICE TESLA DOES THIS AND MORE AT THE SAME PRICE POINT
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY SLOW TO RESPOND

VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS WORK
AUDIO QUALITY FOR THE PERSON I M ON THE PHONE WITH MORE RESPONSIVE VOICE CONTROL FOR AUDIO SETTINGS
THE POSITION OF THE NAV SCREEN IS AWKWARD FOR THE PASSENGER TO TYPE ON AND TOUCH IT IS ANGLED TO THE DRIVER
VOICE RECOGNITION SYTEM THAT UNDERSTANDS BASIC ENGLISH
COMMUNICATE BETTER
SOUND QUALITY LEAVES MUCH TO BE DESIRED ESP WHEN USING SIRIUS SYSTEM LACKS POWER SPEAKER QUALITY IS POOR
VOICE RECOGNITION HARD TO USE IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING
NAVIGATION ROUTES COULD BE UPDATED
THE CAR IS ONLY ABLE TO CONNECT OR RECOGNIZE AN IPHONE IT SHOULD BE ADAPTABLE TO ANDROID DEVICES AS WELL I HAVE AN SAMSUNG DEVICE AND MY CAR DOESN T RECOGNIZE IT
I HATE THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOT AN OPTION FOR CD DVD WILL LIKELY AFFECT MY DECISION TO BUY A VEHICLE THAT HAS THESE OPTIONS AGAIN THE VOICE RECOGNITION HAS NOT WORKED WELL FIR ME
HANDS FREE CALLING VOLUME HAS TO BE ADJUSTED FROM RADIO VOLUME TO HERE CALLERS
MORE APPS FOR THE UCONNECT SYSTEM
SOMETIMES THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT CONNECT TO MY PHONE RIGHT AWAY I MAY HAVE TO RESTART THE VEHICLE TO GET A CONNECTION
ITS FRUSTRATING THAT IT WON T DO THE TEXT OPTION WITH MY IPHONE
HANDS FREE PHONE
RADIO IS OLD TECHNOLOGY BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN VEHICLE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM CAN BE IMPROVED GREATLY AND MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS AREN T THAT APPEALING
ALLOW BACK UP CAMERA TO BE ON WHEN DRIVING ALLOW FRONT PASSENGERS TO SEE VIDEO BEING PLAYED ON REAR SCREENS ALLOW OWNERS TO LOAD MULTIPLE PICTURES TO THE AUDIO HARDRIVE AND THEN SHUFFLE THE DISPLAY THROUGH THE PICTURES YOU CAN LOAD PICS NOW
I LIKED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN MY OLD VAN BETTER THAN THE NEW ONE I WAS ABLE TO FOLLOW IT EASIER THAN THIS ONE
NAVIGATION MUST BE SET UP BEFORE LEAVING FOR DESTINATION CANNOT BE DONE BY PASSENGER WHILE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION
BETTER INTEROPERABILITY WITH APPLE IOS PRODUCTS CAN T SEND TEXT MESSAGES WITH VOICE ACTIVATED CONTROLS WITH IOS HAVING A USER DEFINED DEFAULT NAVIGATION DISPLAY OR OVERALL DISPLAY I E IF I WANT MY DISPLAY TO DEFAULT TO THE NAV MAP OR THE RA

BLUETOOTH INTEGRATION
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PEOPLE WITH ACCENTS
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A USB INPUT INCLUDED WITH THE BASIC RADIO
MORE CONTROL OVER AUDIO SOUND BY ADDING A GRAPHIC EQUALIZER
NAVIGATION CAN BE OPERATED BY PASSENGER WHEN VEHICLE IS IN MOTION
EASE OF USE TO SET UP THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM SOUND USER INTERFACE ECT
FROM WHAT I HAVE USED IT HAS BEEN FINE BUT I STILL HAVE NOT UTILIZED MANY FEATURES SUCH AS CONNECTING AN IPAD PHONE OR UTILIZED THE DVD PLAYER
THE HMI COULD BE SIMPLER & CLEANER EASIER TO VIEW AT A GLANCE HAVE NEVER FIGURED OUT HOW TO ORGANIZE THE HARD DRIVE UPLOAD MUSIC INTO ALBUMS MANUALS ARE ALL BUT USELESS FOR LEARNING EASY OPERATION
UCONNECT DOES NOT WORK CALLED SEVERAL TIMES COULD NOT HELP JUNK SHOULD HAVE NEVER BOUGHT WITH VAN
THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK OF IS THE BLUETOOTH CALLS ARE NOT ALWAYS CLEAR I HAVEN T TRIED TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET SO I COULDNT REALLY RATE IT BUT ONCE I DO IM SURE IT WILL BE SOMETHING I WILL USE OFTEN
MUSIC IS NOT ALLOWED WHILE CAR IN OPERATION COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION NOT USED SO FAR
EXPANDED EQUALIZER FOR BETTER QUALITY SOUND
THE 2 DVD PLAYERS CAN BE CUMBERSOME AT TIMES SOMETIMES I CANT GET THE TOP ONE TO PALY SOUND WHEN IT IS SELECTED
WHEN MAKING AND RECEIVING PHONE CALLS BUT NOT ABLE TO RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES
I HATE THAT I CAN T LISTEN TO THE RADIO WHILE A MOVIE IS PLAYING FOR THE KIDS
THE NAV SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW FOR ALTERNATE ROUTES FOR REVIEW BEFORE SETTLING OUT FOR MY DESTINATION I HAVE THIS ABILITY ON MY APPLE DEVICES AND FIND IT VERY HELPFUL FOR USE IN THE CITY
DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ME AND WILL NOT DOWNLOAD PHONEBOOK
MY NEW VAN DOES NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH I THINK ALL VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY THIS IS THE ONLY ASPECT OF MY NEW VAN I DO NOT LIKE WE TRADED IN A MALIBU LS THAT HAD BLUETOOTH AND IT WAS A BASE MODEL CAR
STREAMING AUDIO FROM MY IPHONE BASICALLY NEVER WORKS THIS IS TRUE OVER BT OR USB AND FOR THE BUILT IN APPS RADIOPUP ETC THAT USE THE PHONE
THE APP THAT CONNECTS YOU TO THE INTERNET CONTINUALLY ASKS YOU TO SIGN UP FOR EVERY TIME WE USE ALSO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS GREAT THE ONLY THING IS ON LONG TRIPS IF YOU STOP FOR A BATHROOM BREAK IT REPEATEDLY TELLS YOU YOU ARE GOING THE WR

I DON T LIKE THAT I HAVE TO PAY TO USE INTERNET IN MY OWN CAR AND IT WOULD VE BEEN BETTER IF IT CAME A CD PLAYER
HANDS FREE NAVIGATION WHILE DRIVING
PHONE PAIRING AND RADIO DISPLAY
NO REAL IMPROVEMENT NECESSARY IT IS AN AVERAGE SETUP AND THAT IS WHAT I LIKE THE STEERING CONTROLS FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS THE REAL DIFFERENCE THAT STEPS IT UP
CONNECTING TO BLUETOOTH SHOULD BE EASIER
NAV SYSTEM LOCKS SO PASSENGER CAN NOT CONTROL WHEN MOVING WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE PASSENGER FEATURE TO ALLOW CONTROL IF PASSENGER IS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT GRAPHICS OF THE MAP SYSTEM ARE PRETTY DATED WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE CLEAN DISPLAY GRAPHICS H
PHONE CONNECTION AUDIO
FACTORY CD PLAYER WOULD BE VERY NICE ALLOWS FOR A MORE SPECIFIC PERSONAL INTERACTION WHILE DRIVING ESPECIALLY FOR INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF THAT AREN T INTO THE UPDATED ELECTRONIC AGE
THE NAVIGATION WON T ALLOW STREET NAMES TO BE ENTERED IT S TOO DIFFICULT TO USE SO I USE MY CELL PHONE INSTEAD
WISH CAR HAD A CD PLAYER HALF OF THE TIME THE VOICE SYSTEM CAN NOT UNDERSTAND YOU
STILL WORKING ON FIGURING IT ALL OUT DIDN T EVEN REALIZE I DIDN T HAVE A CD PLAYER WHEN I BOUGHT IT MUSIC QUALITY IS GOOD HARD TO GET ADDRESS INTO NAVIGATION SYSTEM CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL COULD BE IMPROVED UPON TOO MUCH GOING ON ON THE
THE SCREEN IS SMALL I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE OFFERED BIGGER SCREENS ON DIFFERENT MODELS BUT WHEN PAYING $30 000 FOR A CAR I WOULD EXPECT TO HAVE ATLEAST A BIGGER SCREEN AS WELL AS SATELLITE RADIO AS AN OPTION
I WOULD LIKE BETTER GRAPHICS ON THE MAP
VOICE RECOGNITION WITH NAVIGATION
THE MODEL WOULD ALERT ME TO UPCOMING TRAFFIC ON THE ROAD I AM TRAVELING AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH AN AUDIBLE VOICE OVER THE SPEAKERS THE MODEL DOES NOT DO THAT ALSO THE NAVIGATION VOICE PROMPTS DON T TRULY INTERRUPT THE VEHICLE S AUDIO A
RADIO CONTROLS FROM STEERING WHEEL
THE NAVIGATION FOR SOME REASON IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE CERTAIN ADDRESSES THAT MY GOOGLE MAPS CAN
THE SPEAKERS ARE LACKLUSTER FOR THEIR ADVERTISEMENT AS ALL BEATS BRAND SPEAKERS ARE I HAD A BETTER AUDIO RESPONSE CURVE AND BETTER BASE IN MY OLD CAR S FACTORY 500W STEREO SYSTEM THAN DODGE S 558W BEATS SYSTEM
EASE OF ENTERING DESTINATION INTO THE NAVIGATION
IN A TECH PACKAGE EQUIPPED CAR THE 6 SPEAKER SOUND SEEMS LOWER END NO SUBWOOFER
INPUTTING WHERE YOU ARE GOING ON THE NAVIGATION IS QUITE A SLOW PROCESS
EASIER TO CHANGE XM CHANNEL WHILE DRIVING
BETTER IPHONE COMPATIBILITY NEEDS TO ACCESS PLAYLISTS AND LIBRARY ON ITUNES
I DON T KNOW HOW TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND DEVICE AT THIS TIME
DOES NOT COME WITH A USB PORT ALL CARS NOW SHOULD COME WITH A USB PORT
SOMETIMES THE TOUCH SCREEN IS HARD TO CHANGE OR ACTIVATE WHEN TOUCHING
TO HAVE SIRIUS XM RADIO IN ALL VEHICLES
ADD A USB PORT
THE CAR IS LOUD SO THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T PICK UP
BETTER SOUND QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE VEHICLE
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
VOICE RECOGNITION IS SPOTTY SOMETIMES BUT I DON T USE IT OFTEN SO THAT MAY BE THE ISSUE
IT S SLOW NAV POINTS OF INTEREST ARE LACKING BLUETOOTH CAN T HANDLE MULTIPLE PHONES TEXT FEATURES DON T WORK WITH APPLE DEVICES
ALLOW NAVIGATION USE WHILE VEHICLE IS MOVING THERE ARE PASSENGERS WHO CAN USE IT SOME TIMES TEXT TO SPEECH GETS ANNOYING ON MULTIPLE TEXTS
CHEAPER BUILT IN WIFI
READS TEXT IMMEDIATELY SHPULD ASK IF YOU WANT TO
READ AND COMPOSING TEXTS WOULD BE VERY USEFUL IF MY PHONE IS CONNECTED TO BLUETOOTH THE SOUND OF THE RINGER AND TEXT TONE DOES NOT WORK
CD PLAYER I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IT DID NOT HAVE ONE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS HORRENDOUS I HAVE YET TO GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY
HAVE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL TO CHANGE RADIO STATION SO ONE DOES NOT HAVE TO TAKE THEIR EYES OFF THE ROAD TO LOOK AT DISPLAY SCREEN TO CHANGE STATION
I WISH I HAD INTERNET CONNECTION IN MY CAR WITHOUT PAYING FOR SIRUS I AM SUPPOSED TO HAVE IT FREE TILL AUGUST BUT I CAN NOT GET IT TO WORK
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR READING PHONEBOOK CAN BE HIT OR MISS
WISH IT HAD A CD PLAYER AND WOULD CONNECT WITH MY LARGER MP3 PLAYER
THE VOICE RECOGNITION ISN T WORKING AS WELL AS MY PREVIOUSE VEHICLE AND I FREQUENTLY HAVE TO DIAL MY OWN CALLS
OCCASIONALLY DOES NOT UNDERSTAND COMMANDS USUALLY WHEN MOVING VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED
MORE CUSTOMIZATION OF SONGS PLAYED THRU USB DEVICE
VOICE RECOGNITION IS DIFFICULT TO LEARN
LAYOUT OF AUDIO SYSTEM BUTTONS COULD BE IMPROVED
BEYOND THE PROBLEMS WITH VOICE RECOGNITION ON PHONE USE THE DISPLAYS AND CONTROLS FOR THE AUDIO OPTIONS ARE CONFUSING AND NON INTUITIVE
EASIER TO GET BACK TO FAVORITES
EASE OF USE IN FINDING AND SETTING NAVIGATION DESTINATION THE SEARCH IS FAR WORSE THAN 10 YEAR OLD FORD ESCAPE SHOULD ALLOW EASIER SEARCH FOR POI HARDLY EVER FINDS THEM ENTRY OF DESTINATION ADDRESS WITHOUT ENTERING CITY FIRST  SENDING A
HORRIBLE USB PORT PLACEMENT
IN ORDER TO USE THE GPS SYSTEM AND VISUALIZE IT IN THE SCREEN YOU HAVE TO BE HOOKED UP TO BRINGGO I DON T LIKE BRINGO I AM NOT ABLE TO USE THE UPS PORT WITH MY IPHONE TO SEE NAVIGATION WITH WAZEOR GOOGLE MAP IS THERE ANOTHER WAY WITHOUT BUSIN
I WAS NOT AWARE THAT MY AUDIO SYSTEM DID NOT HAVE A CD PLAYER THE FIRST MODEL I SAW HAD ONE AND I THOUGHT THAT MY VEHICLE WOULD HAVE ONE BUT IT DOESN T I AM IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING AN IPOD SO I COULD LISTEN TO THE MUSIC I ENJOY THE ENTERTAI
I AM UPSET THERE IS NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT I LOVE THE CONTROLS ON THE WHEEL
NO CD IT IS LIKE IT IS 1976 AND THE WANT OF A TAPE DECK I DO NOT LIKE ADDING AFTERMARKET THINGS TO MY VEHICLES AND I FEEL THIS IS A MAJOR FLAW
BETTER SENSITIVE MICROPHONE FOR HANDS FREE DEVICE DUE TO PEOPLE SAYING THEY HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING ME
WHEN ON A TELEPHONE CALL THROUGH BLUETOOTH MY VOLUME IS SET TO 45 HOWEVER WHEN LISTENING TO AUDIO THROUGH THE RADIO IT IS SET TO 115 THE AUDIO VOLUME RANGES FOR BOTH APPLICATIONS SEEM TO BE SET DIFFERENTLY
ONSTAR SHOULD NOT BE LOCATED ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TOO EASY TO HIT BY ACCIDENT WHEN ADJUSTING MIRROR
LOCATION OF THE AUDIO AND USB PORTS
PEOPLE FIND IT DIFFICULT TO HEAR ME THRU THE BLUETOOTH
I DO NOT LIKE THE BRINGGO NAVIGATION SYSTEM ACCESSED THROUGH MY PHONE AND ONSTAR IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER INBOARD NAVIGATION OPTION
BRING BACK DIALS TOO HARD TO CHANGE STATIONS WHEN YOU RE DRIVING E G TRY TO GET FROM XM STATION 8 TO XM STATION 9 AND IT WILL GIVE YOU A MESSAGE TO READ WHILE YOU RE TRYING TO DRIVE AND YOU HAVE TO HIT OK AND MAYBE YOU WILL GET STATION 9 IT
I WOULD LIKE A CD PLAYER
CAN T PLAY MY COLLECTION OF TAPED CD S PLAYER NOT INCLUDED IN MY TRAX
WHEN USING HANDS FREE CALLING VOICE IS CLEARER AND PERSON ON OTHER END CAN ACTUALLY HEAR BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE
WHEN I PLUG INTO THE AUX PORT MY IPHONE MUSIC DOESN T ALWAYS CONNECT CORRECTLY CONNECTING WITH THE APPLE CORD WORKS BETTER BUT HAS TROUBLE PROCESSING WITH MY IPOD THAT HAS THOUSANDS OF SONGS
I CANNOT ALWAYS GET THE VOICE COMMAND TO MAKE MY PHONE CALL BY USING THE FUNCTION ON STEERING WHEEL I PRESS ON IT AND GET THE VOICE COMMAND AND TELL IT WHO TO CALL AND IT REPEATS THAT BUT THEN THE CALL DOES NOT GO THROUGH VERY FRUSTRATING ALSO
I NEED TO TOGGLE THRU THE SOURCES WHEN USING THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS AND WHENEVER IT TOGGLES THRU THE BLUETOOTH IT AUTOMATICALLY STARTS PLAYING MUSIC FROM MY IPHONE IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY START PLAYING BECAUSE THEN IT P
ROLLING THE THUMBWHEEL ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO CHANGE RADIO STATIONS AND CD TRACKS IS RIDICULOUSLY HARD AND DANGEROUS WHILE DRIVING AS MUCH AS THIS CAR COSTS THIS SHOULD BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY
THE VOLT DOES WHAT I DEMAND OF IT I NEVER TEXT NOR USE THE IPHONE WHILE DRIVING ON LONGER TRIPS MY WIFE WILL PROBABLY USE THE CELL PHONE AND CONNECT TO CELL SERVICES USING THE IPAD
I HAVE NOT GIVEN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ENOUGH TIME TO BE FAMILIAR WITH MY CELL PHONE IS MORE COMFORTABLE AND FAMILIAR
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO INPUT A DESTINATION ADDRESS EITHER TOUCH SCREEN OR VOICE NEED TO HAVE MORE NATURAL COMMANDS AS MEMORIZING THE LIMITED BUILT IN COMMAND SEQUENCE IS FRUSTRATING
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED SOMEWHAT PHONE AUDIO COMES IN VERY LOUD COMPARED TO OTHER SOURCES
I WISH THERE WAS A CD PLAYER AND A NAVIGATION SYSTEM
DO NOT USE ENTERTAINMENT OR NAVIGATION
TOUCHSCREEN IS ALWAYS DIRTY
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL TO ACTIVATE CALLS
HAVING IT BUILT IN INSTEAD OF HAVING ONSTAR
I WISH IT HAD A CD PLAYER AS WELL
I WISH IT HAD A CD PLAYER BUT THAT S NOT A PRIORITY AT THE CURRENT TIME
NOT A FAN OF TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS DIFFUCULT TO CHANGE WHILE DRIVING WITHOUT TAKING YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD
MORE VOICE CONTROL A LOT MORE I CAN CONTROL MY XBOX MORE THAN I CAN THE SYSTEM IN THE TRAX
HAVE TO YELL TO BE HEARD OVER HANDS FREE PHONE
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I MISS MY CD PLAYER
COULD HAVE A CD PLAYER IN THIS MODEL
THE DIRECTIONS IN THE MANUAL DIDN T CORRESPOND TO HOW WE NEED TO SET UP DIFFERENT ASPECTS SUCH AS THE PHONE ALSO SETTING FAVORITE STATIONS AND FINDING OTHER STATIONS ON THE ROAD IS NOT EASY WE DON T KNOW IF WE HAVE THE SATELLITE RADIO OR NAV
THE VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE A CD PLAYER
DOWNLOADABLE APPS
NEED CD PLAYER
SOUND QUALITY ON CALLS COULD BE CLEARER
I MISS HAVING A CD PLAYER
HAVING A CD PLAYER AS WELL
BOSE STEREO SYSTEM HAS INCREDIBLE SOUND QUALITY
THE VEHICLE COULD COME EQUIPPED WITH A CD PLAYER AND  OR SATELLITE RADIO
I NEED A CD PLAYER WHICH MY VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE A PERSON SHOULD NOT BE USING APPS OR FACEBOOK WHEN DRIVING I DO LIKE TO LISTEN TO AUDIO BOOKS AND NOW HAVE TO USE AN EXTERNAL PORTABLE CD PLAYER WHILE DRIVING WHICH IS NOT SAFE OR ATTRACTIVE I
THE SOUND QUALITY WITH PHONE CALLS COULD BE BETTER
PHONE CALLS OVER SPEAKERS CAN BE A LITTLE MORE CLEAR
NO TAPE OR CD
I WISH THE FACTORY INSTALLED AUDIO SYSTEM WAS A LITTLE MORE CLEAR THE SPEAKERS COULD SOUND MORE CRISP
IF I HAD KNOWN THE CAR I PICKED OUT DIDN T HAVE A CD PLAYER I WOULD HAVE OPTED FOR A DIFFERENT STYLE IF YOU PAY $20K FOR A CAR IT SHOULD HAVE A CD PLAYER PAPERS HAD ALREADY BEEN SIGNED WHEN THIS WAS REALIZED
I DON T EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE GPS OR IF MY CAR EVEN HAS ONE THE SIMPLE ENTER THE ADDRESS ON THE PANEL GPS NOT ONSTAR
THE APPS DONT WORK VERY WELL THE ONLY 1 THAT DOES IS PANDORA
NO CD PLAYER INCLUDED IN CAR WOULD HAVE LOVED ONE
WIFI
PUT THE ONSTAR DIRECTIONS ON THE RADIO SCREEN
MANUAL PROGRAMMING OF RADIO STATIONS
THE STATION PRESETS SHOULD BE AT BOTTOM THEY ARE HARD TO REACH WHILE DRIVING AT THE TOP
THE ONLY DOWN SIDE TO THE STEREO IS THAT WHEN YOU STOP AT A STOP SIGN FOR EXAMPLE THE VOLUME GOES DOWN THEN WHEN YOU ACCELERATE IT GOES BACK UP THE VOICE COMMANDS ON THE NAVI ARE MISHEARD ALOT
SHOULD HAVE BLUETOOTH AND A CD PLAYER THE DIALS FOR THE RADIO ARE TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE DRIVER UNLESS YOU ARE A VERY BIG PERSON
TO ALLOW PASSENGER TO ENTER NAVIGATION DESTINANTION WHILE VEHICHLE IS MOVING
READ TEXT FEATURE EASIER TO USE
NAVIGATION REQUIRES YOU TO TYPE IN THE STATE FIRST TO BEGIN ROUTING NAVIGATION WISH YOU COULD JUST TYPE IN A STREET ADDRESS AND HAVE THE SYSTEM PROVIDE A LIST OF ADDRESSES TO SELECT FROM ALSO WISH IT HAD A PAUSE BUTTON ON THE SCREEN DURING NAVIG
DONT USE NAVIGATION AND ONLINE FEATURES BECAUSE OF THE COST ALSO ONLY CAN USE THE ICONNECT SYSTEM THROUGH SPRINT WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN MY AREA WOULD PROBABLY SUBSCRIBE IF IT WAS VERIZON
I DON T USE FACEBOOK OR SOCIAL MEDIA SO THOSE APPS AND ASPECTS ARE NOT VERY USEFUL TO ME THOUGH I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF PEOPLE DO FIND THEM USEFUL WHEN I AM IN MY VEHICLE I AM IN THERE TO DRIVE AND TO GET TO A DESTINATION I CAN USE ANY OF MY OTHER
YOU HAVE TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR AUDIO ITS ONLY A 5 SCREEN WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO LOOK AWAY AND HAVE TO TOUCH A SCREEN AS OPPOSED TO USING A KNOB
THE DRIVER I TEND NOT TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY I M 72 YEARS OLD
IMPROVE ABILITY OF THOSE IN BACK SEAT TO TALK ON BLUETOOTH
THE TOM TOM NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS PLACED IN A POOR LOCATION IT BLOCKS THE VIEW OF MOVING VEHICLES LIGHTS ON MY RIGHT MOST OF THE TIME I TOOK IT OFF SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON T WANT TO MISS SEEING TURN SIGNALS FROM OTHER CARS
YOU HAVE TO USE THE UCONNECT APP TO BE ABLE TO STREAM MUSIC THROUGH A USB AND CHARGE THE PHONE AND IF YOU WANT TO CHARGE THE PHONE IT TAKES OVER THE AUDIO SYSTEM SO YOU RE FORCED TO USE THE APP TO LISTEN TO INTERNET RADIO ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE
AUDIO STREAMING OVER BLUETOOTH WITH LIBRARY BROWSING
BIGGER SCREEN ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE OF US VISUALLY IMPAIRED THE SCREEN IS SO SMALL THAT THE NAV SYSTEM OR BACK UP CAMERA IS HARD FOR ME TO SEE WITHOUT MY READING GLASSES IF YOUR ABLE TO WAT H A DVD GOOD LUCK WITH SUCH A SMALL SCREEN
BLUETOOTH ONLY CONNECTS TO PHONE CALL NOT MUSIC DON T UNDERSTAND HOW HARD TO MAKE IT BE ABLE TO STREAM MUSIC TO THE CAR
I WOULD LIKE TO CONNECT THE AUDIO VIA BLUETOOTH INSTEAD OF VIA USB
I WISH IT HAD SIRIUS XM AS STANDARD FEATURE AS KIA HAS ON ALL ITS VEHICLES
MOSTLY THE VOLUME HAS BEEN A CONCERN WITH BLUETOOTH AND THE LOOK OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM S DISPLAY COULD BE A BIT BETTER
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SATELLITE RADIO STANDARD
TECHNOLOGY WISE THIS CAR FEELS SO BEHIND FOR A TOP OF THE LINE ABARTH NO STANDARD NAVIGATION THE STOCK HEAD UNIT IS ONE COLOR AND CAN ONLY SHOW 1 LINE OF TEXT AT A TIME JUST WISH THEY PUT MORE INTO IT CAR DRIVES LIKE A DREAM THOUGH THE
SOUND QUALITY IS ACCEPTABLE BUT COULD BE IMPROVED
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
THE SOUND IS NOT VERY CLEAR AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT GOOD AT ALL
NAVIGATION ZOOM SHOULD STAY IN POSITION LONGER
ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS WAY TOO COMPLEX ESPECIALLY FOR NAVIGATING IPOD MENUS
PREFERRED WHEN USB PLUG IN WAS IN GLOVE BOX
VOICE RECOGNITION ACCURACY
DON T HAVE SALESPERSON LIE TO ME ABOUT SATELLITE RADIO
I DO NOT LIKE THAT THE STEREO MAXES OUT AT 40 THE USB CONNECTION CAN ALSO BE BUGGY WHEN PLAYING DIRECT FROM PHONE IT WILL CUT OUT AND THAN CUT BACK ON THIS HESITATION IS REGARDLESS IF IT IS PLUGGED INTO THE USB PORT OR PHONE TO CAR
PUTTING IN THE ADDRESS FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
MAKE THE VOICE ACTIVATION SYSTEM MORE ACCURATE IN RESPONDING TO INSTRUCTIONS
ANYTHING CONNECTING THROUGH SYNC SERVICES TENDS TO NOT WORK VERY WELL VOICE RECOGNITION OVER THE PHONE IS TERRIBLE
MY MAIN ISSUE IS THE RADIO PRE SET OPTIONS IT S HARD TO GET TO ALL YOUR PRESETS
VOICE RECOGNITION EASE OF COMMANDS
EASIER NAV SYSTEM LIKE GOOGLE MAPS OR A GARMIN NAV SYSTEM
RADIO STATION SELECTION HAVE TO LOOK AT TOUCH SCREEN DISTRACTING
VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION IS HARD TO USE
SOFTWARE NEEDS A LOT OF WORK VR CONTROLS AND MENUS ARE NOT INTUITIVE NAV SYSTEM MAPS ARE WAY OUT OF DATE MY CELLPHONE MOTOROLA DROID MAXX DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB OVERALL WHY NOT JUST PORT THE CELL PHONE DISPLAY TO THE TOUCH SCREEN
MAKE QUICKER TO ENTER DESTINATION CANCEL GUIDANCE
VOICE CONTROLS ARE NOT VERY GOOD I USUALLY HAVE TO STATE MULTIPLE TIMES WHAT RADIO STATION I WANT WHEN MAKING A CALL I OFTEN GIVE UP UNTIL I CAN PULL OVER AND PUSH BUTTONS THEN DRIVE WHILE I M HAVING A CONVERSATION
DESTINATION NOT EASY TO PROGRAM ON NAV SYSTEM
THE SYNC APP IS HORRIBLE AND RARELY WORKS HARD TO NAVIGATE REFERRING TO IPHONE COMPATIBILITY MOST FRUSTRATING IS APPLE WONT ALLOW TEXT TO SPEECH VIA BT UNLIKE ABNDROID
I DO NOT USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOVE THE SOUND OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OFTEN DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHEN I TRY TO ENTER AN ADDRESS AND I HAVE TO CALL THE OPERATOR
BLUETOOTH MEDIA CONNECTIVITY
SOUND QUALITY OF FACTORY AUDIO SYSTEM
I HAVE TO TURN OFF THE BLUE & ME ON MY CELL PHONE BECAUSE I CANNOT USE MY PHONE GPS APPARENTLY THE PHONE IS NOT NEW ENOUGH TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE CAR S BLUE & ME SO I HAVE TO STRAIN TO HEAR THE DIRECTIONS
IF I HAD THE BEATS AUDIO I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE GIVEN IT HIGHER RATINGS
HIDDEN STEERING CONTROLS ARE NICE BUT DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER THEM ALL SINCE THEY ARE ON THE BACK OF THE WHEEL
THE NAV SHOULD BE PART OF THE DASHBOARD NOT MOUNTED
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT BLOCK YOUR FORWARD VIEW
DUMP SONY SOUND FOR JBL SOUND SONY IS BARELY AN UPGRADE OVER THE BASIC SOUND
VOICE RECOGNITION HELPS TO IDENTIFY THE CALLER WHEN HE SHE CALLS
DIFFICULT TO MASTER THE COMMAND STRUCTURE FOR CONTROLLING THE AUDIO SYSTEM VIA VOICE
SOUNDS FINE WISH IT HAD A MULTI CD PLAYER TO LISTEN TO BOOKS ON LONG DRIVES SALESMAN TOLD ME THAT NO ONE LISTENS TO CDS ANYMORE THE NAVIGATION IS GETTING EASIER BUT IT SEEMS TIME CONSUMING TO ME I LIKE HAVING THE FEATURE OF NAVIGATION
TOUCH SCREEN IS HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING I AM IN MY SEVENTIES AND DO NOT LIKE TAKING MY ATTENTION OFF THE ROAD
THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE IS DIFFICULT TO USE THANKFULLY THE TOUCH SCREEN AND THE KNOBS ARE VERY USER FRIENDLY
TOUCH SCREEN IS AT AN AWKWARD ANGLE BIG LEARNING CURVE TO UNDO ANY MISTAKES IN COMMUNICATION
NEEDS TO WORK BETTER WITH IPHONE
ALL THE ABOVE ASSURE A HIGH LEVEL OF TECH SAVY WHICH THOSE OF MY AGE DON T NORMALLY HAVE
WISH THE MAP FUNCTION WOULD SHOW MORE STREETS WHEN ZOOMED OUT
VOICE ACTIVATION COULD BETTER UNDERSTAND MY DIRECTION
HEALTH REPORT HAS NEVER WORKED WITH SUPPORTED PHONE SETUP OF PHONE ADDRESS BOOK AND DESTINATIONS FOR NAVIGATION IS AWKWARD IF IT WORKS ANYTHING PAST THE BASICS REQUIRES TOO MUCH INVESTMENT IN TRAINING AND RESEARCH OF METHODS AND OPTIONS AFTE
BLUETOOTH CELL PHONE CALLS DON T ALWAYS SOUND CLEAR AND THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END SOMETIMES SAYS THEY CAN T UNDERSTAND ME
IT D BE NICE IF THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY COULD BE CUSTOMIZED BY THE USER IT S ALSO RATHER FRUSTRATING THAT EVEN THOUGH THE APPLE IPHONE IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR CELLPHONES MY FORD ESCAPE DOESN T SUPPORT THE VIEWING READING OF TEXT MESSAGES FR
BLUETOOTH SHOULD BE STANDARD IT WOULD MAXIMIZE MY CONTROL TO MUSIC AS WELL AS CALL
RETURN OF THE JUKEBOX SYSTEM
THE SOUND QUALITY ON THE SPEAKERS IS NOT WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM A SYSTEM IN A NICER MODEL VEHICLE IT LACK IN CLARITY AND BASS
THE NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE
VOICE COMMAND WHEN USING PHONE DIRECTORY DOES NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THE NAME
TOO COMPLICATED WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T WORK CONSISTENTLY
CONFUSING LANGUAGE CHOICES TO SELECT DESTINATION DO NOT LIKE DISPLAY CHOICES WILL NOT USE THEM WHILE DRIVING
VOICE CONTROLS
HAVE DIFFICULTY HEARING SOME PHONE CALL HAVE STATIC SOUND WITH SOME PHONE CALL HAVE LOST PHONE CALLS DON T KNOW IF THIS IS FROM THE EXPLORER OR MAYBE THE PHONE SYSTEM OF WHO I AM TALKING TO SELDOM HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH ON STAR WHEN I HAD
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN ASKING TO MAKE A PHONE CALL
SYNCH VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETIMES FRUSTRATING WHEN SHE DOESN T RECOGNIZE WHAT I AM ASKING FOR ALSO QUALITY OF CALLS COMBINED WITH ROAD NOISE COULD PROBABLY BE A BIT BETTER
VOICE ACTIVATION SYSTEM IS NOT INTUITIVE TO USE
GO BACK TO BUTTONS GET RID OF TOUCHSCREEN ELEMENTS
CANNOT USE NAVIGATION BUTTONS WHEN DRIVING BUT YOU CAN IN MY HONDA WHICH I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO
NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION
MAKE NAV EASIER TO USE
THE SYNC IS A LITTLE TEMPERMENTAL SOMETIMES BUT HAS BEEN IN MOST VEHICLES
VOICE RECOGNITION OF THE NAV SYSTEM ESPECIALLY FOR FINDING A STREET ADDRESS
THE SCREEN WHERE I CAN SELECT FM AM SATELLITE BLUETOOTH ETC THE MENU IS KIND OF CHALLENGING HAVING TO SCROLL DOWN TO VIEW ALL OF THE CHOICES IT ISN T SUPER RESPONSIVE AND REQUIRES MULTIPLE TAPS SOMETIMES COULD BE BECAUSE I AM TRYING TO WAT
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T WORK
WE FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM VERY HARD TO USE I END UP USING MY IPHONE NAVIGATION INSTEAD OF THE CAR
VOICE RECOGNITION IS A HORRIBLE WAY TO INTERACT WITH THE SYSTEM IF IT HAD AI AND COULD UNDERSTAND YOUR INTENTIONS IT MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IT IS A NOVELTY THAT PROMOTES FRUSTRATION AND THEN ACTUALLY TAKING YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD AND IN MY OPINION
PLEASE MOVE TO AN ALTERNATIVE FOR SYNC
DOES NOT READ MY HTC ONE M 8 HD RADIO NOT RELIABLE
FORD S NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT UP THE EASE OF USE LEVEL AVAILABLE WITH GARMIN YOU CANNOT SIMPLY TYPE IN THE NAME OF A DESTINATION
NOT THAT IMPRESSED WITH OVER ALL SOUND QUALITY FOR A PREMIUM SOUND PACKAGE
F 350 NEED RV NAV OPTION
TOUCH SCREEN BUTTON AREAS SHOULD BE LARGER LIKE WHEN SELECTING A PRESET RADIO STATION
SEVERAL TIMES PHONE DID NOT SYNC WITH TRUCK AFTER TURNING OFF THE TRUCK AND THEN BACK ON BEFORE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED
NOT INTERESTED IN ALL THE NEW GADGETS
THEY SHOULD CHANGE THE NAVIGATION TO GARMIN
SOUND QUALITY IS SO SO NOT A VERY CRISP BALANCED SOUND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A LITTLE SLOW TO PROGRAM WHEN PUTTING IN SPECIFIC ADDRESSES MY USB PORT TENDS TO TELL ME I HAVE AN UNSUPPORTED DEVICE WHEN IT S A MICROSOFT WINDOWS PHONE VERY
HARD TO PLUG IN DESTINATION ADDRESS HAVE TO PUSH BUTTONS HARD AND ORDER OF PUTTING IN ADDRESS INFO IS CONFUSING
CONVENTIONAL CONTROLS COULD BE SIMPLIFIED THE BUTTONS LOOK GOOD BUT ARE HARDER TO USE THAN FORD AUDIO SYSTEMS OF THE PAST
SYNC SYSTEM CONTROLS COULD BE EASIER USE
BETTER SOUND BLUETOOTH UNDERSTANING COMANDS
THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT GREAT
THE SCREEN IS AWFUL THE INTEGRATION OF APPS IS SUBPAR
I NEVER WAS ABLE TO TURN ON SIGN IN TO THE SIRIUS SYSTEM SINCE I WAS NOT GOING TO USE IT I GAVE UP TRYING
HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY A CD EXCEPT BY EJECTING AND STARTING IT AGAIN ONCE YOU LISTEN TO THE RADIO WHILE A CD IS IN THE PLAYER IT IS NOT AT ALL OBVIOUS HOW TO SWITCH BACK TO THE CD
THE VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM COULD BE BETTER IT HAS A HARD TIME PICKING UP VERBAL COMMANDS
CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO STREAM MUSIC WIRELESSLY FROM MY IPHONE TO THE CAR S SOUND SYSTEM
THERE ARE TOO MANY STEPS IN ORDER TO PLAY MP3 PLAYER I POD ETC IT SHOULD BE JUST ONE BUTTON TO PUSH TO TURN ON
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE
LONG DISTANCE SETTING FOR GPS NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT LOCAL STUFF IS GOOD
DURING CALLS I AM OFTEN ASKED TO REPEAT MYSELF BECAUSE THEY COULDN T HEAR ME WELL ENOUGH THIS OCCURS AT SLOW AND FAST SPEEDS AND I AM ALWAYS LOOKING STRAIGHT OUT THE WINDSHIELD MY FEELING IS THE MICROPHONE IS NOT POSITIONED WELL OR SENSITIVE E
VOICE COMMAND IS A LITTLE SLOW IN RESPONSE
THE SPEAKERS DONT SOUND GOOD WHEN OVER 20 AND THE USB DEVISE DOESNT WORK WITH MY PHONE
THE TRUCK IS ONLY NAV READY NOT HAPPY WITH THAT
LOVE THE TURNING VEHICLE ON THE DASHBOARD USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE TEXT TO MESSAGE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR APPLE PRODUCTS ALL OF MY FAMILIES PHONES ARE APPLE THE BLUETOOTH AND USB DON T COOPERATE ALL OF THE TIME WHEN PLAYING MUSIC THIS IS THE ONLY DISAPPOINTING FEATURE OF THE VEHICLE
THE NAVIGATION I WISH THE 8 4A AND 8 4AN CAN BE INTERCHANGED SO WHEN THE DEALER LIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS AND THEN DON T DELIVER IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR THE CUSTOMERS TO MAKE THE DEALERS KEEP THEIR WORD AND GIVE US THE SYSTEM WE WANTED IN THE FIRST PLACE
THE SPEAKERS SOUND QUALITY IS POOR
CHARGE CELL PHONE WITH KEY OFF BE NICE TO HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
EASE OF LOCATING AND STORING RADIO STATIONS
I LOVE THE USER INTERFACE AND THE QUALITY OF THE TRUCK S ENTERTAINMENT COMMUNICATIONS AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM REALLY GREAT WORK
POSITIONING OF THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY
FOR SOME REASON THE UCONNECT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK WITH IPHONES OTHER THAN TO PLACE CALL I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEND TEXTS HANDSFREE THROUGH THE UCONNECT SYSTEM
PUT IN A BUILT IN DVD PLAYER FOR REAR ENTERTAINMENT
VOICE CONTROLS DO NOT WORK PHONE IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE CAR
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE AUX CONNECTION NEAR THE DASHBOARD AND NOT IN THE CENTER GLOVE BOX
VOICE RECOGNITION IS FRUSTRATING AT TIMES
NEEDS A USER ADJUSTABLE VOLUME CONTROL ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOICE THIS IS A CONVERTIBLE
MOVE AWAY FROM BLUETOOTH SYNC TECHNOLOGIES AND INCORPORATE THE APPLE IN VEHICLE SYSTEM
TOUCH SCREEN ACCURACY COULD BE BETTER
WELL THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS DON T WORK SO THAT DOESN T HELP MATTERS
ALL TAURUS SHOULD COME WITH A PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM
IT TAKES AWHILE TO LEARN HOW TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DIRECTIONS COULD BE MORE CLEAR
DON T KNOW BECAUSE I ONLY USE THE SATELLITE RADIO FEATURE
USB COULD DO WITH A BETTER CONNECTION INTERFACE
NEED A NAVIGATION GPS SYSTEM FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY
ALLOW FOR A SHUFFLE FEATURE FOR THE MUSIC STORED ON A FLASH DRIVE
LESS BACKGROUND NOISE IN PHONE CALLS
THE TOUCH CONTROLS ARE NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND
HD RADIO SHOULD BE STANDARD NOT PART OF AN EXPENSIVE OPTION PACKAGE
IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO REPEAT COMMANDS AT ALL
THE EASE OF HANDS FREE VOICE COMMANDS COULD BE IMPROVED AS IT RELATES TO THE SYSTEM UNDERSTANDING MY WORDS
I DON T CARE FOR THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE OPTIONAL SHAKER AUDIO SYSTEM IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN UPGRADE FROM THE STANDARD SYSTEM BUT IN MY OPINION THE STANDARD SYSTEM SOUNDS BETTER I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE THE SHAKER SYSTEM
I HAVE HAD SEVERAL INDASH NAVIGATION UNITS ALL OF THEM HAVE THEIR OWN WAY FOR USER INPUT AND HOW THEY WORK SO I WOULD RECOMMEND INCLUDING AN INSTRUCTIONAL TUTORIAL DVD ON HOW TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE S AUDIO INFOTAINMENT SYSTEMS
MAKE IT EASIER TO USE  AND MAKE IT MORE EASILY COMPATIBLE WITH MORE DEVICES AND APPS
WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE THE RECEIVING CELL PHONE HAS A DISTANCE FACTOR THAT MAKES THE PERSON IN THE VEHICLE SOUND FAR AWAY
PAID A LOT IN CASH FOR CAR NO NAVIGATION OR EVEN CELL PHONE HANDS FREE
SO FAR HANDS FREE PHONE BUT I AM STILL LEARNING TO USE MORE FEATURES
BLUETOOTH HAS HARD TIME HEARING
SHOULD HAVE SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE USING MY IPOD IS THAT I HAVE TO ALSO PLUG IT INTO A POWER SUPPLY AT THE SAME TIME IT IS PLUGGED INTO THE AUX JACK OTHERWISE WHEN THE SCREEN GOES BLANK AFTER SEVERAL SECONDS THE MUSIC BOOK CUTS OFF WHEN IT IS PLUGGED I
LOVE THE AUDIO BUT WHEN USING THE PHONE I CAN HEAR PEOPLE VERY WELL BUT THEY HEAR A LOT OF BACK GROUND NOISE NO MATTER WHAT I TRY I VE BEEN USING A BOSE BLUETOOTH FOR 2 YEARS AND WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO USE IN CAR SYSTEM BUT SOMETIMES I NEE
I PURCHASED A LOW END VEHICLE SO IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY SPECIAL AUDIO OPTIONS BUT I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND OUT THAT I DON T EVEN HAVE A CD PLAYER RADIO ONLY
LARGER SCREEN WITH TOUCH CONTROLS
SOMETIMES HAVE PROBLEM WITH VOICE ACTIVATED CALLING GIVES THE WRONG NAME WHEN MAKING CALLS
TAKE OUT ALL THE STUPID NUMBER BUTTONS THAT ARE ONLY THERE TO TYPE IN RADIO STATIONS
WHEN USING BLUETOOTH THE CALLS ARE NOT VERY CLEAR TENDS TO BE VERY LOUD AND POOR QUALITY TO THE PERSON I M CALLING
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT THE GREATEST IT NEVER UNDERSTANDS ME
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CUMBERSOME AND NOT USER FRIENDLY \
TOUCH SCREEN MENU IS A BOTHER TO USE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY ALSO TOOK ME DOWN EITHER THE LONGEST ROUTE OR INCORRECT ROUTE DON T USE AT ALL I PREFER TO USE MAPQUEST OFF PHONE AS IT IS MORE RELIABLE
IMPROVING THE SPEECH INPUT FOR ROUTE GUIDANCE
COMMUNICATION TOUCH DISPLAY IS SIMPLY NOT USER FRIENDLY
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS VERY BUSY IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO READ A TURN BY TURN LIST AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE ALTERNATE ROUTES WOULD BE HELPFUL
TOUCH SCREEN ISN T VERY RESPONSIVE HAVE TO TAP SEVERAL TIMES OFTEN TO GET SCREEN TO RESPOND
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZE WHAT IS SAID
TOUCH SCREEN WORKS WELL PHONE CONNECTIVITY IS GREAT SHOULD HAVE OPEN SOURCE SO NOT STUCK WITH ON STAR NAVIGATION ALLOW DOWNLOADING OF OTHER APPS POSSIBLY
TAKES WAY TOO LONG TO BOOT UP ALSO BACKUP CAMERA STAYS ON TOO LONG AFTER SHIFTING FROM REVERSE TO DRIVE

THE VOICE COMMAND FEATURES CAN BE FRUSTRATING AS THEY DO NOT USUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOUR ARE SAYING TYPING IN THE COMMANDS TAKE LONGER AND IS MORE FRUSTRATING YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOCATE THE ONLY AIRPORT IN A 50 MILE RADIUS BUT IT CANT
ALLOWING ME TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS A MAP WITHOUT FIRST ENTERING A DESTINATION
SYSTEM RESPONSE TO VOICE COMMAND SUCH AS PHONE WITHOUT HAVING TO REPEAT COMMAND MULTIPLE TIMES
ACTUALLY HAVING SYNC WORK LIKE IT SHOULD WOULD BE NICE SPECIALLY FOR 27000 FOR JUST THE BASE
THE USB PORT DOESN T CONNECT SOMETIMES IT CONNECTS AND DISCONNECTS OVER AND OVER

THE HANDSFREE LINK ISN T GOOD I WOULD RATHER IT LET ME BETTER USE SIRI AS THE PHONE S RECONGNITION IS BETTER
BETTER SOUND WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK AS GOOD AS THE ONE I HAVE IN MY KIA EXTGDI
MORE PILOT MODELS SHOULD HAVE SATELLITE RADIO OPTION IN ESSENCE YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY $3500 TO GET THE NEXT MODEL WITH SATELLITE RADIO NOT WORTH IT
TALKING THROUGH BLUETOOTH WITH CELLPHONE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED WHEN TRYING TO COMMUNICATE FROM PASSENGER SEAT WORKS WELL FROM DRIVERS SEAT BUT NOT ANYWHERE ELSE IN VEHICLE
NAVIGATION MENU TO FIND ADDRESSES BASED UPON LOCATION NEEDS IMPROVEMENT I GET RESULTS FOR LOCATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY BEFORE ANYTHING NEAR ME AUDIO SYSTEM ISN T COMPATIBLE WITH A LOT OF IPODS INCLUDING NEWER
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS FAR INFERIOR TO MY OLD CAR MY FORD EXPLORER HAD AN EXCELLENT VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM
QUALITY OF BLUETOOTH SOUND
NEED TOUCH SCREEN FOR RADIO
I LIKE THE BOSE WAVE SYSTEM
TOUCH SCREEN FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT DIAL SYSTEMS IS LOUSY
THERE HAS TO BE AT LEAST ONE USB PORT ON THE DASH FOR EASY SAFE DRIVER USE MY PILOT ONLY HAS ONE LOCATED IN THE MIDDLE CONSOLE AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAFELY PLUG A DEVISE INTO IT SAFELY WHILE DRIVING A BIG FLAW THAT I WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH
NAVIGATION SHOULD SAY STREET NAME AND NOT TURN IN HALF MILE TURN IN 50 FEET IT SAYS HIGHWAY NAMES SYSTEM NEEDS TO IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION
SPEAKER QUALITY NOT AS GOOD WITH FM AS WITH SATELLITE SOUND
THAT EVEN THE BASE MODEL SHOULD COME WITH BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY A NECESSITY
ADDITIONAL USB PORTS WOULD BE WELCOME WITH HOW MANY DEVICES NOW ARE USING A USB COMPATIBLE CHARGE CABLE I HAVE NEEDED TO USE A USB SPLITTER THE SPEAKERS ARE DECENT BUT A BIT UNDERPOWERED EVEN AFTER ADJUSTING THE SOUND TO FOCUS TOWARDS THE DRI
DON T KNOW I ONLY PLUG MY MP3 PLAYER INTO IT I DON T HAVE A SMART PHONE GPS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
THEY SHOULD UPDATE HIGH END SYSTEMS TO BE MORE INTERACTIVE WITH PHONE APPS LIKE TEXT MESSAGES THROUGH THE AUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM
AUDIO SYSTEM IS GREAT I DO NOT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT ALL OTHER RADIO ENTERTAINMENT SPEAKERS ARE GREAT
SOUND QUALITY OF BLUETOOTH
VOICE COMMAND COULD BE IMPROVED I WISH THERE WERE MORE COMMANDS AVAILABLE AND THAT THE RECORDED MESSAGES WOULD BE SHORTER
THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY COULD BE LARGER AND THE DISPLAY COULD GIVE MORE INFORMATION SUCH AS THE NAME NAME OF THE SINGER AND NAME OF SONG PLAYING
WE VE NOT SPENT THE TIME LEARNING ALL YET WE ALSO HOPE TO ADD AFTER MARKET NAVIGATION SYSTEM EVENTUALLY
HAVING MY VOICE COMMANDS MORE READILY UNDERSTOOD
ONLY COMPLAINT IS SPEAKERS THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD
IT NEVER UNDERSTANDS VOICE COMMANDS I HAVE TO STOP AND MANUALLY ENTER IT

THE VOICE APPLICATIONS ARE ALMOST CRIPPLED WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO DO TEXT MESSAGING VIA HANDS FREE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT YOUR PHONE TO THE CARS AUDIO SYSTEM VIA BLUETOOTH RATHER THAN WIRE
NAV SYSTEM IS DEPLORABLE I D RATHER STICK A GARMIN TO THE WINDSHIELD THAN USE THE BUILT IN SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION IS HORRIFIC
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE DISPLAY WOULD SHOW THE ARTIST AND SONG NAME BY PULLING INFORMATION FROM THE PHONE RATHER THAN SAYING MP3 PLAYBACK ALSO A SLIGHTLY UPGRADED DISPLAY WOULD BE NICE IT S AND THEY RE STILL USING A BORING MONOCHROME DI
CLARITY OF SOUND QUALITY
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR COMMANDS TRAFFIC CONDITIONS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE
NAVIGATION A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT VOICE CONTROL HARDLY WORKS

A MULTIPLE CD PLAYER IN THE 4 CYC
HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE
NEED A PHONE SPEAKER ON PASSENGER SIDE OF VEHICLE HIGHER END ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM SHOULD BE INSTALLED IN A $50 000 VEHICLE LIKE BOSE SHOULD BE STANDARD
NAVIGATION AND VOICE CONTROL SHOULD BE JUST AS EASY TO USE AS MY IPHONE BUT IT ISN T I CAN ASK MY IPHONE FOR DIRECTIONS TO A PARTICULAR VENUE AND IT WILL GIVE ME DIRECTIONS WITHOUT GIVING ME A LONG LIST FOR ME TO GO THROUGH
CALL QUALITY VIA THE CONNECTED BLUETOOTH IS ABOUT AVERAGE I EXPECTED BETTER QUALITY GIVEN THAT THE REST OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS SUCH HIGH QUALITY
VEHICLE HAS HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING VOICE CONTROLS
I NEVER TOOK THE TIME TO SET UP THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IF IT WERE READY TO USE FROM THE START I MIGHT ACTUALLY USE THE NAVIGATION FEATURE
I DON T CARE FOR THE GOOGLE MAPS INTERFACE OF THE NAV SYSTEM
INTEGRATE WITH GOOGLE ANDROID AUTO THIS WOULD BE A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT
READ TEXT MESSAGES
VOICE RECOGNITION OF PHONE HANDS FREE FEATURE
THE SPEAKER FOR THE HANDS FREE CALLING IT COULD BE MORE SENSITIVE I HAVE TO SPEAK RATHER LOUD FOR SOMEONE TO HEAR ME
BLUETOOTH SHOULD BE AVAILABLE WHILE RADIO NOT ON
VOICE RECOGNITION AND HOW LONG IT TAKES FROM VOICE COMMAND TO GET TO THE FUNCTION
EASABILITY OF TOUCHSCREEN
THE RADIO DISPLAY IS WAY TOO BRIGHT AND THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT
I AM SO UNHAPPY WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION NAV NO MATTER WHAT I ASK SHE CAN NOT UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IS FIND STARBUCKS  IT IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING AND THE ONLY THING I WANTED A GREAT NAV SYSTEM
THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE SORT OF CONFUSING PRESSING THE UP ARROW BUTTON CHANGES THE RADIO STATION THE NEXT HIGHEST PRESET   IE FROM PRESET 2 TO PRESET 3 HOWEVER ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IT SHOWS THE PRESET BUTTONS STARTING WITH 1 A
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DUMPS YOU ON A STATE HIGHWAY WITH NO BUILDING IN SIGHT AND SAYS YOU HAVE REACHED YOUR DESTINATION
SOUND QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS PREVIOUS VEHICLE JETTA PHONE VOICE QUALITY IS POOR
SOUND SYSTEM WHEN USING BLUETOOTH ISNT AS CLEAR AS I WOULD LIKE
SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE WITH RADIO IPHONE USB SIRIUSXM INTERFACE WITH USB AND IPHONE HAS FROZE UP MY ENTIRE AUDIO SYSTEM ON A COUPLE OCCASIONS AND WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCESS ANY AUDIO CONTROLS FEATURES IN CARE UNTIL I WAS ABLE TO STOP AND TURN OFF
TOUCH SCREEN DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING

NOT HAVING TO YELL FOR SOMEONE TO HEAR YOU ON THE PHONE VOICE RECOGNITION WAS BETTER IN MY SI SPEAKERS AND RADIO SYSTEM WAS BETTER IN MY SI
COMING FROM A VEHICLE WITH A BOSE SYSTEM THE SOUND QUALITY JUST SOUNDS TIN NY AND CHEAP
NAV DATA DISPLAY OPTIONS
I WAS HAPPY WITH THE DISPLAY AND EASE OF USE OF IPOD AND OVERLAE EASE OF ENTIRE SYSTEM GOOD JOB WITH THAT THE SPEAKERS ARE JUST OK
ADD HD CAPABILITY AND MAKE SATELLITE RADIO CONNECTIVITY STANDARD ON ALL MODELS
HANDS FREE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE SIMPLIFIED I LIKED HOW IT WORKED ON MY HONDA CRV VERY EASY TO USE WITH SET UP VOICE TAGS I COULD JUST PUSH THE BUTTON SAY THE NAME AND THE CALL WOULD GO THROUGH NOW AFTER I SAY THE NAME I HAVE TO PICK FROM
BLU TOOTH CONNECTIVITY SUCKS
TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING I MUST TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD IF I WANT TO CHANGE FROM RADIO TO CD IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO JUST PRESS A BUTTON FOR THIS FUNCTION
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM OPERATION
PHONE CONNECTIVITY AND REQUIRE LESS LEVELS OF LONG INSTRUCTIONS
VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD BE EASIER
THE TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY DISTRACTING TO USE WHILE TRYING TO DRIVE LOOKING DOWN AT THE SCREEN AND DRIVING IS NEARLY AS BAD AS TEXTING AND DRIVING BUTTONS AND KNOBS
NAVIGATION GIVES HORRIBLE ROUTES
NAV SYSTEM GO COPY A $200 GARMIN AUDIO & COMMUNICATION GO COPY AN IPHONE GET A HIGH DEF SCREEN
CONSISTENCY OF SOUND WITHIN THE DIFFERENT INPUTS SATELLITE DOES T SOUND AS GOOD AS FROM IPOD HAVE TO TURN VOLUME UP TOO HIGH TO BEFORE IT STARTS TO GET LOUDER
BOSE SYSTEM WOULD BE GREAT
THE HD RADIO COMPLETELY GOES OUT IN A LOT OF AREAS WHEN I HAVE IT ON I FIND IT TO BE COMPLETELY ANNOYING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE AN OVERRIDE FOR ENTERING ADDRESS LOCATIONS WHILE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION THIS CAUSES DRIVER TO HAVE TO STOP TO ENTER THE ADDRESS THERE SHOULD BE AN OVERRIDE SO WHEN THERE IS A PERSON IN THE PASSENGER SEAT THEY COULD
NAV SYSTEM VERY AVERAGE MAP AVERAGE TURNING BELL VERY GOOD
IMPROVE EASE OF VOICE RECOGNITION WITH DESTINATIONS ROUTES
QUALITY OF PHONE CALLS NOT AS GOOD IN COMPARISON TO MY PREVIOUS INFINITI G25X CALLERS OFTEN COMPLAIN OF HEARING A LOT OF STATIC
PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE OFTEN HAVE A PROBLEM HEARING ME TALKING WHEN I USE THE HANDS FREE CALLING FEATURE OF THE CAR SO THIS COULD BE IMPROVED
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE PASSENGER COULD USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION
DON T KNOW HOW TO USE THE SIRI FEATURE OF MY IPHONE WHEN IT IS PAIRED TO THE CAR WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO SO SETTING RADIO STATIONS AND FINDING RADIO STATIONS IS NOT INTUITIVE
REDUCE NOISE INCREASE CLARITY WHILE USING BLUETOOTH FOR RECIPIENTS
I HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS MUCH AS I THOUGHT I WOULD I DO NOT FIND IT EASY TO USE THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL IS NOT THAT HELPFUL I WOULD LIKE A LIST OF STEPS IF THIS THEN THIS ETC I HAVEN T SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS I SHOULD IN LEA
ALOT OF FEATURES ARE DISABLED UNLESS THE CAR IS IN PARK I GET THAT IT IS A SAFETY FEATURE BUT SOEMTIMES THERE IS A PASSENGER AND WE ARE ON A ROAD TRIP TRYING TO NAVIGATE A DESTINATION OR A MOVIE FOR MY CRYING THREE YEAR OLD AND WE CAN T PUT THE
SOMETIMES THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WILL PLAY AUDIO BUT NOT DISPLAY THE TRACK INFORMATION FROM MY IPHONE OR ALLOW THE NEXT TRACK   PREV TRACK BUTTONS TO WORK USUALLY IT WORKS BUT NOT ALWAYS
THE CONNECTIVITY TO THE PHONE IS GREAT ONLY CHALLENGE IS SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO TURN UP THE VOLUME WHEN IT SHOUL DBE THE VOLUME ITS ALREADY AT MEANING THE RADIO WILL BE ON AT A CERTAIN VOLUME WE LL GET A CALL AND I HAVE TO TURN UP THE VOLUME IN
I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT LETTING ME PUT AN ADDRESS IN I HAD TO USE THE MAP TO TRY TO FIND WHERE I WAS GOING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE A LITTLE USER FRIENDLIER
BLUETOOTH SOUND QUALITY COULD DEFINITELY BE BETTER
NAVIGATION SYSTEM CANNOT COMPARE TO FORD NAVIGATION SYSTEM POWERED BY MICROSOFT
I FEEL THAT THE SYSTEM CAN BE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME TO NAVIGATE I E I HAVE TO GO THRU 2 SETS OF PREPROGRAMMED RADIO STATIONS TO GET TO THE THIRD ONE THAT I HAVE A STATION STORED ON ON MY OLD BMW I COULD SCROLL THRU ALL STORED STATIONS WITHOUT H
BLUETOOTH AND SATELITE IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED NOT A FAN OF ALL THE OTHER UN NEEDED FEATURES
VOICE RECOGNITION AND QUALITY OF PHONE CALLS
I HAVE A JAGUAR AND YOU DO NOT NEED A CORD TO PLAY YOUR BLUETOOTH
EASE OF USE NAVIGATION BETWEEN CONTROLS
I WISH IT COULD READ AND SEND TEXT MESSAGES FROM MY PHONE
WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE EASIER FOR THE CAR TO READ WHAT MY PHONE WAS DOING VIA BLUETOOTH BUT IT DOESN T IT NEEDS TO BE PLUGGED IN
BRING BACK HARD DRIVE MUSIC DOWNLOAD
THE ABILITY TO USE ANDROID BASED PHONES INSTEAD OF JUST APPLE PRODUCTS
THE VOLUME COULD BE A BIT HIGHER WHEN PLAYING SIRUS AND IPOD
AUXILIARY JACK AVAILABLE ALSO FM HD RADIO
EACH CAR COULD BE WITH TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY
MY MODEL DD NOT COME WITH VOICE CONTROL FOR HEATING COOLING
BLUETOOTH HANDSFREE MICROPHONE GETS COMPLAINTS CONSTANTLY FROM CALLERS
THE USB PORT IS LOCATED IN THE CENTER CONSOLE AND DIFFICULT TO ACCESS IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE FRONT PANEL
SCREEN APPEARANCE OPTIONS SINCE MOST OF THE TIME I USE AUDIO NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE SIMPLER TO ENTER ADDRESS
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY
WHEN CONNECTING A CELLPHONE THRU BLUETOOTH IT SHOULD RECOGNISE THAT SAID CELLPHONE HAS EXIT THE CAR E G W THE PASSENGER AND INTERRUPT THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION OTHERWISE CONNECTION CONTINUES AND MUSIC CUTS IN AND OUT UNTIL IT DROPS COMPLETELY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT SHOW ENOUGH STREETS AND IT IS SLOW TO SHOW STREET NAMES WHEN PRESSING SCREEN ACTUAL ROUTES AND EASE ARE VERY GOOD
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS POORLY DESIGNED TOO CLUTTERED AND DOES NOT SIMPLY IDENTIFY TRAFFIC CONGESTION THE WHOLE INFOTAINMENT SET UP IS INFERIOR TO THE COMPETITION
I LOVE MY VEHICLE S COMMUNICATION AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT IS EASY TO OPERATE
IT S OK BUT THE MAP DISPLAY IS NOT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO USE AS A LOCAL AREA STREET ROUTE INDICATOR
MAKE THE CD PLAYER ACCESIBLE TO THE DRIVER WITHOUT HAVING TO TURN INTO A CORKSCREW
GRAPHICS ON SCREEN AND SOUND OF STEREO SYSTEM
AS I SAID I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR MAKING PHONE CALLS
NAV SYSTEM IS VERY POOR ESPECIALLY COMPARED TO BMW IDRIVE AND NAV SYSTEM AUDIO CONTROLS POOR FROM STEERING WHEEL
ONLY HAVING THE VEHICLE A SHORT TIME I FIND THE MYSELF GETTING USED TO PRESET BUTTONS AND RADIO CONTROLS IN GENERAL TO BE A BIT UNMANAGEABLE UNTIL I GET USED TO IT I WILL HAVE TO TRY USING THE BUILT IN VOICE CONTROLS BUT I DID NOT BUY T

A NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE INSTALLED SINCE THE MY COMPASS DIDN T COME WITH ONE
THE LOCATION OF THE USB PORT IS IN THE MOST AWKWARD PLACE IT SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE DASH
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS DOES NOT SCAN ONLY PRESETS BUT ALSO OTHER NON PRESET STATIONS
DIFFICULT CONTROLLING AUDIO AUXILLARY WHEN USB IS CONNECTED TO PHONE SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO RECOGNIZE IPHONE AND I HAVE TO CONTROL MUSIC VIA IPHONE AND NOT THROUGH THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IT SEEMS IT WORKS INTERMITTANTLY
SINCE I CAN T USE THE BLUETOOTH WITH MY IPHONE THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE I REALLY DON T USE IT I LIKE THE SATELLITE RADIO BUT I DON T KNOW IF I WILL PAY FOR A SUBSCRIPTION WHEN THE TRIAL IS OVER I WISH I COULD USE MY IPOD VIA BLUETOOTH
FASTER BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM NO COMMUNICATION OR USB PORTS
WHEN USING NAVIGATION ON MY PHONE THE CAR PICKS UP THE INSTRUCTION AS IF IT WERE A PHONE CALL I E TURN LEFT PHONE CALL COMPLETED
BLUETOOTH SHOULD BE STANDARD USB PORT ADDED NAVIGATION SUBSCRIBE OPTION
THE CD PLAYER SKIPS JUMBLES TRACKS TO A SONG WHEN I HIT POTHOLES
THERE ARE NO RADIO CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL
IT DOESNT HAVE ANY OF THE FEAUTURES YOUVE PREVIOUSLY ASKED LIKE WEATHER UPDATE POINTS OF INTEREST TRAFFIC UPDATES BASICALLY NOTHING THAT I EXPECTED IT TO HAVE
BLUETOOTH SOUND QUALITY
THE NAV SYSTEM DOESN T REALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS AND OFTEN TIMES SENDS ME ON SLOWER ROUTES I TYPICALLY USE WAZE FOR MY NAVIGATION NEEDS
NO USB BLUETOOTH AUDIO SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO USE
CANNOT SEND TEXTS ON A WINDOWS PHONE
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM TAKES TOO LONG TO INTERPRET PROCESS VERBAL COMMANDS AND UTILIZES TOO MANY DIFFERENT PROMPTS TO INITIATE ONE SINGLE TASK AFTER A COMMAND IS GIVEN IT TAKES 3 4 SECONDS FOR THE SYSTEM TO PROCESS THE COMMAND AND INITIATE T
I AM VERY DISSAPPOINTED THAT THE VEHICAL DOES NOT CAME WITH STANDARD CD PLAYERS I LISTEN TO AUDIO BOOKS WHEN I DRIVE AND NOT HAVING A CD PLAYER MEANS THAT I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD TO A ZIP DRIVE HARD TO USE IN VEHICAL AND MORE TIME CONSUMING
BETTER SOUNDPROOFING HEADS UP DISPLAY FOR NAV AND SPEED
LOCATION OF CD PLAYER
I THINK THE UPGRADED 9 SPEAKERS ARE GOOD BUT THERE IS SOME ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT HERE I LIKE THE SPEAKERS IN THIS CAR BUT I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A MORE PREMIUM PREMIUM OPTION IT GOES FROM 9 TO 19 IF YOU GET THE HARMON KARDON ONE BUT THAT
THE USER INTERFACE TO SYNC WITH APPS PANDORA
I HAVE NAV BUT IT S AN EXTRA $20 A MONTH SO I USE MY IPHONE IT SHOULD BE PART OF THE PACKAGE
NOT HAVING TO SPEAK VERY LOUDLY WHEN USING VOICE ACTIVATED SYSTEM
MY NAVIGATION DOES NOT HAVE TRAFFIC INFORMATION EVEN WITH A SATELLITE SUBSCRIPTION FOR A THAT IS UNHEARD OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY POOR
NAVIGATION SYSTEM ISN T AS USEFUL AS IT COULD BE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TRULY DIFFICULT TO USE MUCH EASIER TO JUST USE OUR PHONE WE ALSO PREFERRED HAVING OUR CELL PHONE CHARGE CONSTANTLY DISPLAYED AS ON OUR DOES NOT RESPOND TO VOICE COMMANDS ACCURATELY FOR THE OCCASIONAL USER THIS IS DIF
WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE FEATURE FOR THE PHONE THE SYSTEM KEEPS DROPPING THE CALLS
NEEDS NAVIGATION AND HANDSFREE CALLING
ITS HARD FOR CALLERS TO HEAR ME WHEN I USE HANDS FREE
FOR THE PRICE I PAID IT SHOULD HAVE CAME WITH AT LEAST A USB PORT
REALLY DOESN T APPLY SINCE I DON T HAVE AN ENTERTAINMENT OR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
SETTING FM RADIO STATIONS
I WOULD LIKE MORE THAN ITS AN AUXILIARY PORT TO CONNECT MY PHONE
THE AUX OUTLET COULD WORK
NO VOICE COMMAND FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM VERY DISAPPOINTED AT THE LACK OF THIS CAPABILITY
DON T THINK IT UNDERSTANDS ME VERY FRUSTRATING AT TIMES SO JUST DO IT MANUALLY NOT A VERY GOOD FEATURE ON A VERY EXPENSIVE NAV SOMETIMES WE DON T LIKE THE ROUTE WANT TO AVOID GOING THRU BUSY CITIES WHEN POSSIBLE AND ITS TOLD US TO GO THE WRONG WAY
CANNOT PLAY AUDIO MP3 MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH FROM MY PHONE BLUETOOTH ONLY CONNECTS THE PHONE FEATURES TO THE AUDIO SYSTEM
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY SMALL SO SMALL THAT THE SONG AND ARTIST INFORMATION DOES NOT FULLY DISPLAY ON SCREEN THIS WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM IF THE DISPLAY SCROLLED THE INFORMATION HOWEVER IT DOES NOT OTHER THAN THAT THE SCREEN IS ADEQUATE I
THE NAVIGATION DASHBOARD IS TOO SMALL AND NEEDS TO BE BIGGER ALSO THE DISPLAY COULD BE A LOT MORE ATTRACTIVE
I AM ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE LEFT WHO DO NOT OWN A CELL PHONE SO I REALLY CAN T ANSWER THESE TYPE QUESTIONS
ON THE REGULAR TOUCH SCREEN WITHOUT NAVIGATION THE SIZE OF THE SCREEN COULD BE LARGER
HOW ABOUT A BRAND NAME SPEAKERS LIKE BOSE
WOULD LIKE TO GET MORE VOLUME OUT OF STEREO  DONT USE NAV SYSTEM TO MUCH DONT WANT TO PAY FOR IT WHEN I CAN USE VARIOUS NAV MAP APPS ON MY PHONE AND GENERALLY IF I DON T KNOW WHERE I M GOING I DONT GO
I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS OPERATING THE NAVIGATION IT IS COMPLICATED TO ACCESS IT
AS I HAVE STATED BEFORE THE MAP WHICH I ASSUMED WAS THE CURRENT ONE SHOULD BE UPDATED PRIOR TO THE SALE AND IF NOT THE PURCHASER SHOULD BE ADVISED THAT YOU CANNOT PRESUME THAT THE MAP IS THE MOST CURRENT
IF YOU GET THE NAVIGATION SCREEN ITS PRETTY BIG IF YOU DON T GET THE NAVIGATION THE SCREEN IS TINY
RICHER SOUND QUALITY THROUGH THE RADIO
SCREEN CANNOT BE SEEN WHEN SUN ON DASH SO A VISOR OR HOOD MAY IMPROVE VISABILITY ALSO PROVIDING FOR A FINGERPRINT PROOF MATERIAL FOR THE SCREEN WOULD MINIMIZE OR ALLEVIATE HAVING TO CLEAN FINGER SMUDGES EVERY 5 10 MINUTES AFTER CHANGING CHANNELS
SO FIRST GRACENOTE IS TOO SLOW AND I M NOT EVEN CERTAIN WHAT IT DOES ALSO IT S AWESOME THAT I CAN USE THE VOICE SYSTEM TO PLAY MUSIC ON MY IPOD BUT IT S INCONSISTENT AND DOESN T ALWAYS WORK TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE NICE TO PUT MY OWN START UP I
THE NAVIGATION HAS TO BE BETTER AT RECOGNIZING MULTIPLE NAMES FOR THE SAME ROAD
I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT A LOT OF THE VOICE COMMANDS THE ONES I USED WITH MY OLD CAR S SYSTEM FORD SYNC DO NOT WORK IN THIS CAR
SIMPLIFY NAV SYSTEM I ATTEMPTED TO FIND ROUTE BY PHONE NUMBER THE SYSTEM CONTINUOUSLY ENTERED THE LAST TWO DIGITS OF THE PHONE NUMBER WITHOUT INPUT THE DIGITS WERE INCORRECT AND COULD NOT BE OVER RIDDEN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM I SUGGEST TO JUST CONNECT TO GOOGLE MAPS OR GIVE THE OPTION OF NOT HAVING A NAVIGATION SYSTEM I DID NOT LIKE IT AND DID NOT WANT IT BUT HAD TO ACQUIRE IN ORDER TO HAVE OTHER FEATURES I REALLY WANTED
OUTSOURCE THIS USE A GOOGLE OR AN APPLE OR ANYBODY WHO ACTUALLY DEVELOPS SOFTWARE THE SYSTEM IS SLOW AND ANNOYING
ONE THE NAVIGATION ON MY IPHONE 6 PLUS OS8 3 DOESN T WORK CAN NOT HEAR VOICE ONLY TIME IT WORKS IS IF I AM ON ITUNES RADIO TWO GETTING ME TO THE NUMBER I LIKE TO CALL TAKES A FEW TRY S FOR IT TO UNDERSTAND MY DIRECTIONS
SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER THE SPEAKERS ARE WEAK
PLAYLIST IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE OR DOES NOT APPEAR AT ALL WHEN USING IPHONE
BETTER CONTROLS APPS ARE SILLY I WILL NOT PAY FOR SOMETHING I ALREADY PAY FOR ON MY SMART PHONE SPEAKERS HAVE AN OCCASIONAL ODD TUNNEL SOUND
AUDIO SYSTEM IS GREAT HOWEVER THE NAVIGATION ALTHOUGH LOOKS NICE LOOKS VERY DATED THE NAVIGATION ON MY PHONE TAKES BETTER ROUTES THAN THE NAVIGATION IN MY CAR
IF NAVIGATION IS ON AND YOU RECEIVE A CALL THE MAP DISPLAY DISAPPEARS AND VOICE NAVIGATION CANNOT BE HEARD THE MAP DISPLY SHOULD GO BACK ONCE YOU ANSWER THE CALL I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND MISSED A TURN OR EXIT
DOESNT WORK RIGHT WITH ANDROID PHONE
I WISH THE VEHICLE COULD READ AND COMPOSE TEXTS BUT I CAN EASILY DISMISS THEM I ALSO WISH I COULD USE VOICE TO CHOOSE A TRACK ARTIST ETC
GET COMPLAINTS WHEN USING HANDSFREE THAT IT SOUNDS NOISY AND IS OBVIOUS SPEAKERPHONE IS ON
BETTER QUALITY SOUND TRANSMISSION ON OUTBOUND VOICE THRU IPHONE TO ANOTHER PERSON
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAS TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING WHAT I AM SAYING SOME TIMES
HANDS FREE AND BLUETOOTH ACCESS TO PHONE AND MUSIC
NOISE CANCELLATION FOR HANDS FREE PHONE USAGE BETTER MIC
NAV SYSTEM WHEN USING THE MAP I LIKE TO ZOOM OUT SO I CAN SEE THE TRAFFIC WHERE I AM GOING THE ZOOM OUT ONLY LASTS A FEW SECONDS THEN IT IS BACK TO WHERE IT STARTED FROM I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HAVE A WEATHER MAP WITH WARNINGS AND OR RADAR AS
I DON T HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND I REALLYWANTED IT IN MY CAR
I DO WISH THE PHONE SYSTEM COULD COMPOSE TEXTS THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM
WHEN TRYING TO USE WAZE NAVIGATION SYSTEM VIA USB CONNECTION TO IPHONE VEHICLE WILL SWITCH TO PLAYING MUSIC FROM ITUNES WITHOUT BEING TOLD TO AND WILL NOT SWITCH BACK TO WAZE
DISPLAY COULD BE LARGER AND A LITTLE LESS GENERIC SOUND QUALITY IS OKAY COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER TOUCH SCREEN SHOULD BE STANDARD TOO HARD TO HIT ALL THE CONTROLS NAVIGATING THE BLUETOOTH ETC
VOICE COMMANDS MAKE ALOT OF MISTAKES
POOR VOICE RECOGNITION CAN T PLAY AUDIO FORM CONNECTED APPS ON SMARTPHONE CONNECTED TO BLUETOOTH
IT S DIFFICULT TO LEARN FOR SOMEONE WHO S NOT VERY TECH SAVVY I VE TRIED USING GPS A FEW TIMES & WASN T SUCCESSFUL
USB PROGRAMMING FOR MUSIC FILES IS REALLY BAD AS IS VOICE RECOGNITION
I FEEL THAT ALL KIAS SHOULD HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND MINE DOESN T
HANDS FREE PHONE CONVERSATIONS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO HEAR WITH ROAD NOISE ALSO WONDER IF SPEED ADJUST VOLUME CONTROL IS REALLY FUNCTIONING WELL
I M SURE IF THERE WAS NOT SO MUCH ROAD NOISE THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WOULD BE BETTER QUALITY
SIMPLY PUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SUCKS
I HAVE A PRETTY BASIC SYSTEM BUT WHEN MY PHONE IS PLUGGED IN I STILL HAVE TO HOLD MY PHONE TO MY EAR TO HEAR IT IF I M NAVIGATING THROUGH MY PHONE THE DIRECTIONS GO THROUGH THE SPEAKERS BUT MY PHONE CALLS DON T I WISH I COULD USE MY PHONE HAND
MOST CARS ARE PROVIDING FEATURES SUCH AS BLUETOOTH AS PART OF BASIC PACKAGE KIA USED TO PROVIDE A VERY LOADED BASIC FEATURES YEARS A GO NOW EVERYTHING IS EXTRA AND FEATURES FOR MY MONEY ARE NOT RELEVANT KIA IS MODELING TO FAILED US AUTOMAKERS
I HAVE A VERY BASIC STOCK VEHICLE SO I DON T HAVE ANY COMMUNICATION OR NAVIGATION SYSTEMS THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OPTIONS FOR THE EQ ADJUSTMENTS ALSO USING AN IPOD OR SIMILAR DEVICE IS SOMETIMES A HASSLE WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE ARTISTS OR OTHER CATEGO
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS NOT NEEDED
I THINK THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR THE KIA VEHICLES OUGHT TO BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT AND IF SO IN MY ESTIMATION WOULD BE LESS COST IF EVERY VEHICLE HAS IT INSTALLED
TOUCH SCREEN FEATURE
THE BLUETOOTH SLOWS MY PHONE DOWN A LOT
MICROSOFT UVO CAN BE ELIMINATED I TRIED SETTING IT UP BUT SOON REALIZED IT WAS JUST A CLUNKY AND STRANGE APPLICATION MULTIPLE BLUETOOTH CONNECTED PHONES IN THE CAR CAN CAUSE SOME ISSUES AUDIO CONTROLS FOR STATION PRESETS ARE ONLY USEFUL WITH TH
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SCAN RADIO STATIONS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL
MANUAL EXPLANATION OF AUDIO SYSTEM WAS POOR AND DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND LACKED INFORMATIVE STEPS NOT USER FRIENDLY
WHEN CONNECTING TO USB WITH MEDIA DEVICE SOMETIMES THE DEVICE WILL NOT CHARGE NOT SURE IF IT S A CABLE ISSUE OR SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE PORT
SOUND QUALITY AND AUDIO DISPLAY
SOUND QUALITY WHEN MAKING PHONE CALLS BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
FOLKS ON THE OTHER END OF PHONE CALLS SAY THAT IT S HARD TO HEAR ME THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH
NAVIGATION SOUND QUALITY ON PHONE CALLS SOUNDS TINNY OR LIKE THE SOUND IS COMING OUT OF A TUNNEL
LIKE THE HANDS FREE BUT VOICE CONTROL IS NOT VERY GOOD
FOR THIS CAR THE RADIO SPEAKERS AND TOTAL AUDIO SYSTEM IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FOR THE SIZE AND BEAUTY OF THIS CAR IT SHOULD SOUND LIKE A DISCO
ALL COMPONENTS SHOULD BE VOICE ACTIVATED TO AVOID BREAKING EYESIGHT WITH ROAD WHEN DRIVING
A VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM THAT WORKS EVEN AFTER A COUPLE MONTHS IT STILL WON T RECOGNIZE MY VOICE
I DO NOT USE NAVIGATION COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO RATE I AM IN MY 60 S AND DO NOT NEED DISTRACTIONS IN THE CAR I JUST DRIVE AND LISTEN TO RADIO
CD PLAYER
I HAVE NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM
GREAT CONNECTION WHEN MAKING PHONE CALLS
HOW TO SET AM RADIO STATIONS
ABILITY TO ANGLE TOUCH SCREEN TOWARD DRIVER SO GLARE DOESN T INTERFERE WITH ABILITY TO READ SCREEN WOULD BE GOOD CAN T EVEN READ CLOCK MOST OF THE TIME
AUDIO COMMANDS ARE NOT ALWAYS HEARD MAY BE A PROBLEM WITH MY CELL PHONE
INCREASE ACCURACY OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM
QUALITY OF SOUND ON PHONE CALLS
NO NAVI BUT THE BLUETOOTH WORKS FLAWLESSLY WITH EITHER MAKING CALLS OR PLAYING MUSIC FROM MY PHONE
I AM UPSET CD PLAYER ARE NOT INSTALLED IN SOULS I USE MINE
SATELLITE RADIO IS MUFFLED AND BLUETOOTH IS NOT AS LOUD AND CLEAR AS RADIO
IT WAS ONLY A TEASE WITH 3 MONTHS OF SIRIUS RADIO SERVICE BEING A SENIOR I CAN T AFFORD THIS SERVICE FOR LONGER PERIODS
REALLY NEED TO BRING BACK PHYSICAL BUTTONS TO SEEK THE RADIO STATIONS HAVING TO GO INTO THE RADIO MODULE ON THE SCREEN IS A PAIN
POOR NAVIGATION BETWEEN AUDIO NAVIGATION AND VISUAL POOR DESIGN AND CONFUSING
THE LAND ROVER JAGUAR INCONTROL APPS FEATURE VERY CONFUSING WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO WORK WITH IT THEY SAY THERE ARE APPS TO MANAGE TEXTS WHILE DRIVING BUT WHEN YOU TRY TO DOWNLOAD THE APP IT DOESN T EXIST I HAVE CALLED LAND ROVER CORPORATE AND TH
SAT RADIO BETTER ANTENNA
LOCATION OF TOUCH SCREEN IS TOO HIGH ON DASHBOARD
THE RECEPTION FOR THE SIRIUS XM RADIO PORTION IS POOR GET A LOT OF NO SIGNAL INDICATORS THE LIVE TRAFFIC INDICATOR HAS BEEN RESET MORE THAN 3 TIMES ALREADY THE TRAFFIC OR COLLISION ICONS DON T SHOW UP ON THE MAP ITSELF I GET THE COLORED L
1 BLUETOOTH AUDIO TAKES TOO LONG TO CONNECT AND STREAM 2 VOICE SYSTEM IS TOO CHATTY AND LACKS SHORTCUTS LIKE PRESSING DIAL TO DIAL INSTEAD OF THE PAINFUL ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO CALL THE PERSON YOU JUST TOLD ME TO CALL AND YOU SPOKE TOO SOON
THE MULTI FUNCTION NAV AUDIO BACKUP CAMERA ETC CONSOLE SCREEN HAS RELATIVELY LOW RESOLUTION ANGLES UPWARD AND HAS NO PROVISION FOR SHADING IT WASHES OUT COMPLETELY WHEN SUN HITS IT DOESN T SEEM WELL THOUGHT THROUGH
IT COULD BE EASIER TO USE THE NAMES OF THE ARTIST AND THE TITLE OF THE SONG SHOULD BOTH BE DISPLAYED E G SATELLITE CD OR WHATEVER
CONNECTING SMART PHONE VIA USB CABLE SHOULD BE ONE OF THE WAYS TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC
THE FACT THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAS TROUBLE WITH ACCURATELY RECOGNIZING SINGLE NUMBERS I E 1 2 3 MUCH LESS SPOKEN NUMBERS LIKE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX DOES DETRACT FROM A LOT OF THE OTHER GREAT FEATURE THAT HAVE A VOICE R
MAKE PHONE CALLS FROM STEERING WHEEL BY ACCESSING CONTACTS ETC
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SLOW SMALL ANDUSES 10 YEAR OLD TECHNOLOGY AND IS WELL BEHIND THE COMPETITION
IN CONTROL APPS ARE USELESS JUST USING MY IPHONE IS MORE CONVENIENT
THE TOUCH SCREEN ISNT AS SENSITIVE AS IT COULD BE YOU HAVE TO PRESS AND HOLD MOMENTARILY FOR THE DESIRED SELECTION TO TAKE EFFECT
PUT ALL THE SATELLITE CHANNELS IN ONE PLACE SO YOU DON T HAVE TO SWITCH BETWEEN SATELLITE 12 AND THREE IF YOU RE GOING TO OFFER HIGH DEFINITION RADIO MAKE SURE IT IS HIGH DEFINITION ALL THE TIME AND IT DOESN T CUT IN AND OUT OTHERWISE THE SONG
I USE APPLE PRODUCTS AND IN MY OPINION ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT I M USED TO WITH APPLE S IOS IS CUMBERSOME AND ANNOYING TO USE THUS MY LOW ISH ASSESSMENT OF THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION NAV ENTERTAINMENT RANKINGS I D PREFER MY RANGE ROVER TO
SOUND QUALITY WHILE ON THE PHONE
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS A BIT DATED IN APPEARANCE HAS A LAG BETWEEN TOUCH AND SCREEN CHANGE
SUCH A DELAY AFTER EVERY TIME YOU TOUCH THE SCREEN SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW TAKES FOREVER FOR NAV TO START UP
THE NAV SYSTEM IS JUST REALLY DISAPPOINTING THE SCREEN IS NOT SHARP AND I DO NOT BELIEVE IT HAS THE MOST CURRENT MAP UPDATES IN IT
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WITH CONNECTIVITY DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY SO DON T KNOW IF IT WORKS
FIX PROBLEMS WITH OPERATING A SMARTPHONE WHILE PLUGGED INTO USB WHILE ALSO STREAMING AUDIO VIA BLUETOOTH
YOU PUT A $1 000 RADIO IN THE VEHICLE AND IT DOESN T COME STOCK WITH THE UCONNECT FEATURE CANT EVEN STREAM AUDIO FROM MY PHONE TO THE STEREO SHOULD ALSO COME STOCK WITH SATELLITE RADIO
GIVE DIRECTIONS IN MANUAL ABOUT USING SD CARD
I WISH A CD PLAYER WAS STANDARD
BLUETOOTH ISSUES ARE ANNOYING
THE QUALITY OF COMMUNICATION VIA BLUETOOTH
I HAVE ISSUES WITH PEOPLE HEARING MY ON MY BLUETOOTH IT IS OFTEN NOT WORKING SO I HAVE TO SWITCH TO MY PHONE IT IS UNCLEAR
I WOULD RATE THE AUDIO SYSTEM HIGHER IF THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTED WITH MY PHONE REGULARLY
VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE
VOICE QUALITY IN VEHICLE IS POOR
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE COMMANDS AND THERE ARE TOO MANY PROMPTS
DON T REALLY LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN
WOULD LIKE ALBUM ART DISPLAYED WHEN PLAYING VIA BLUETOOTH ALSO DRIVER INFO SCREEN COULD BE UTILIZED MORE WITH FEATURES
IT WOULD BE EASIER TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IF YOU COULD ACTUALLY TYPE IN THE NAME OF EACH CITY AND STREET CURRENTLY YOU TYPE IN THE FIRST FEW LETTERS AND THE COMPUTER FINDS WHAT IT THINKS YOU WANT AND GIVES YOU A FEW CHOICES I WANT TO BE
MY WIFE AND I ARE IN OUR 70 S AND REALLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO USE ANY OF THESE NEW GADGETS
LETTING THE PASSENGER UPDATE THE NAVIGATION WHILE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION WOULD BE HELPFUL
DISPLAY COULD BE BETTER MONOCHROMATIC ORANGE LONG FILE NAMES FROM MY USB COULD SCROLL ALTHOUGH I MAY NOT HAVE THE SETTINGS SET UP RIGHT HAVEN T HAD MUCH OF A CHANCE TO PLAY WITH IT COULD REMEMBER MORE IF I USE THE SYSTEM TO CALL LET S S
SOMETIMES BLUETOOTH HAS TROUBLE CONNECTING A DEVICE TO PLAY AUDIO FROM
COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY TO ANDROID BASED PHONES
DO NOT WANT TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS TOUCH SCREEN IS TOO SENSITIVE TO TOUCH CAN NOT CONCENTRATE ON DRIVING AND USE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY TO BUSY
TWO THINGS AUDIO CONSOLE WOULD BE NICE IF IT WERE TILTED TOWARDS THE DRIVER FOR EASIER USE AND VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY WHEN TOP IS DOWN THE SOUND FROM SPEAKERS ISN T THE BEST BUT I SUPPOSE NO ONE BUYS A JEEP FOR ACOUSTICS
LABELING OF THE OPTIONS IS SOMEWHAT NON INTUITIVE FOR EXAMPLE TO FIND THE ALL STATIONS OPTION FOR THE SATELLITE RADIO SOME HUNTING IS REQUIRED THEN ONCE FOUND I HAVE TO USE THE ARROWS TO SEARCH FOR WHAT I WANT CONSIDER ADDING IN A FEATURE
NAV ROUTE GUIDANCE IS NOT ALWAYS ON TARGET TIME TO DESTINATION ESTIMATE NOT VERY ACCURATE BACKUPS CLOSURES OFTEN NOT IDENTIFIED AND THE STORED SYSTEM ON AN SD CARD IS NOT NEARLY AS EFFECTIVE AS USING AN APPLICATION LIKE WAZE
THIS IS MY SECOND LEXUS ES AS I WAS VERY HAPPY WITH MY FIRST ONE I ONLY RECENTLY ENCOUNTERED A PROBLEM WITH THE NAVIGATION OFFERING THE BEST POSSIBLE DIRECT ROUTE I WILL BE TAKING IN TO A LEXUS DEALER SOON AT MY NEXT MAINTENANCE TO HAVE THIS CHE
PUT IN BOSE SYSTEM MY MAZDA HAD IT AND I PAID $10K MORE FOR THE LEXUS WHICH SHOULD HAVE TOP OF THE LINE SPEAKERS ETC
MOVE PHONE NUMBERS TO DIFFERENT PLACES ON CONTACT LIST
INPUT INTO NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY CLUNKY SOMETHING OUT OF 1990 THE POINT AND CLICK LETTER BY LETTER IS MADDENING THE CAR IS EXCEPTIONAL IN ALL REGARS EXCEPT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM INPUT
I AM REALLY GLAD TO HAVE IT BUT I DON T COMMUTE LONG DISTANCES SO I AM NOT IN THE CAR LONG ENOUGH TO RELY ON THIS FEATURE BUT WHEN I DO I HAVE SOME FRUSTRATION WITH THE RECOGNITION COMMAND VOICE COMMAND AND FINDING CHANNELS WHEN I WANT TO SWI
VOICE RECOGNITION NOT GOOD IF AIR CONDITIONER IS ON MEDIUM TO HIGH MUST LOWER FAN TO GET VOICE RECOGNITION TO WORK
THE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS DISPLAY IS PREDICTIVE NOT REAL TIME WHICH MISSES MANY TRAFFIC PROBLEMS ON THE WEEKENDS I HAVE TO USE TRAFFIC APPS ON MY SMART PHONE FOR TRUE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS
SOUND QUALITY IS WORSE THAN MY ES 350 AND SOUND SETTINGS ARE NOT INTUITIVE EASY TO FIND OR EASY TO ADJUST
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HORRID
NAVIGATION SYSTEM OUTDATED ROUTES
SUPPORT FOR WINDOWS PHONE BETTER STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS FOR USB BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION
NAV SYSTEM IS SOMETIMES CONFUSING
ENTERING ADDRESSES
THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT ALWAYS GET IT ON THE FIRST OR SECOND TRY COMPOSING A TEXT MESSAGE VIA THE VOICE RECOGNITION RARELY WORKS AS IT GETS EVERYTHING WRONG
NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS AREN T SPECIFIC ENOUGH AND TRAFFIC ON MAPS IS NEVER CURRENT
MAKE IT EASIER TO JUST TURN ON THE FM RADIO
AWFUL UI COULD BE EASIER TO NAVIGATE EASE OF USE AND LOOK
VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR BOTH IN ENGLISH USED BY MY AMERICAN HUSBAND AND FRENCH USED BY ME
THE TRAFFIC APP JUST DOESNT WORK I AM SITTING IN DEAD STOP TRAFFIC AND THE TRAFFIC APP SAYS GREEN
SPECIFICALLY A LITTLE MORE POWER AND BASS WITH THE LEXUS PREMIUM AUDIO SYSTEM WOULD BE SWEET
VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR
AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED PANDORA AND SOMETIMES OTHER FACTORY INSTALLED APPS SUCH AS STOCK PRICES AND SPORTS SCORES AND BLUETOOTH MUSIC REPLAY DO NOT WORK PROPERLY PERHAPS BECAUSE OF CONNECTIVITY ISSUES IT WOULD BE GOOD IF LEXUS COULD WORK ON TH
BETTER NAVIGATION SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I OFTEN USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT I HAVEN T YET CAUGHT ON TO USING THE VOICE ACTIVATED SYSTEM SO SOMEHOW THE INTERFACE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
WHEN USING VOICE TO MAKE A PHONE CALL THE SYSTEM GIVES FOUR OR FIVE NAMES EVEN THOUGH IT ACKNOWLEDGES THE SPOKE NAME ANNOYING FEATURE
BETTER CD PLAYER
THE VOLUME LEVEL CHANGES BASED ON SOURCE OF MUSIC WHEN SWITCHING FROM FM TO SAT I HAVE TO RAISE VOLUME LEVEL TO GET SIMILAR LEVEL OF SOUND
IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE THE CONTROLS ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN WHILE DRIVING
THE BUILT IN VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
HARD TO GET DUAL SCREENS CAN T FIGURE IT OUT AND I AM A TECHNIE SHOULD BE A EASY WAY TO KILL THE NAV ONCE IT IT STARTED AND THERE IS NOT
ABILITY TO RETURN TO A MAIN SCREEN WITH MAP AND RADIO STATIONS DISPLAYED IF I USE THE MAIN MENU OR MOVE TO A DIFFERENT SCREEN I HAVE DIFFICULTY RETURNING TO THE MAIN SCREEN AND GET FRUSTRATED ALSO NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT ALWAYS
NOT EASY TO CHANGE RADIO STATION FROM  1 TO  6 WHILE DRIVING NO BUTTONS FOR PRESET STATIONS
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK WITH MY VOICE PATTERN
THE PROCESS OF ENTERING A DESTINATION ADDRESS IS TOO COMPLICATED IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER IF HAD TOUCH SCREEN BUTTONS OR A TRACK PAD TO ENTER THE ADDRESSES
ITS HARD TO CONNECT TO FACEBOOK PANDORA I HAVE TO ACTIVATE MY PHONE TO DO IT SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN HOT SPOT
PHONE VOICE RECOGNITION IS WEAK I ALSO OWN A GM CAR AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS SUPERIOR TO THE LEXUS
THE TRAFFIC UPDATES ON ROUTES OF EXPRESSWAYS HIGHWAYS ETC IS NOT IN REAL TIME THE DELAY CAUSES YOU TO END UP IN TRAFFIC WHICH YOU WOULD WANT TO AVOID
CHANGING RADIO STATIONS REQUIRES MORE THAN ONE TOUCH BUTTON SCREEN ACTION WHICH CAN BE DISTRACTING WHEN DRIVING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE MOST OF THE TIME I GIVE UP ON IT AND A FEW TIMES IT S TOTALLY FAILED ME IN PROVIDING AN
CLARITY OF PHONE CALLS
RADIO STATION SELECTION IS CONFUSING
I GET A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK IN MUSIC WHEN I USE MY PHONE THRU BLUETOOTH
CAN ONLY ELECT FROM THREE ROUTES GENERATED BY THE COMPUTER CANNOT MODIFY A SELECTED ROUTE FOR E G A ROAD BLOCK WITHOUT BLOCKING THE ROAD FIRST ALSO CANNOT MODIFY THE ROUTE IF IT DOES NOT SELECT THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY
COULD DO THINGS LIKE PREVIOUS DESTINATIONS AND NOT JUST GIVE ME 5 CHOICES ON A VERBAL COMMAND THEN WHEN I TOGGLE TO THE SCREEN I GET ALL THE PREVIOUS DESTINATIONS
MENU PROMPTS SIMPLER & VOICE RECOGNITION BETTER
LIKE OPTION OF TOUCH SCREEN
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD NOT KICK IN WHEN I START OUT FROM MY DRIVE WAY AND I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO USE IT WHILE DRIVING ALSO ON A FEW OCCASIONS IT SORT OF FREEZES UP MIDWAY DURING MY INPUT AND I ACTUALLY HAVE TO USE MY EXTERNAL TOMTOM OR PHONE T
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLEX SO MANY THINGS THAT YOU WILL USE ONLY ON OCCASION SO YOU FORGET HOW THEY WORK WHEN YOU NEED THEM
YOUTUBE APPLICATION WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE
IT IS HARD TO USE WITH THE LITTLE MOUSE SOMETIMES I CAN ACCESS CERTAIN THINGS AND OTHER TIMES NOT COMPLETELY UNABLE TO CONNECT A SMARTPHONE AND WHNYOU DO IT DOES NOT STAY CONNECTED JUST OVERALL NOT A GOOD SYSTEM PREFER BMW
NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION OFTEN DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY
REAL TIME TRAFFIC INFORMATION IS NOT ACCURATE
I THINK THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM SHOULD BE IMPROVED BECAUSE IT ALWAYS HAVE A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING MY COMMANDS
THE NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM ALMOST NEVER RECOGNIZES WHAT I ASK OF IT FRUSTRATING
THE NAVIGATION TOGGLE IS INCONVENIENT TO USE I OFTEN GET FRUSTRATED AND USE MY PERSONAL PHONE FOR NAVIGATION ALSO SOMETIMES WHEN ATTEMPTING TO INPUT AN ADDRESS THE OPTION TO SELECT PERSONAL ADDRESS GING UNAVAILABLE VERY OFTEN
INTERNET APPS ARE TOO HARD TO USE
VOICE RECOGNITION IT DOESN T ALWAYS WORKS IT KEEPS ASKING FOR THINGS
NAVI SYSTEM SHOULD BE PROGRAMED WITH WAZE FOR ACCURATE TRAFFIC UPDATES AND ROUTING JOYSTICK CONTROLS ARE NOT GREAT DIFFICULT TO GET RADIO TO APPEAR ON SCREEN
NOT SURE IF IT IS THE PHONE OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM BUT IT HAS A HARD TIME CONNECTING TO THE BLUETOOTH WHICH IS WHY I DO NOT USE AS OFTEN AS I WOULD
VOICE RECOGNITION IS DIFFICULT
VOICE DOESN T RECOGNIZE CORRECTLY DON T LIKE MOUSE THINGS NOT EASILY ON SCREEN TO NAVIGATE
INTUITIVE CONTROLS  SEE GARMIN IPHONE ETC
THE VOICE COMMANDS FOR NAV ARE NOT THE MOST INTUITIVE FINDING POI S ALONG MY ROUTE IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE
SIMPLIFY VOICE COMMANDS REDUCE CAR TALKING BACK TO ME
NON WORKING BLUETOOTH SINCE DAY 1
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WITH MOBILE DEVICES IS NOT VERY EASY TO USE
E DESTINATION FEATURE WILL NOT ALLOW SCROLLING ENTIRE FOLDER FOLDER HOLDS 10 LOCATIONS AND ONLY 5 CAN BE SEEN OR SELECTED WHILE CAR IS MOVING MUST STOP VEHICLE TO SEE THE REMAINDER OF THE LOCATIONS WAS TOLD SAFETY CONCERN
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS FINE THERE IS JUST A LEARNING CURVE TO OPERATE IT
NAV IS FINE THE MUSIC IS TOO CONFUSING I LISTEN TO 2 OR 3 CHANNELS AND SOME TALK RADIO I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO FIND IT WITH OUT JUST SCROLLING
SOMETIMES THE VOICE COMMANDS ARE INACCURATE IF THE COOLING SYSTEM IS BLOWING HARD BECAUSE THE FAN BLOWER SEEMS TO INTERFERE WITH THE ABILITY TO DIAGNOSE VOICE COMMANDS
CLEARER INSTRUCTION ON OBTAINING DESIRED SCREEN IMAGE AND VOICE ACTIVATION RECOGNITION OF VOICE COMMANDS
SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLICATED TOUCH SCREENS ARE MUCH EASIER
NAV SYSTEM IS THE PROBLEM
AUDIO GREAT COMMUNICATION NAV SYSTEMS ARE VERY DIFFICULT NOT USER FRIENDLY ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE INCH THICK MANUALS I LIKE THE NAV ROUTE IDEA BUT I M SORRY I PURCHASED THE NAVIGATION PKG
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED WITH BETTER SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
WHEN USING SATELITE RADIO WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE OPTION TO PAUSE OR REPLAY A SONG
THE CONTROL BUTTON IS VERY CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT TO USE ACCURATELY THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE NOT CONSISTENT IN THEIR OPERATION DOING MUCH WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY TO CHANGE CHANNELS WITH VOICE COMMANDS IS NEXT TO
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NEARLY UNUSABLE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO SHOW TRAFFIC CONDITIONS ON THE MAP USING DIFFERENT COLORS FOR CONGESTED ROADWAYS IE YELLOW RED AND GREEN
SOUND QUALITY OF CALLS
NAVIGATION IS NOT ACCURATE AT TIMES EVEN THOUGH IT IS A NEW CAR
WOULD LIKE THE AUDIO SOUND TO BE DIMINISHED WHEN NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS ARE BEING ANNOUNCED
THE RADIO CHANNELS NEED TO BE IN THE VOICE RECOGNITION
THE TOUCH PAD TO CONTROL EVERYTHING IS TOO SENSITIVE ANDHAS TO BE VERY PRECISE TO GET EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT MOST TIMES I USE THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL IF POSSIBLE BECAUSE I FIND THEM MUCH EASIER TO USE ALTHOUGHT YOU CAN T USE THEM FOR
SCREEN IS BUSY NOT AS LARGE AS OUR ACURA AND THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS CLUTTERED WITH ICONS I D LIKE TO SEE A LESS BUSY SCREEN
IMPROVE VOICE ACTIVATION IT MISINTERPRETS ME OFTEN
VOICE RECOGNITION ASSOCIATED WITH NAVIGATION IN PARTICULAR IN UNDERSTANDING ADDRESSES IS VERY POOR
ELIMINATE THE CANNOT INPUT AN ADDRESS ON THE NAVIGATION WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION SAFETY ISSUE FOR THE DRIVER HOWEVER THE PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO INPUT THE ADDRESS WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS TO HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING NAMES
FIX THE IDIOSYNCRASIES OF THE CAR CONNECTING TO THE IPHONE TO PLAY PANDORA AND BE ABLE TO PLAY PANDORA WHILE CHARGING IPHONE IN CAR
SHOULD HAVE TOUCH SCREEN ON THE DISPLAY THE MOUSE TYPE SYSTEM IS VERY HARD TO USE
IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION
ENTERING A DESTINATION THROUGH THE MANUAL OPERATION I E THE TOUCH CONTROL MOUSE PAD IS FRUSTRATING SLOW CUMBERSOME AND A REAL STEP BACK FOR LEXUS
VOICE RECOGNITION POOR
SOUND SYSTEM QUALITY BELOW EXPECTATIONS FOR THIS PRICE POINT VOICE COMMAND FOR PHONE RADIO DOES NOT RECOGNIZE MANY COMMANDS MUST REPEAT MANY TIMES
DIFFICULT TO OPERATE THE TOUCH PAD TO SELECT THE ITEM NEEDED PREFER THE MOUSE
WHEN CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH THE SOUND QUALITY IS DISTORTED SLIGHTLY ESPECIALLY WITH 3RD PARTY APPS LIKES SPOTIFY
DISPLAY SHOULD SHOW WHAT THE PRESETS ARE TUNED TO
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION LOOK AT THE QUALITY OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION FROM GOOGLE IT IS EXCELLENT ALSO THE TOUCH PAD COULD BE IMPROVED
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT EASY TO USE HARD TO SET DESTINATION
VOICE COMMANDS HAVE FAR TOO MANY VOICE STEPS AND CONFIRMATIONS TO BE EFFECTIVE FOUND MANY MISTAKEN RECOGNITIONS OF COMMANDS MUCH FASTER TO USE TOUCH CONTROL
LOSE THE TOUCH PAD BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION SIMPLIFIED MENUS
BLUETOOTH RINGING IS TOO LOUD
I DIDN T HAVE A CHANCE TO LISTEN TO A MARK LEVINSON STEREO SYSTEM IN A VEHICLE AS NONE WERE IN STOCK I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE MORE POWER CLEAR VOLUME FROM THE STEREO AND WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THE UPGRADE BUT IT IS A PRICEY OPTION TO CHOOSE WITH
I THINK THAT THE REGULAR AUDIO SYSTEM IS NOT OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY THE OPTION MARK LEVINSON WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HOWEVER IT IS NOT IMPORTANT FOR ME SINCE I USUALLY PREFER HEARING THE SOUND OF THE ENGINE
WHY CAN T YOU SAY FAVORITES AND THEN PICK A DESTINATION FROM YOUR FAVORITES ALL VIA VOICE CONTROL  THE WORD FAVORITES IS NOT RECOGNIZED
VERBAL COMMANDS SHOULD BE BETTER
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS UNACCEPTABLE
VOICE RECOGNITION ON NAVIGATION
TOUCH PAD VERY SENSETIVE LESS JERKY
EASIER USE OF VOICE COMMANDS BETTER RECOGNITION OF COMMANDS LEARNING CURVE LONG
NAVIGATION DIFFICULT TO USE TOO PARTICULAR FOR COMMANDS PASSENGER CANNOT USE SCREEN WHILE DRIVING VERSUS VOICE RECOGNITION
TALK WITH AN OPERATOR LIKE ONSTAR
NEEDS TO BE GOOGLE BASED OPERATING SYSTEM
BLUETOOTH NOT WORKING VOICE NAV DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
SWITCH TO TOUCH SCREEN BASED SYSTEM A TRACK PAD IS JUST NOT INTUITIVE OR EASY TO USE
USE MAINSTREAM PROGRAMS LIKE GOOGLE MAPS USE MORE SIMPLE MENU ITEMS LIKE APPLE
THE CURRENT SYSTEM TO ESTABLISH A NEW DESTINATION IS VERY TIME CONSUMING AND REQUIRES THE USE OF THE ONBOARD CURSER SYSTEM INSTEAD OF EITHER VOICE OR TOUCH SCREEN
I JUST A HARD TIME WITH THE SYSTEM UNDERSTANDING MY VOICE COMMANDS MAYBE IT S MY BOSTON ACCENT
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
WAY TOO MANY PROMPTS AND COMMANDS TO ENTER A DESTINATION ADDRESS
DON T LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN
BETTER CONNECTIVITY WITH CELL PHONE
EASE OF ENTERING ADDRESSES INTO NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT IS MUCH EASIER TO USE GOOGLE MAPS ON IPHONE
THE USER EXPERIENCE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT SPECIFICALLY THE TIMING OF SWITCHING FROM BACK UP CAMERA TO THE NEW WARNING SCREEN AND THEN FINALLY TO THE ON SCREEN MENU THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW IN LOADING AND SWITCHING SCRE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT GREAT AND THE SOFTWARE IS A LITTLE BIT SLOW TO RESPOND AFTER PRESSING BUTTONS
IT IS NOT EASY TO USE AS IN OTHER VEHICLES IT REQUIRES THE USE OF A SMALL MOUSE LIKE CONTROLLER TO NAVIGATE THOUGH DIFFERENT MENUES TO SELECT BETWEEN PHONE CONTROLS NAVIGATION MUSIC ETC WHICH IS NOT EASY TO DO DURING DRIVING NOR IS IT VERY I
THE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT DEFAULT TO MAP THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS HORRIBLE THE CHANNEL SELECTION PAGE AND AUDIO FORMAT WAS MUCH BETTER ON OLDER 2102 MODEL
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT GOOD AND HARD TO GET OUT OF THE LOOP
THE APP FOR IPHONE IS VERY OUTDATED AND IS NOT ENJOYABLE TO USE FOR AS MUCH TECHNOLOGY AS EXISTS ON THIS CAR THE IOS APP BRINGS THAT EXPERIENCE DOWN
THE ON SCREEN CONTROLS ARE TEDIOUS TO USE EVEN WITH THE MOUSE TYPE INTERFACE
MORE DETAILED NICER MAP DISPLAYS LESS DELAY WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN SCREENS
NOT INTUITIVE COMMANDS VERY HARD TO USE PANDORA YELP NEVER WORKS TAKES TOO LONG TO TAKE COMMANDS MISINTERPRETS AND DOESN T GONE ENOUGH TIME FOR ADDRESSES
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CLICKS INTERACTIONS WITH THE MAP JUST TO DELETE A DESTINATION ON THE MAP TAKES 4 5 CLICKS
THEY LET THE JAPANESE PROGRAM CELL PHONE NAMES AND NUMBERS ARE LOADED AND ALPHATABETIZED BY FIRST NAMES MAKING IT HARD TOLOCATE PEOPLE DOES T ALLOW YOU TO CHANGE
I WISH IT WOULD RECOGNIZE MY VOICE COMMANDS TO CHOOSE MUSIC SELECTION OR MAKE PHONE CALLS
WHY CANT PANDORA APP AND OTHER APPS BE ON THE VEHICLE WITHOUT USING MY OWN PHONE
IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO STORE NAVIGATION LOCATIONS AND TO PULL THEM UP
NAVIGATION CAN BE MORE INTUITIVE
IT IS NOT USER FRIENDLY HAVING TO FIGURE OUT THE NAV SYSTEM AND I PHONE INTERFACE I KNOW MY CAR DOES A LOT MORE THAN I THINK IT DOES BUT I DON T HAVE TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT
SHOULD BE A SETTING THAT HAVE YOUR PRESETS ALWAYS BE THE DEFAULT ON BOTH THE INSTRUMENT PANEL OR THE CENTER CONSOLE DISPLAY WHEN I START THE CAR IT ALWAYS DEFAULTS TO WHATEVER WAS LISTENING TO LAST SO IF I WAS IN MY PRESET SECTION AND HAVE BO
I FIND THE RADIO CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE I DON T LIKE SCROLLING THROUGH THE RADIO STATIONS AND I FEEL THAT IT REQUIRES ME TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD MORE THAN IS SAFE
VOICE COMMAND IS NOT AVAILABLE BUT I WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE FEATURES WHEN I ORDERED THE CAR
THE EASE OF USING VOICE RECOGNITION
I DID NOT BUY THE NAVIGATION FEATURE AND THEREFORE DO NOT HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION ON OTHER AUDI CARS YOU CAN HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION WITHOUT PURCHASING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE SALES PERSON WAS NOT AWARE THIS FUNCTION DID NOT WORK WITHOUT THE N
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND EASE OF ENTERING INFORMATION ADDRESSES COULD BE IMPROVED
THE NAVIGATION COULD ACTUALLY WORK
THE AUDI Q3 NEEDS A USB PORT IT HAS TWO SD CARD PORTS I AM NOT SURE WHO USES SD CARDS ANYMORE
THE IN CAR APPS ARE TERRIBLE THEY DON T ALWAYS WORK AND INTERNET CONNECTION IS HIT OR MISS
HAVING TO USE A RADIAL BUTTON IS VERY ARCHAIC TO SELECT MENUS ON THE SCREENS TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE EASIER WHILE DRIVING AND DEFINITELY A LOT FASTER
YOU SHOULD BE USING GOOGLE MAPS WITH ITS TRAFFIC INFO WHAT YOU DO CANNOT COMPARE TO ITS QUALITY
NAV IS NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY MANY TIMES THE SYSTEM CANNOT FIND WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR
ACCURACY OF VOICE COMMANDS AND EASE OF USE
WHEN CONNECTING MY IPOD VIA EITHER BLUETOOTH OR USB IT IS CUMBERSOME TO FIND PLAYLISTS OR ARTISTS
BETTER SPEAKERS BETTER PLACEMENT BETTER IN STEERING CONTROLS
MAKING SATALITE RADIO EASIER TO USE MORE INTUITIVE
DISAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF AVAILABLE FEATURES WHEN USING THE IPHONE SEEMS LIKE THE CONNECTED FEATURES WORK MOST FOR BLACKBERRY WHICH NOBODY USES
POI NAVIGATION LESS COMPLICATED
THE NAVIGATION MENU IS HARD TO NAVIGATE
THE NAVIGATION DOESN T ALWAYS WORK AS EXPECTED FOR EXAMPLE MY DESTINATION WILL BE 1000 AHEAD ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STREET AND THE NAVIGATION WILL TELL ME TO TURN RIGHT AND CIRCLE AROUND THE BLOCK
LIKE A TOUCH SCREEN AND AIRPORTS AND OTHER INFORMATION IN LIST SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN INTERNET
I DO NOT USE MOST OF THESE FEATURES AND WISH I DID NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM I ONLY USE THE RADIO AND CD
MORE INTUITIVE VOICE RECOGNITION
I WISH IT CAME WITH SIRIUS RADIO
SPEAKER QUALITY ALREADY MENTIONED AN UPGRADE WOULD BE EASY AND NEED NOT BE THE EQUAL TO THE BOSE OPTION
ONCE PHONE APPS ARE LOADED THE PHONE IS NOT REQUIRED TO OPERATE THEM WHEN THE IPHONE RINGS OR GETS A TEXT MESSAGE THE PHONE APP RUNNING IN THE CAR SHUTS OFF AND HAS TO BE HAND RESTARTED TO GET BACK ON INTERNET RADIO FOR EXAMPLE
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION FOR ENTERING NEW ROUTE
MY LAST BMW 528I CAME WITH SIRIUS XM THIS ONE DOES NOT AND I WISH THAT IT DID I USED THAT ALL THE TIME
VOICE RECOGNITION POINTS OF INTEREST BETTER MANUAL OR VIDEO TUTORIAL ON HOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FEATURES
SOUND QUALITY FROM BASE SPEAKERS IS RATHER POOR SIRIUS SATELLITE SERVICE QUALITY IS VERY POOR RECOGNIZE THIS IS A SIRIUS ISSUE NOT BMW
VOICE RECOGNITION CONTROL FEATURE
VOICE COMMAND JUST OK GOOGLE MAPS IS BETTER SOMETIMES TAKES ME TO THE CORRECT GENERAL LOCATION BUT CORRECT SPOT E G SIDE ROAD NOT CONNECTED TO MALL BUT CLOSE TO MALL
THE SOUND WHEN I PUT MY MUSIC ON BLUETOOTH DOES NOT SOUND AS LOUD AS THE RADIO
VOICE COMMANDS ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE
TRAFFIC INFORMATION IS USUALLY WRONG I HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO THE WRONG ADDRESS SEVERAL TIMES BY NAVIGATION
AUDIO SYSTEM SPEAKERS COULD USE MORE POWER
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T UNDERSTAND ME VERY WELL THOUGH MY ACCENT IS CRYSTAL CLEAR
LISTING THE STEPS OF THE NAVIGATION ROUTE LIKE MAPS DOES ON AN IPHONE SO YOU CAN SEE THE ENTIRE ROUTE LISTED OUT IN A SEQUENCE ROAD BY ROAD FOR THE ENTIRE TRIP
WOULD LIKE TO USE PHONE APPS FOR TRAFFIC NAVIGATION OR HAVE REAL TIME TRAFFIC INFORMATION WITH RE ROUTING CAPABILITIES
GREAT SOUND SYSTEM NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE WITHOUT STREET ADDRESS USING CATEGORY SEARCH OR POINTS OF INTEREST SEARCH RETURN LOCATIONS THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY INSTEAD OF LOCAL SITES SHOULD GIVE UP ON THIS AND BUY   LEVERAGE GO
NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY TO MY IPHONE MUSIC IT S VERY SLOW AND HARD TO NAVIGATE
MOSTLY VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT WORKING HAVE TO USE PANEL TO CONTROL IT
HAVE IPHONE PAIR INDEPENDENTLY FROM USB UPDATE YOUR SOFTWARE ASAP
PHONE ECHOS INSIDE THE VEHICLE WHEN USING BLUETOOTH
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A BIG IMPROVEMENT OVER PREVIOUS MODEL THE LAYOUT COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE
IDRIVE IS INITIALLY CONFUSING AND HAS TOO MANY OPTIONS
EASE OF VOICE COMMANDS
TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY FOR ME SORRY I REALIZE MANY PEOPLE WOULD LOVE ALL THE GADGETS BUT I FIND IT ANNOYING TO TRY TO FIGURE EVERYTHING OUT BEFORE I USE IT ALSO CAN T CONTROL IPOD FROM COLUMN STEERING HAVE TO USE THE ACTUAL PHONE WHICH THEN
EVEN WITHOUT NAVIGATION VOICE ACTIVATION SHOULD BE AN OPTION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM USES OUTDATED MAPS IT SHOULD BE AT LEAST AS GOOD AS GOOGLE MAPS BUT ISN T NEARLY AS UP TO DATE I VE HAD THE SAME ISSUE WITH ALL IN CAR NAVIGATION SYSTEMS INCLUDING BMW GMC MERCEDES BENZ CAN T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CAN T FI
NAVIGATION DATABASE LACKS COVERAGE OF MANY URBAN STREETS AND DESTINATIONS AND NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO FIND A STREET NUMBER WITHOUT HAVING TO PROVIDE THE ZIP CODE FOR STREETS TRAVERSING MULTIPLE ZIP CODES
ABILITY TO SEND AND RECEIVE TEXTS THROUGH SYSTEM RATHER THAN THROUGH THE IPHONE ITSELF
THE MAP PART IS REALLY HARD TO USE TO HAVE TO TYPE IN THE DESTINATION IS CUMBERSOME
USE GOOGLE MAPS DO NOT USE THE NAVIGATION USE MY PHONE AND GOOGLE MAPS EASIER TO USE AND RELIABLY HAS EVERYTHING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PROGRAM A SIMPLE DIRECTION AT TIMES ONE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE A DEGREE OR BE A RACKET SCIENTIST TO DO SO
SCANNING THRU RADIO CHANNELS SOMEWHAT CUMBERSOME ASSIGNING RADIO CHANNELS A BIT COMPLICATED USB PORT DOES NOT EASILY READ MUSIC
CONNECTING IPHONE COULD BE A LOT EASIER AND MORE RELIABLE COULD BE BMW OR APPLE NOT SURE WHICH MAKES IT UNRELIABLE I LIKE THAT IT STORES CD S IN THE SYSTEM MAKES IT EASIER FINDING ITEMS ON CONNECTED DEVICE COULD BE EASIER THE 3 SERIES I
CONTACT LIST SHOULD BE STAND ALONE AND NOT TIED TO THE BLUETOOTH DEVICE
SOME OF THE CONNECTED APPS AREN T INTEGRATED AS WELL AS COULD BE PARTICULARLY SPOTIFY I CAN T SEARCH IN THE APP ALSO VOICE CONTROLS COULD BE MORE NATURAL
I AM NOT VERY TECH SAVVY AND HAVE NOT HAD MUCH TIME TO SIT DOWN AND STUDY THE USE OF THE FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE I KNOW FROM HAVING 2 MERCEDES SUVS IN THE PAST THAT THIS IS A MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY SYSTEM SO I WOULD CHALK IT UP TO USER INEXPERIENCE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A LOT HARDER TO USE THAN MY IPHONE MAPS I DON T REALLY USE THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION BECAUSE IT TAKES MUCH LONGER AND I OBVIOUSLY CANNOT OPERATE IT WHILE DRIVING WHEN I JUMP IN THE CAR I WANT TO GET DIRECTIONS AS QUICKLY
DIFFICULT TO CONNECT TO NEW IPHONE 6+ USE HANDS FREE CALLING OUT BUT NOT ON INCOMING CALLS FROM TIME TO TIME
VOICE RECOGNITION AND EASE OF USE
I USE DEEZER ELITE LOSSLESS STREAMING THE FACT THAT IN ORDER TO ACCESS DEEZER IN THE VEHICLE I HAVE TO START THE BMW CONNECT APP ON THE PHONE PLUG THE PHONE IN VIA USB THEN GO THROUGH MULTIPLE MENU LAYERS TO START DEEZER IS CRAZY AND ANNOYI
TOO MANY DRILL DOWNS TO REACH YOUR DESTINATION
A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE GREAT
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE WHICH IS FINE HOWEVER IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GO DOWN WHEN NOT BEING USED
DONT NEED SATELITE RADIO
CONNECTIVITY MANIPULATION AND INTEGRATION OF ALL IPHONE FEATURES INTO THE SYSTEM WHEN THE IPHONE IS PLUGGED INTO THE CAR

THE HARMON KARDON SPEAKERS SOUND TINNY
RADIO STATION CONTROLS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD BE GREAT
AN APP THAT KEEPS US AWAKE WOULD BE GREAT
NAVIGATION THROUGH MUSIC LIBRARY COULD BE IMPROVED IF I NAVIGATE TO A FOLDER SELECT A SONG TO LISTEN TO THERE IS NOT AN EASY WAY TO GO BACK FROM THE SONG TO THE FOLDER IT WAS PLAYED IN BE IT AN ACTUAL FOLDER OR A SUB CATEGORY LIKE ALBUM OR AR
NAVIGATION VOICE COMMAND DOES NOT ALWAYS ACCEPT CORRECT ADDRESS ON INITIAL ATTEMPT

COLORS IN NAVIGATION SATELLITE RADIO CHANNEL SELECTION
THE VOICE COMMAND IS TOO SLOW AND OFTEN DOES NOT RECOGNIZE A COMMAND
AUDI SHOULD JUST BUY GARMIN NAVIGATION NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY

BLUETOOTH AND TEXT EMAIL NOTIFICATION
I NEED A QUICK GUIDE CARD TO REMEMBER WHAT FUNCTIONALITY I HAVE AND HOW TO GET TO IT I VE SPENT SOME TIME EXPLORING THE MENUS BUT I FORGET HOW TO FIND THINGS OR THAT I HAVE THINGS I WISH THE VOICE CONTROLS WERE EASIER TO REMEMBER THE PHONE
STEERING WHEEL RADIO CONTROL TO CHANGE STATIONS
WOULD LIKE TO CONNECT MY IPHONE WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY A SPECIAL CABLE
IMPROVE THE LOCATION OF THE CONTROLS IN CONSOLE AREA WHILE DRIVING THERE IS A TENDENCY TO LOOK DOWN AND MANAGE THE CONTROLS ALSO VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT ALLOW SELECTION OF A CERTAIN TRACK WHEN USING THE IPHONE MEDIA MUSIC SELECTION
THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND NAVIGATION NEED IMPROVEMENT
EASIER NAVIGATION SYSTEM TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE NICE
SOUND QUALITY PROVIDE SURROUND SOUND
PUSHBUTTONS ARE PREFERABLE TO A TOUCHSCREEN BECAUSE TOUCHSCREEN COMMANDS REQUIRE THE DRIVER TO TAKE HIS EYES OFF THE ROAD BRIEFLY
CAPACITANT SWITCHES ARE DIFFICULT TO USE AND REQUIRE REMOVAL OF GLOVE IN WINTER FOR ACTIVATION IT IS GOOD THAT A HEATED STEERING WHEEL IN NOW STANDARD FOR WINTER DRIVING IT IA A PAIN TO TAKE GLOVES OFF AND PUT BACK ON THE USE ANY OF THESE CONT
NEED TO IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
BACK UP CAMERA COULD USE A RED LINE OR BE BRIGHTER
THE NAV SYSTEM IS PROBABLY FINE I M JUST NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH IT AS I COULD BE

TOUCH SCREEN LETTERING IS TOO SMALL CLOCK AND TEMPERATURE ALSO TOO SMALL
TOUCH SCREEN NOT EASY TO READ SO MUCH INFO WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING TO KNOW WHAT TO PUSH

COST OF ONSTAR SHOULD BE LOWERED
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT EASY TO USE RADIO CONTROLS NOT SENSITIVE TO THE TOUCH
SOUND IS BETTER THAN MY LAST REGAL BUT STILL LACKS QUALITY SOUND AND VOLUME NATURAL VOICE RECOGNITION IS OFTEN ERROR FILLED
WAS NOT ABLE TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO ZERO IN ON A PARTICULAR INTERSECTION
INSTRUCTIONS FOR NAVIGATION RADIO AND HANDS FREE PHONES ARE REAL DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHICH IT MAKES UNSAFE TO USE THE VOICE NEVER QUITE UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU SAY

FIX THE WIFI
HAVE NOT USED NAVIGATION BUT YOU DEMAND A ANSWER SOMEONE THERE HAVE A BRAIN FART
FOR ME IT WOULD BE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND DIRECTIONS THEIR TOO CONFUSING FOR TECHNOLOGY IMPAIRED PEOPLE
HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MUCH SINCE WE DON T TRAVEL MUCH IT SEEMS TO BE QUITE COMPLICATED IF YOU DON T USE IT OFTEN
MAKE EASIER TO FIGURE OUT PRE PROGRAMMABLE RADIO STATIONS
SAME COMMENT AS GIVEN EARLIER THEREIS A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT COMES WITH THE VEHICLE THAT I AM ON MY OWN TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE PROPERLY
THE NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE WITH VOICE COMMANDS AND GETTING THE CORRECT STATE AND CITY IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO USE AND CANCEL CURRENT DATA INPUT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR ME IS USELESS DON T HAVE MAP FEATURE POINTS OF INTEREST OR ANYTHING EXCEPT TO CALL THE PEOPLE AND DOWNLOAD DIRECTIONS WHEN I USED TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN AN ADDRESS AND FOLLOW THE MAP IN MY PREVIOUSLY OWNED CTS NOT AN UPGRA
PROVIDE MULTI CD PLAYER AFTER ALL MANY OF US STILL OWN HUNDREDS OF DISCS AND A MULTIPLE DISC PLAYER WOULD BE A GRAND ADDITTION
DEFAULT NAVIGATION
I AM NOT AN ENGINEER I LISTEN MOSTLY TO SPORTS TALK RADIO
WHEN I PRESS THE BUTTON FOR VOICE COMMAND JUST BEEP AND BE READY HAVING TO WAIT EVERY TIME AS IT SPEAKS A FULL SENTENCE PAUSES AND THEN FINALLY BEEPS IS NOT FRIENDLY I ALWAYS END UP STARTING TO SPEAK TOO EARLY IF THERE S A COMMAND TO CANCEL
HAVING THESE ARE CONVENIENT BUT NOT KNOWING OR HARD TO FIGURE OUT PREVENTS US FROM USING THE TOUCH SCREEN MENUS ARE NOT INTUITIVE MANY CLICK THROUGHS IT TOOK ME SEVERAL TIMES TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SET UP FAVORITES ON THE RADIO SAT STATIONS
I DON T LIKE THE CUE SYSTEM S WAY OF SWITCHING FROM AUDIO TO MEDIA CLIMATE
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION IS AWFUL IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND AND THEN HAS LONG INSTRUCTIONS THAT YOU CAN T TALK OVER UNTIL SHE IS DONE EXPLAINING THEN IT SAYS GOODBYE LOL
COMLEXITY OF TOUCH SCREEN
THE CHARGING PAD HAS NEVER WORKED AND COMPATIBILITY ISSUES WITH PANDORA ARE CONFUSING

THE NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE
SLOW TO RESPOND LOSES CONNECTION WITH IPOD CONTROLS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE NOT MUCH TO REALLY LIKE
SIMPLIFY THE INPUT MANUALLY TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I LIKE THE RECEDING MAP ETC DISPLAY
IT NEEDS TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE IT OFTEN TAKES TOO LONG TO RESPOND TO SOME TOUCHES SMARTPHONES SET THE STANDARD FOR RESPONSIVENESS THE TOUCHSCREEN IN A $35 000 CAR SHOULD BE AS RESPONSIVE AS A $600 PHONE
VERY UNHAPPY THAT I DID NOT KNOW THERE WAS NO CD PLAYER EXTREMELY UNHAPPY WOULD NOT HAVE WALKED OUT OF THE DEALERS WITH THE CAR IF I HAD EVEN KNOWN THIS IS AN INCONVENIENCE BECAUSE I LISTEN TO BOOKS ON TAPE DURING MY COMMUTE FELT THAT THIS
NO VIDEO SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION IS A BIG PROBLEM IT IS NOT A PLEASURABLE EXPERIENCE HAVING TO REPEAT MY VOICE COMMANDS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN I EVENTUALLY GIVE UP AND USE THE TOUCHSCREEN
THE NAVIGATION FUNCTION IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE WAZE APP I USE THE PHONE APP INSTEAD OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THERE ARE NO REAL TIME TRAFFIC WORKAROUNDS ONLY VERY BASIC DESTINATION ROUTS INEFFICIENT IN FUNCTIONING WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH BETTER
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS ON USING THE CUE OPTIONS
I USED TO ALWAYS OWN A TOYOTA NEVER HAD AUDIO PROBLEM IT SYNCED WITH MY PHONE AND REMEMBERED EACH TIME I GOT INTO MY CAR NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THIS AUDIO SYSTEM AT ALL
DON T LIKE PAYING EXRTRA FOR ONSTAR SERVICE FORD SYNC SERVICE LINKED THRU MY ALREADY PAID FOR CELL PHONE SERVICE
VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTIONALITY
NOT SURE IF IT ALREADY DOES BUT NAVIGATION SYSTEMS SHOULD UPDATE MORE FREQUENTLY DOES NOT GIVE THE BEST ROUTES IN CITIES LIKE MIAMI
NAV SYSTEM NOT USER FRIENDLY SOME AUDIO CONTROLS NOT AT ALL INTUITIVE
IPHONE CONNECTIVITY IS HORRIBLE
WHEN I ATTEMPT TO STATE A POI IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT ALWAYS GET IT WRONG THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS WAY OUTDATED
FOR SOME REASON I HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING MY VEHICLE TO CONNECT TO AND STAY CONNECTED TO PANDORA ALSO I HAVE PROBLEMS CONNECTING MY IPOD ACCESSING FEATURES ON MY SMARTPHONE AND PLAYING EXTERNAL MEDIA SOURCES
2 THINGS+++++MAKE THE INFO SYSTEM MORE USER FRIENDLY AND EASIER TO HANDLE MAKE THE VOICE RECOGNITION MORE USER FRIENDLY ABLE TO UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WITH ACCENTS LISPSS ETC
HOW TO SET UP TEXT MESSAGES ON THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK EVEN THOUGH SALESMAN SAID IT SHOULD WORK
THE CUE SYSTEM IS NOT EASY TO USE
ENHANCE NAVIGATION CURRENT SYSTEM DOES NOT APPROACH THE LOWER END GARMIN HAND HELD UNITS
NAVI IS DIFFICULT TO LOAD TAGGED DESTINATIONS
WHEN BLUETOOTH IS CONNECTED CANNOT GET AUDIO COMMANDS FOR OTHER SYSTEMS TO WORK

NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO PROGRAM PERHAPS AN EASIER SET UP SYSTEM COULD BE DEVELOPED
THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD REVIEW ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH ONSTAR AND DEMAND IMPROVEMENTS ONSTAR HAS BECOME EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE IN RECENT MONTHS A CHANGE FROM ITS PREVIOUS HIGH STANDARD OF CUSTOMER SERVICE IT NOW TAKES FOREVER TO GET A CALL ANSWERE
INACCURATE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT READ TEXT MESSAGING ALTHOUGH IT INDICATES BLUETOOTH DEVICE IS CONNECTED ALWAYS SAYING MESSAGE NO TEXT MESSAGES FOUND CONTROL OF DVD IS FROM REAR REMOTE ONLY WHICH IS TAKES DRIVER OUT OF IT POSITIVE SAFETY
CD PLAYER COULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNED IN A MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE LOCATION INSTEAD OF INSIDE THE GLOVE BOX
I HATE CUE
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO CHANGE STATIONS
THE HANDS FREE TELEPHONE HAS VERY POOR CLARITY
STORING PREVIOUS DESTINATIONS WOULD HAVE PREFERRED KNOBS SWITCHES AND PRESETS TO TOUCH SCREEN WHICH I FIND IRRITATING TO USE CUE IS NOT USER FRIENDLY PRACTICALLY REQUIRES YOU TO HAVE A CO PILOT TO OPERATE SHOULDN T BE USED WHILE DRIVING
ADJUSTING THE VOLUME OF THE AUDIO IS DIFFICULT THE TOUCH SCREEN DOESN T ALWAYS RESPOND
USB CONNECTION CUE IS SLUGGISH TO CHANGE SONGS HAVE TO PLAY ON MY PHONE FOR MUSIC TO START EACH TIME I START MY CAR VOICE RECOGNITION LOTS OF COMMANDS SLOW
VOICE RECOGNITION RELATED TO NAVIGATION THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T RECOGNIZE MOST PLACES SO WE END UP TYPING IN THE DETAILS
AS BEFORE TOUGH SCREEN HAD WEIRD CLICK FEEL THAT ISN T CONSISTENT NAV IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND VOICE RECOGNITION IS REALLY SLOW
THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM FOR THE DVD PLAYER SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE
THE DISPLAY AND RENDERING OF THE MAP ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN ALONG WITH THE ACCURACY OF THE ROUTE COULD BE IMPROVED THE DISPLAY SHOULD LOOK MORE LIKE WHAT A DISPLAY IN A BMW OR MERCEDES LOOKS LIKE SINCE THE PRICE FOR THE VEHICLE IS COMPARABLE
OUR PLUG IN NAVIGATION DEVICE SHOWS US THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT AND THE SPEED AT WHICH I AM DRIVING THE CURRENT BUILT IN ONE ON THE VEHICLE DOES NOT IT S NICE TO KNOW HOW FAST YOU SHOULD BE GOING WHEN YOU ARE DRIVING IN NEW AREAS WHERE THE SPEED
NEEDS CD PLAYER
MY LS MODEL DOES NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR MY IPHONE MUSIC I HAVE TO USE A CORD TO PLAY MUSIC FROM MY PHONE OK BUT THE DEALERSHIP TOLD ME IT WOULD PLAY WITH BLUETOOTH LIKE MY PHONE CALLS THE PHONE CALL BLUETOOTH IS GREAT
VOICE COMMANDS OFTEN REQUIRE MULTIPLE ATTEMPT TO GET DESIRED OUTCOME
HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO BLUETOOTH MUSIC FROM MY PHONE YET
NAVIGATION DISPLAYING SPEED LIMITS OF CURRENT ROAD BEING TRAVELED NOTIFICATION OF UPCOMING ACCIDENT IF AVAILABLE
HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THE DVD PLAYER AND THE OPERATION GM HAS GONE TO FAR WITH THE TECHNOLOGY OF THESE NEW CARS I DON T BELIEVE IT IS SAFE TO HAVE ALL THIS STUFF I FIND MYSELF LOOKING AT THE CONTROLS RATHER THAN THE ROAD
THE AUDIO SCREEN SEEMS LOW TECH
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IN MY NISSAN ALTIMA WAS WORLDS BETTER THAN THAT OF THE CAMARO WHICH NEEDLESS TO SAY IS DISAPPOINTING THE CARS ONLY SAVING GRACE IS THE EXHAUST NOTE MAKES UP FOR IT THAT AND THE FACT THAT AUDIO SYSTEMS CAN ALWAYS BE UPGRAD
IMPROVE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY PROBLEMS
NOT ALL IPHONE APPS SUPPORTED ISSUES PLAYING SPOTIFY THROUGH THE MYLINK SYSTEM
AFTER THIS SURVEY I M GOING TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER MY CAMARO OFFERS VOICE ACTIVATED MUSIC CONTROL IF NOT THIS WOULD BE A VERY DESIRABLE FEATURE
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE INSTALLED  EQUIPPED IN ALL NEW CARS
VOICE COMMANDS ARE TOO DISJOINTED YOU CAN T SAY PLAY ALBUM X IN ONE STATEMENT YOU HAVE TO SAY PLAY ALBUM THEN WAIT FOR THE SYSTEM TO ASK WHAT ALBUM BEFORE REQUESTING IT IS VERY DISTRACTING
NAV IS SOMEWHAT CONFUSING TO USE IT SOMETIMES SELECTS HIGHWAY ROUTING WHEN SURFACE ROADS WORLD BE FASTER
THE VOICE RECOGNITION DEFINITELY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
NAV SYSTEM IS COMBURSOME COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES & NOT ACCURATE SEVERAL TIMES
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE MORE INTUITIVE AND USE DATA FROM CELL PHONE TO ENTER ADDRESSES ETC OVER BLUETOOTH WITHOUT HAVING TO CONNECT TO USB
PROVIDE HARD DRIVE STORAGE
I SHOULD HAVE PAID THE EXTRA MONEY FOR THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM THE STOCK ONE IS OK BUT NOT GREAT
LESS STEPS TO TAKE WHEN USING PHONE A TUNER BUTTON TO SEARCH FOR ANY LOCAL STATIONS AND A TUNER BUTTON TO TURN OFF AUDIO SYSTEM INSTEAD OF JUST A MUTE BUTTON
DO NOT LIKE THE GPS IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO USE THAN THE GARMIN GPS WE HAVE IN ANOTHER VEHICLE DISPLAY OF ROUTE STREETS AND HIGHWAYS IS DIFFICULT TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND ADDRESS IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO INPUT AS IT DOES NOT LET ME ENTER STREET ADD
VOICE RECOGNITION IS FAR BELOW EXPECTATIONS
MORE ACCURATE NAVIGATION
HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY SMART PHONE MUSIC THRU SOUND SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM STINKS SEE PREVIOUS
I AM A SENIOR CITIZEN AND DO NOT LIKE TOUCH SCREEN DEVICES TO CONTROL MY VEHICLE S FUNCTIONS I WOULD PREFER KNOBS AND SWITCHES ALTHOUGH THE ENCLAVE S TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS WORK WELL THEY ARE NOT MY PREFERENCE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A BIT COMPLICATED WHEN DRIVING VERY FEATURE RICH BEST TO HAVE PASSENGER WORKING IT WHILE YOU DRIVE VOICE COMMANDS DON T WORK WELL
SYSTEM IN OUR F250 FORD IS MUCH BETTER WEATHER MAP AND ICON FOOR GAS AND FOOD LOCATION
TOUCH SCREEN SUCKS AND IT DROPS MY CALLS FROM MY PHONE
STORING DESTINATIONS IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT COMPARED TO A GARMIN PORTABLE GPS
NAV STINKS NEEDS TO USE ALL ROADS MENU CHOICES WORDED BADLY CALCULATION OF TIME OF ARRIVAL TERRIBLE
BLUETOOTH CONNECTS TO PHONE BUT REQUIRES SOME EFFORT TO GET TO PHONE COMMANDS
TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVITY SEEMS TO BE AN ISSUE HAVE TO TOUCH THE DISPLAY ICONS SEVERAL TIMES TO ACTIVATE APP
TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS HELP VERY UNRESPONSIVE
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SUBWOOFER
AS PREVIOUSLY STATED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE
SPEAKERS AND STATION CONNECTIVITY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT ACCURATE WHEN DIRECTING ME TO MY DESTINATION AND THE TOUCH SCREEN DOESN T RECOGNIZE THE KEY I M TRYING TO PRESS AND THERE IS A HUGE DELAY WHEN PRESSING KEYS BEFORE IT SHOWS ON THE DISPLAY
CONNECTIVITY TO USB PORT FOR MUSIC IS FANTASTIC
IT S TOUGH TO FIGURE OUT IT S STILL SLUGGISH WITH IPOD CLASSICS
WHEN ENTERING DESTINATION THE KEYBOARD TOUCH CONTROL DOES NOT RESPOND WELL YOU HAVE TO HOLD DOWN ON THE LETTER FIRMLY FOR A LONG TIME
TOUCH CONTROLS ON RADIO ARE HARD TO USE RADIO KEEPS REPRIMANDING US & TELLING US TO KEEP OUR EYES ON THE ROAD & WE DON T KNOW WHY
I HAVE TO SAY THAT I HAVENT HAD TIME TO DO ANY REAL CROSS COUNTRY TRAVELING WHERE I NEED TO USE NAVAGATION I HAVE A PERSONAL CELL PHONE AND DO NOT USE THE IN CAR PHONE THE RADIO WORKS GREAT
SPEECH RECOGNITION AND FASTER REACTION
I BELIEVE THAT I HAVE NOT SPENT ENOUGH TIME FIGURING OUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS I HAVE NOT BEEN DRIVING THE CAR VERY LONG THE TWO TIMES I TRIED TO USE IT I ENDED UP CALLING ONSTAR I DO NOT HAVE A SMART PHONE SO I HAVE NOT TRIED THOSE FEATURES
SPEAKERS LESS THAN STELLAR CONTROLS FOR SOUND SYSTEM POOR AND SHOULD BE BETTER FOR PRICE PAID USB PORT IN CONSOLE DOES NOT RECOGNIZE IPHONE MEDIA AM INSTEAD USING AFTER MARKET USB CONNCTORS THROUGH CIGGARETTE LIGHTER PORT IN BACK SEAT AREA RUN
PERHAPS I NEED MORE INFO ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT AT TIMES I WANT TO TAKE A CERTAIN ROUTE AND THE NAVIGATION INSISTS UNTIL IT REALIZES THAT I AM NOT GOING ITS CHOSEN ROUTE
SENDING TEXT MESSAGES THROUGH THE VOICE RECOGNITION
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS NOT TO RECOGNIZE ANY SPOKEN COMMANDS I DON T USE IT ALTHOUGH I D LIKE TO BECAUSE IT IS TOO TROUBLESOME
I HAVE ONLY USED THE AUDIO SYSTEM
CHANGING STATIONS DIFFICULT SWIPING FEATURE IS TERRRIBLE
INCREASE THE FAVORITES LIST OR CATEGORIZE THAT LIST BY SUBJECT
RECOGNIZING VOICE COMMANDS
BLUETOOTH COMMAND RECOGNITION
I DON T USE MUCH OTHER THAN FM RADIO WHICH IS JUST FINE THE NAVIGATION IS DISAPPOINTING BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO BE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND I M SURE IF I TAKE THE TIME TO READ AND RE READ THE BOOK IT MAY BE UNDERSTANDABLE AT LEAST I HOPE IT S A VERY E
ENSURING THAT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS AS UP TO DATE AS POSSIBLE ONE EXAMPLE IS THAT THE FIRST WEEK WE HAD THE VEHICLE WE WERE IN SEARCH OF A HARDWARE STORE BUT THE LOCATION WE WERE SENT TO WAS AN EMPTY STORE
I USE THE BLUTOOTH HANDSFREE A LOT COMMON COMPLAINT FROM PERSON ON THE OTHER END IS THAT THEY CAN T HEAR ME VERY WELL LOUSY CONNECTION I HAVE NOT HAD THIS PROBLEM IN OTHER BUICKS I HAVE OWNED
REAL TIME TRAFFIC DISPLAY DOES NOT COVER AS MUCH AS OTHER VEHICLES SEEMS TO BE DUE TO XM VERSUS SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO
USB CONNECTIVITY WAS PART OF A $3 000 OPTION COULD NOT AFFORD IT THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD
THE NAV SYSTEM IS VERY POOR IN UNDERSTANDING COMMANDS
JUST OFFER BOSE ON ALL BUICKS REGARDLESS OF TRIM LEVEL HAD ISSUES WITH GETTINGMY OTHER FAVORITES TO DISPLAY ON THE TOUCH SCREEN
PEOPLE SAY IT SOUNDS LIKE I AM UNDER WATER WHEN I TALK ON THE BLUETOOTH THE NAVIGATION HARDLY FINDS WHERE I WANT TO GO AND THEN LEADS ME OUT OF THE SWAY TO GET THERE I CAN NEVER FIND CURRENT TRAFFIC ON THE NAVIGATION
8 OUT OF 10 TIMES LOVE ONSTAR ASSISTANCE
THE FM AND AM RADIO RECEPTION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED A LOT ALSO MY PHONE FREEZES UP WHEN PLAYING PANDORA AND CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH TO THE CAR
TOUCH SCREEN
CALLING OR RECEIVING CALLS SOUND QUALITY IS LESS THAN DESIRABLE ESPECIALLY WITH COMPARISON TO THE SOUND SYSTEM OF THE RADIO
NAV SYSTEM PREY POOR FOR MAKING ENTRIES
NAVIGATION SHOULDN T HAVE TO BE THROUGH ONSTAR
THE NAVIGATION ONLY WORKS SOMETIMES AND IS NOT EASY TO ENTER INFO GM SHOULD TEAM UP WITH A LARGE MAP FIRM TO CREATE AN EASIER USER INTERFACE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO HAVE PEOPLE USE ON STAR PHONE CONNECTIVITY FOR MAPS COULD WORK WELL ALSO WAITING F
ALLOW PASSENGER CONTROL OF NAVI SYSTEM WHILE MOVING ELSE FIX THE VR AS IT IS THE VR IS MORE DISTRACTING THAN TYPING THE ADDRESS
PHONE CALL SOUND CAN BE WAY BETTER
BLUETOOTH SOFTWARE IS CRAP
WHEN PLUGGING IN THE IPHONE THROUGH USB THE CAR AUTOMATICALLY ASSUMES YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND STARTS PLAYING IT THIS IS NOT A FEATURE WE CAN TURN OFF
FASTER LOADING BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION
EXCELLENT OVERALL JUST WISH THE VOICE COMMAND HAD AN EASIER TIME RECOGNIZING MY SPECIFIC COMMAND SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT
VOICE RECOGNITION VOLUME ON PHONE CALLS
THE SCREEN MENU INTERFACE IS NOT GOOD AT ALL NEEDS TO BE MUCH SIMPLER AND REQUIRE LESS FOCUS FROM DRIVER WAY TOO DIFFICULT TO MANAGE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS CHANGING THE RADIO STATION WHILE DRIVING THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ALSO NEED IMPROVEMENT
WORKS WELL ALTHOUGH I DON T LIKE SOME SAFETY FEATURES LIKE DISABLING OPERATIONS WHEN VEHICLE IS IN MOTION IT ALSO HAS SOME ISSUES WITH THE TEXT MESSAGING SYSTEM SUCH AS THE QUICK RESPONSES ARE NOT SENT THE CALL FUNCTION ON THE TEXT MESSAGE DOES
SYSTEM DOESN T RECOGNIZE VOICE COMMANDS LOUSY FRUSTRATING
VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD BE IMPROVED GPS NAVIGATION SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO GOOGLE MAPS IN TERMS OF EASE OF USE FOR A FRIENDLIER EXPERIENCE
I ONLY USE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WHICH I REALLY LIKE I DON T USE OTHERS APPLICATIONS SO I CAN T COMMENT
IT S HARD TO SAY OVERALL I LIKE IT BUT IT DOESN T BLOW ME OUT OF THE WATER OK HERE S ONE VOICE RECOGNITION IS DECENT BUT IT COULD BE IMPROVED
I CAN T GET PANDORA TO WORK
CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL FOR RADIO CONTROLS BECAUSE DISPLAY IN DASH IS DISTRACTING
ALLOW USB TO BE POWERED WHEN CAR IS OUT OF SERVICE SO IT MAINTAINS CHARGING CAPABILITIES TO DEVICES
VOICE RECOGNITION ISN T ALWAYS ACCURATE
NEED BETTER AND SIMPLER TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS FOR YOUR PHONE MUSIC PLAYER
THE PRESET BUTTONS ON THE RADIO SHOULD BE BAND SOURCE RELATED FOR XM RADIO THE STATION NAMES SHOULD BE LARGE IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT STATION YOU ARE LISTENING TO
ADDING WAYPOINTS AND EDITING ROUTES CAN BE RATHER FRUSTRATING
POWER OF AM FM RADIO
SPEAKER SHOULD HAVE BETTER SOUND VOICE RECOGNITION STILL DOESN T GET IT ALL THE TIME & TOO MANY STEPS TO MAKE A CALL MISS HAVE 6 CD CHANGER THIS PRIUS ONLY ALLOWS 1 CD MUSIC BUTTONS CONSTANTLY LEAD TO XM RADIO I DIDN T SUBSCRIBE GETTING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT INTUITIVE
I M OLD SCHOOL I D RATHER HAVE KNOBS AND BUTTONS AND LCD DISPLAY OVER TOUCH SCREEN
DIFFICULT ACCESSING AND CHANGING RADIO STATIONS WHILE DRIVING
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE STANDARD
NEED NAVIGATION DISPLAY AND INFO READILY ACCESSIBLE
THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM HAS A HAD TIME RECOGNIZING MY VOICE COMMANDS
VOLKSWAGEN DESPERATELY NEEDS TO ADD CARPLAY SUPPORT I ALMOST BOUGHT ANOTHER BRAND BECAUSE OF THIS
DOWNLOAD MUSIC INSTEAD OF BLUETOOTH
USB PORT FOR IPOD ACCESSIBLE ON THE MOST ECONOMIC VERSION
NAVIGATION INPUT IS CUMBERSOME
WOULD PREFER TO HAVE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM BESIDES VOLUME
ABILITY TO CONTROL THE SPEED OF SPEECH MAKE IT FASTER LESS LAG AND BETTER SPEECH RECOGNITION
SOMETHING BESIDES BOSE
WISH I GOT THE BANG & OLUFSON SYSTEM INSTEAD OF THE BOSE SYSTEM
CONNECTIVITY WITH ANDROID PHONES
INTERNET OPTIONS ARE QUITE COMPLICATED NO TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE
ADD USB PORTS OVER THE CURRENT MIDI ADD MORE SMARTPHONE INTEGRATION MAIL AND TEXT AND APPS
BLUETOOTH IS A LITTLE SLOW TO CONNECT
VEHICLE HAS BLUETOOTH BUT I DON T USE IT
EASIER SET UP FOR THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
PANDORA DOES NOT CONNECT WELL WITH PHONE HAVE NOT TRIED OTHER BUILT IN APPS I USUALLY JUST USE BLUETOOTH TO CONNECT PHONE BUT DO NOT PLUG IN TO THE USB BECAUSE PANDORA DOES NOT WORK WELL WHEN PHONE IS PLUGGED IN
IMPROVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND TOUCH SCREEN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE I DON T EVEN BOTHER TO USE IT THE AUDIO FROM MY SMART PHONE S NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T COME THROUGH IN THE CAR AUDIO SO I HAVE TO USE IT INDEPENDENTLY SPEAKERS ARE TREBLE HEAVY BUT OTHERWISE PRETTY GOOD
VOICE COMMANDS TOO COMPLICATED TO INPUT DESTINATIONS
TOO NEW TO CAR TO MAKE FAIR EVALUATION STILL LEARNING HARD DRIVE ACCESS DOWN LOAD INTO IS TOO SPECIFIC WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MULTIPLE WAYS TO DOWNLOAD   ACCEPT MUSIC
QUALITY POWER OF AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY BAREBONES
LOCATION OF TOUCH CONTROL SHOULD BE HIGHER IN CENTER STACK TO AVOID DISTRACTION WHILE USING
A LARGER HI RES TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE GREAT THE TOUCH SCREEN IS LOW RES AND A BIT SMALL
CONFUSING AND TOO COMPLICATED I AM A SURGEON NOT A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER AND I JUST WANT TO DRIVE AND LISTEN TO MUSIC NOT NAVIGATE A MILLION TOUCH SCREENS
AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED IF THE CDR HAD BLUETOOTH MUSIC STREAMING IN ADDITION TO THE ABILITY TO TAKE CALLS
I USE GOOGLE MAPS OR WAZE I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE ONE OF THESE SERVICES ADDED ON TO YOU VEHICLES AS THEY ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY NAVIGATION SYSTEM
BLUETOOTH FOR MP3 IPOD DEVICES TO BE BASIC STANDARD THE SOUND PACKAGE PLUS SYSTEM TO BE THE BASIC STANDARD
THE TECHNOLOGY USED IS OUTDATED PORSCHE NEEDS TO BUY A TESLA AND LEARN HOW TO DO INTERIORS THE MUSIC SYSTEM IS GREAT BUT EVERYTHING ELSE SUCKS POOR VOICE RECOGNITION ANCIENT MAPS WHY NOT JUST USE GOOGLE MAPS OR WAZE THEY ALSO HAVE THE AHA
CONNECTING TO PANDORA RADIO SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT HAVING THE SYSTEM CONNECT IT JUST DOESN T READ IT
NAVIGATION IS NOT GOOD
NAVIGATION SCREEN COULD BE LARGER
INPUTTING DESTINATION INTO NAV DOES NOT FOLLOW NORMAL LOGIC IT SHOULD REMEMBER THE COUNTRY AND STATE I M LOCATED IN AND NOT MAKE ME INPUT THIS INFO EVERY TIME
EASIER USE AS PER PREVIOUS CRITIQUE OF NAVIGATION AND STREAMING MUSIC
NAV SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED
CONNECTING BLUETOOTH RADIO IS TOO MANY STEPS
ORDERED UPGRADED SYSTEM IT SHOULD HAVE BETTER SOUND ALSO SOUND QUALITY OF INCOMING CALLS IS BELOW AVERAGE
NAVIGATION NEEDS GOOGLE LIKE THE AUDI
MORE EASIER WAY OF INDICATION ADDRESS OF DESIRED LOCATION FOR ROUTE GUIDANCE
VOICE ACTIVATION
SOUND QUALITY IS A DISAPPOINTMENT NOW I KNOW WHY PORSCHE OFFERS TWO UPGRADES OUR VOLVOS HAVE A BETTER SOUND
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS UNACCEPTABLE THE GPS SYSTEM FROM A $69 00 HAND HELD IS SUPERIOR TO THIS SYSTEM
EASE OF USING NAVIGATION BMW HAD THE ABILITY TO CALL FOR DOWNLOADING EVERYTHING FROM ADDRESSES TO LOCATION OF RESTAURANTS HOTELS ETC CALLED BMW ASSIST ALSO MISS HEADS UP DISPLAY IN DRIVERS WINDOW LOVED THAT ON MY BMW
DIFFICULT TO ENTER A NEW ADDRESS WITH THE DIAL OPTION AND NO TOUCHSCREEN
DATED TECHNOLOGY IS USED WORSE THAN MY LEXUS A LARGER TOUCH SCREEN IS A MUST
THE IPHONE IPOD JACK IS NOT DESIGNED FOR NEWER PHONES EVEN THOUGH THIS VEHICLE IS A I HATE THAT THE IN DASH RADIO CONTROLS DEFAULT TO SATELLITE RATHER THAN PRESETS AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH THE OTHER FEATURES TO GET TO AUDIO
NAV SYSTEM OPTION IS EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET
BASE AUDIO IS OK BUT BOSE AND HIGH END SUDIO YOO EXPENDIVE FOR MY NEEDS
PHONE CONNECTION SHOULD ALLOW ME TO SET OR IMPORT IMPORTANT NUMBERS RATHER THAN BROWSE PHONE BOOK OR MOST RECENT CALLS
TOO MANY STEPS TO FIND STATIONS THAT ARE NOT FAVORITES
VOICE COMMANDS THAT ACTUALLY WORK WOULD BE NICE TO AVOID TAKING YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD
I AM UNABLE TO USE BLUETOOTH AUDIO WHEN THERE IS AN IPOD CONNECTED VIA USB I WAS TOLD THAT THIS WAS NORMAL FOR THE CURRENT PORSCHE COMMUNICATION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE
SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER NAVIGATION COULD BE EASIER
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD CUSTOMIZE THE GPS DISPLAY TO INCLUDE THE ALTITUDE LIKE IN THE AUDI Q7 IT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD IF YOU COULD CONTROL ADJUST THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS SCREENS FROM THE FRONT SCREEN DISPLAY
THE MAP RESOLUTION IS MINIMAL UNLESS YOU ZOOM WAY IN I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE MORE STREET DETAILS AND NAMES WITHOUT HAVING TO ZOOM IN SO FAR
PLUG FOR IPHONE IS IN THE GLOVE BOX HOW DO I CONTROL THE IPHONE THEN POOR DESIGN
POOR ANDROID CONNECTIVITY POOR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE USAGE
TOO MUCH MIDRANGE NEEDS A GRAPHIC EQUALIZER TO CONTROL SOUND
NAVIGATING MUSIC IN HARD DRIVE AND IPOD IS DIFFICULT FOR EXAMPLE
MAIN ONE IS PHONEBOOK WHILE IN CAR WITH BLUETOOTH ON
DOESN T RECOGNIZE OLDER CELL PHONES
OVERALL BASE STEREO IS DISAPPOINTINGLY AVERAGE FOR SUCH A HIGH END CAR STEREO UPGRADE SEEMS OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE WE OPTED NOT TO GET THE NAV BECAUSE WE EXPECT TO HAVE THE CAR A LONG TIME AND FIGURED IT WOULD BE COME OBSOLETE TOO SOON
I LISTEN TO THE FM RADIO EXCLUSIVELY I NEVER USE THE NAVIGATION COMMUNICATION OR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS
USB PORT ON BASE STEREO
ADDRESS ENTRY IN THE GPS SYSTEM IS BALKY AT BEST NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY TAKES TOO LONG TO ENTER COMMON ADDRESSES
VERY TIME CONSUMING TO ENTER DESTINATION INFORMATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE AND INTUITIVE BASED ON CURRENT LOCATION TRAVEL PATTERNS
FROM A USER INTERFACE PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE TOO MANY INPUT AVENUES TO ACHIEVE THE SAME SYSTEM CONTROL OBJECTIVE THE NAVIGATION INTERFACE HAS TOO MANY DEAD ENDS IT NEEDS TO ACCEPT SOFTER LOGIC INPUTS AS IT IS NOW WHEN YOU GET TO A LOGICAL DEAD
MAKE ENTERING YOUR DESTINATION INTO THE NAVI SYSTEM EASIER CURRENTLY THE ADDRESS MUST BE ENTERED IN A CERTAIN ORDER OR IT WILL BE REJECTED E G MUST START WITH COUNTRY STATE ETC EVEN THOUGH THE BOOK SAYS COUNTRY AND STATE ARE NOT REQUIRED A
BLUETOOTH CALLS SUCK NOISY AND ECHO LIKE SOUND
VOICE COMMANDS NEVER UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY I DO NOT YOU IT BECAUSE IT IS FRUSTRATING NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST TO DRIVERS VOICE
READ TEXT MESSAGES FROM AN IPHONE
OLDER IPOD CONNECTIVITY OCCASIONALLY WILL CLAIM UNSUPPORTED DEVICE ON 4TH GEN TOUCH
IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION AND NAVIGATION INPUT
BE ABLE TO CONTROL MY PHONE BETTER WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS SUCH AS ACCESSING TEXT MESSAGES OR CONTROLLING THE AUDIO PLAYER ON MY PHONE OR BEING ABLE TO ACCESS SPEED DIAL AND CALL HISTORY FROM STEERING CONTROLS THE CALL HISTORY AND SPEED
I ELECTED NOT TO PURCHASE THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM OR NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS PERFORMING TO MY EXPECTATIONS RECOGNIZING THIS IS NOT THE TOP OF THE LINE
VOICE RECOGNITION AND BEING ABLE TO OPERATE NAVI WHILE CAR IS DRIVING PASSENGER ACCESSIBLE
DISPLAY IS LOW QUALITY FOR LUXURY CAR AUDIO SYSTEM IS AVERAGE OVERALL
NAV SYSTEM SOMETIMES DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO PUT IN ADDRESS OR CAN T FIND A VALID ADDRESS NEED TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE WHEN DRIVING PASSENGER NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO USE IT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE ENABLED WHEN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT IS OCCUPIED
MAKE THE NAV SYSTEM AS EASY TO USE AS MY IPHONE S
IT ALWAYS SEEMS TO ME THAT IN VEHICLE AUDIO AND NAVIGATION FUNCTIONALITY LAGS SEVERAL YEARS BEHIND WHAT IS AVAILABLE ON SMART PHONES AND TABLETS AS SOMEONE WHO IS EXTREMELY WELL VERSED IN THE USE OF THESE OTHER DEVICES I FIND THE RELATIVELY OLD
ALL MODELS SHOULD COME WITH SIRIUS CAPABILITY REDESIGN STEREO FACE AND KNOBS TO HAVE A CLEANER LOOK THE DISPLAY SCREEN NEEDS BETTER TECHNOLOGY AS THE DISPLAY COLORS DEFINITION LOOKS VERY DATED INFORMATION FROM AUX SOURCE SHOULD FEED INTO DISP
NEEDS TO BE EASIER TO USE RARELY TAKES ME TO THE BEST ROUTE MY PHONE APPS HAVE BETTER DIRECTIONS
VOICE COMMAND NOT LIMITED TO CALLS ONLY
THE NAV SYSTEM DOESN T LIKE ADDRESSES THAT CONTAIN LETTERS AND NUMBERS W87 S1357 PROVIDENCE CT AS A RESULT IS BECOMES LESS EFFECTIVE
IT DOESN T INTEGRATE WELL WITH MY PHONE IPHONE 6 PLUS IF IT WORKED AT LEAST AS WELL AS IT WORKS WITH A WINDOWS PHONE I WOULD BE OVER THE MOON
USING TOUCH SCREEN OPTIONS VERY DIFFICULT WHILE DRIVING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS STILL CUMBERSOME TO USE AND CANNOT ALWAYS ENTER THE ADDRESS YOU NEED AS IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE IT
TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS LOOK NICE BUT ARE NOT INTUITIVE AND EFFICIENT ALSO NAV AND VOICE RECOGNITION ARE A LITTLE SLOW
THE VOICE COMMANDS ARE HARD TO USE REQUIRING MULTIPLE STEPS THAT YOU CANNOT DO WITHOUT TAKING YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD THIS IS MY THIRD VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND BY FAR THE WORSE FOR A LUXURY CAR THE VOICE COMMANDS ARE ANYTHING BUT L
IT IS CUMBERSOME TO INPUT ADDRESSES INTO THE SYSTEM I REALLY DON T USE IT AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE BECAUSE IT IS SO DIFFICULT
I MOSTLY ONLY USE BLUETOOTH FOR HAVING CONVERSATIONS THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND I HEAR AND THE MIC ARE EXCEPTIONAL RARELY DOES SOMEONE SAY THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE HEARING ME
CONNECTING MY PHONE SEEMS REALLY HIT OR MISS I LL BE LISTENING TO MUSIC SOMEONE WILL CALL THEN I CAN T GET MY MUSIC GOING AGAIN I M NOT SURE IF I M DOING SOMETHING INCORRECTLY BUT IT ALL SEEMS TO NEED TO DOWNLOAD ALL MY PANDORA STATIONS EVERY
UPGRADE OUTDATED GRAPHICS ON NAV SYSTEM AND IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
ERGONOMICS BAD AND USER INTERFACE IS VERY POOR TOO MANY STEPS AND COORDINATING 2 SCREENS AND MENU BUTTONS IS FAR TOO CONFUSING AND I AM TECH SAVVY MY WIFE WON T EVEN CONSIDER USING THE SYSTEM DUE TO DIFFICULTY AND FEAR OF SCREWING SOMETHING UP T
QUALITY OF PHONE CALLS OVER BLUETOOTH IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR
WISH THERE WAS MORE VOICE RECOGNITION
SIMPLIFY THERE ARE TOO MANY WAYS TO GET TO THE END RESULT AND TOO MANY STEPS TO GET THERE CREATING DRIVING DISTRACTIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN SAFETY ISSUES VOICE PROMPTS NEED TO BE COMPLETELY OVERHAULED NAV MAPS ARE DATED
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CANNOT BE OPERATED BY THE PASSENGER WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION NOR CAN THE PASSENGER USE THE VOICE ACTIVATED FEATURES OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN ORDER TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM EITHER THE DRIVER HAS TO SPEAK ALL VOI
THE NAVIGATION S ADDRESS METHODOLOGY IS CUMBERSOME
VOICE RECOGNITION USUALLY DOESN T WORK AS EXPECTED DISPLAY WITH MUSIC DATA COULD SHOW MORE INFORMATION LIKE THE ALBUM S ART
CORRECT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM PROBLEM
HAVE NOT READ MY MANUAL TO SEE HOW TO MASTER THE VOICE COMMANDS YET SEEMS OVERWHELMING AND I WISH THAT WOULD BE EASIER
I D LIKE A LARGER COLOR DISPLAY MONITOR WITH TOUCHSCREEN
LOCATION OF THE USB CONNECTOR
NEED TO IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD DO A FEW THINGS WELL NOT ALL THINGS NOT SO WELL NAVIGATION TRAFFIC DISPLAY SHOULD ADJUST FOR COLOR BLIND DRIVERS
NAVIGATION EASE OF USE
HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING THE PHONE TO PULL UP CONTACTS AT TIMES OR RECOGNIZE VOICE WHEN WANTING TO MAKE HANDS FREE PHONE CALL BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE WITH MY MDX
I CAN T GET THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AT TIMES TO ROUTE ME TO AN ADDRESS THE OPTION TO ROUTE IS NOT HIGHLIGHTED TO USE VERY FRUSTRATION WHEN I NEED DIRECTIONS TO A PARTICULAR PLACE IN A HURRY
ADDING ADDRESSES
REDUCING POINTS OF CONTROL AND ASSCESS TO ONE VOICE CONTROL AND ONE DASH CONTROL SYSTEM AND MAKING THE WHOLE SYSTEM MORE INTUITIVE AND A LIILTE LESS CLUMSY ITS NOT BAD BUT IT COULD BE BETTER
RADIO CHANNELS ON TOUCH SCREEN ARE DISTRACTING TO USE WHILE DRIVING
MAKE NAVIGATION AS GOOD AS GOOGLE MAP POI WAS USELESS BECAUSE IT DOESN T SHOW POI NEAR ME
THE PHONE DIRECTORY AND VOICE ACTIVATED PHONE NUMBER LOOKUP IS CONFUSING AND SEEMS OVERLY COMPLICATED
HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH VOICE COMMANDS
EASE OF USE BY VOICE COMMAND BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION
SIMPLIFY AND ALLOW CHANGING SCANNING THRU AL XM STATION NOT JUST PRESELECTED
CONNECTIVITY WITH IPHONE IS UNPREDICTABLE WHEN USING PANDORA AND OR PHONE AP NAVIGATION
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WITH SMARTPHONE COULD BE IMPROVED SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT TURN MEDIA ON AND OFF RELIABLY
VOICE COMMANDS ON NAV SYSTEM ARE A REAL PROBLEM AND THEY ARE NOT AT ALL INTUITIVE
EASE OF ENTERING DESTINATION
NAVIGATION THROUGH VOICE COMMAND SHOULD BE EASIER ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING VOICE COMMANDS ARE INCONSISTENT WHEN DRIVING MISSED TURN ONCE
I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET AUDIO PLAYLISTS FROM MY IPHONE THERE ARE A LOT OF MENUS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM TOO HARD TO USE
I DON T FEEL AS THOUGH THE AUDIO SOUND IS AS SPECTACULAR AS IT SHOULD BE I BOUGHT A LUXURY VEHICLE AND SHOULD HAVE AN AWESOME AUDIO SYSTEM IT DOESN T MY HUSBAND HAS A LEXUS CT200 AND HIS HAS AN AWESOME SOUND SYSTEM
THERE IS NO TOUCH SCREEN NAVIGATION
REMOVING THE DUAL SCREENS THERE SHOULD BE ONE SCREEN WHICH CONTROLS THE COMMANDS THE TWO SCREENS IS CONFUSING
I BELIEVE THE SYSTEMS ARE PROBABLY FINE THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME EDUCATION BY THE DEALERSHIP TO FAMILIARIZE THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY
VOICE COMMANDS ARE NOT ALWAYS INTUITIVE AND SHOULD BE MORE FLEXBILE REALLY ACURA SHOULD FULLY IMPLEMENT THE APPLE IN CAR SYSTEM NOT JUST THE VERY BASIC SYSTEM CURRENTLY IN PLACE
NAVIGATIONAL MAPS UI SEE EARLIER COMMENTS
VOICE RECOGNITION CAPABILITY IS POOR
THE VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER
MMI INTEGRATION WITH APPLE IOS AND EASE OF USE WITH VEHICLES JUKEBOX AND MUSIC APPS PANDORA IHEART ETC THEY ARE NOT AS EASY TO USE AND DON T OPERATE AS EASILY AS SATELLITE RADIO AND IPOD
WHILE IT LOOKS GREAT THERE ARE SO MANY OPTIONS IT IS CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN DRIVING THE MAIN SILVER KNOB MOVES COUNTER CLOCKWISE TO SCROLL DOWN WHICH DRIVES ME CRAZY I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD BE CLOCKWISE I CONNECT MY IPOD OVERTIME
EASE OF USE OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IT CAN TAKE MULTIPLE STEPS TO PERFORM SIMPLE DESIRED OPERATIONS
THE SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE HOWEVER ANYTIME I TRY TO PLACE A CALL AND TALK WHILE DRIVING THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END TELLS ME THEY HEAR TOO MUCH ROAD NOISE SO I END UP TAKING IT OFF BLUETOOTH AND JUST TALK ON MY PHONE TOO BAD BECAUSE THIS
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR ADDRESSES COULD BE STRENGTHENED
I AM STILL TRYING THE DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENTS TO GET THE FEATURES I LIKE I FIND IT SOMEWHAT CONFUSING USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COMPARED TO A GARMIN
I RATHER HAVE AN AUTOMATIC BACK HATCH OPENER AND NOT THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM
ONCE AGAIN IT GOES TO THE ANTIQUATED LOOK THIS ENTIRE SYSTEM HAS IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM THE EARLY 90 S WITH THAT SAID IT S VERY EASY TO USE EASY TO LEARN BUT I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE AUDIO SYSTEM A BIT MORE I GOT RID OF A NIS
VOICE COMMANDS ARE OFTEN NOT UNDERSTOOD
ENTERING ADDRESS IN NAVIGATION IS VERY HARD IT SHOULD BE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY
UNCLEAR HOW TO UTILIZE SO DON T BASICALLY LISTEN TO 1 RADIO STATION OR 1 CD AT A TIME NEED CLEARER INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO UTILIZED CD AND GET TO STORED CD MUSIC SCANNED IN
CAN T BELIEVE BUYING A BRAND NEW AUDI A4 IN HAS THE OLD APPLE 30 PIN CONNECTOR NOT THE NEW LIGHTNING CONNECTOR
I THINK THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS A LOT TO BE DESIRED THOUGH THIS IS A PROBLEM I VE HAD ON MOST VEHICLES SMARTPHONE VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS TO DO SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANY CAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT I VE EVER USED
NAVIGATION IS NOT EASY TO USE MY ACURA USED TO RESPOND TO FIND NEAREST GAS STATION OR FIND NEAREST POST OFFICE AUDI S NEEDS A NUMBER STREET CITY CANNOT USE SIRI WHILE DRIVING IF I WANT TO DICTATE A REMINDER OR CHANGE SONGS OR T
MY RATING WAS INFLUENCED BY THE ONE TIME FAILURE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT INTUITIVE USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO USE THE EXACT CORRECT COMMAND AND THEIR ARE MANY IN ORDER FOR THE SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE THE COMMAND
IT S INCONVENIENT THAT THE IPOD CONNECTION IS IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT
DONT HAVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT WISH THE CAR HAD A COMPASS TO AT LEAST TELL YOU WHICH DIRECTION YOU ARE DRIVING
WHEN SUBWOOFER VOLUME IS HIGH SOME NOISE OR VIBRATION HAPPENS NOT SURE IS IT FROM SPEAKER
RELIABILITY OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND EASE OF USING NAV COMMANDS FOR FINDING ROUTES
THE SATELLITE RADIO IS WAY TOO BASIC CAN T SET FAVORITES AND CAN T SEE A VOLUME DISPLAY REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THAT
IMPROVED VOICE RECOGNITION MIS INTERPRETS ADDRESSES
ENTERING AN ADDRESS IN THE NAVIGATION IS CUMBERSOME AS IT SEARCHES THROUGH ALL STATES WITH THE SAME STREET IT SHOULD ALLOW USER TO LOOK ONLY IN THE SPECIFIC STATE
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR AUDIO COMMUNICATION I ALSO WISH I HAD SOME SORT OF USB PORT OR AUX CABLE TO CONNECT AN IPOD THAT IS NOT BLUETOOTH
DOES NOT HAVE AUX OUTLET NEITHER USB OUTLET AND DOES NOT CONNECT TO OTHER DEVICE TROUGH BLUE T SYSTEM
HARD TO HEAR USING HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS
ADD 4G LTE RATHER THAN OUTDATED 3G IN A NEW VEHICLE
THE SOUND OF THE SPEAKERS I GUESS I AM SPOILED BY BOSE SYSTEM SOUND WITHOUT THE BOSE THE SOUNDS DON T SEEM AS CRISP AND DEFINED
NEEDS TO BE EASER TO INPUT DESTINATIONS IT S DIFFICULT TO ENTER ADDRESS S
IPOD INTERFACE IN GLOVE COMPARMENT IPOD SLOW TO RESPOND
THE PHONE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE LOADED EVERY TIME YOU START THE CAR THE NAV TELLS YOU EVERY TIME TO DO THE FOLLOWING LIST NUMBER STREET CITY AND STATE
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN THE SOUND QUALITY FROM SPEAKER SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEMS SOMETIMES CAN T UNDERSTAND COMMAND OF CERTAIN STREET NAMES CITIES
DIFFERENT CHOICES FOR VOICES FOR GUIDANCE ALSO SELECTING PHONE NUMBERS COULD BE EASIER
ALLOW CONNECTION OF EXTERNAL DEVICES THROUGH USB RATHER THAN AUDI CABLE
TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE HAS MULTIPLE MENUS WHICH CAUSE CONFUSION
MAKE IT MORE INTUITIVE EVEN MY TECH SAVVY SON THINKS IT NEEDS TO BE SIMPLIFIED CLOCK IS TOO SMALL AND IN THE WRONG PLACE IT SHOULD BE NEAR SPEEDOMETER NOT ON NAV SCREEN LOVE THE COMPASS
I DO NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM
VOICE COMMAND FUNCTION FAILS TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE MY REQUESTS QUITE OFTEN
I USE ANDROID PHONE AND TABLET THE APPLE SYSTEM IN GLOVE BOX NOT USED NO GARAGE EITHER
YOU AREN T IN THE SOFTWARE BIZ PARTNER WITH SOFTWARE COMPANIES FOR A BETTER EXPERIENCE IT SHOULDN T BE THAT MY PHONE HAS BETTER NAVIGATION THAN THE CAR
I HAVE 3 D NAVIGATION HOWEVER SOMETIMES IT TAKES A WHILE TO KICK IN
SOUND QUALITY NOT AS GOOD AS EXPECTED
INTERFACE DO NOT MAKE IT LIKE APPLE DO NOT MERGE SAVED POINTS OF INTERESTS SAVED LOCATIONS AND PHONE NUMBERS TOO HARD TO LOCATE A CONTACT
LEAVE MUCH OF THE USELESS THINGS OFF IMPROVE THE MAP FUNCTION AND DON T WORRY ABOUT THE DIRECTION FUNCTION ITS WRONG MOST OF THE TIME ANYWAY
NAV VOICE COMMAND
VOICE COMMANDS ARE STRANGE SOUND IS GOOD CONTROLS ARE ODD
I AM A 54 YEAR OLD GUY THERE IS JUST A LOT GOING ON WITH THE SYSTEM AND THE MORE INTUITIVE THE BETTER IT WOULD BE IF YOU DON T USE THE SYSTEM OFTEN LIKE NAV WHEN YOU GO BACK IN YOU CAN T REMEMBER HOW TO DO SOMETHING PROBABLY MORE ME THAN
BLUETOOTH NEEDS TO ALLOW STREAMING FROM PHONE CAR NEEDS AN AUX INPUT ALSO
THE SOUND SYSTEM ISN T AS GOOD AS THE BOSE SYSTEM WHICH MY CAR DOESN T HAVE
I PAID FOR THE UPGRADED BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIO SYSTEM I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A CAR AUDIO NUT SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF MY OVERALL VEHICLE EXPERIENCE THE SOUND SYSTEM IS GOOD BUT I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED BETTER SOUND QUALITY THE SYSTEM IS
TRAFFIC REROUTING AND TIME ESTIMATE IT IS ALMOST ALWAYS INACCURATE GOOGLE MAPS IS MUCH BETTER
NO USB NO AUXILLIARY THE INTERFACE NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED FOR LATEST MOBILE PHONES SO DEFINITELY NEED USB AS AN OPTION THIS SUCKS FOR A LUXURY CAR ESP WHEN YOU HAVE THAT FEATURE TO CONNECT MOBILE PHONE BUT CANNOT SINCE IT DOES NOT WORK WITH LATE
WON T ALLOW USB CONNECTION TO IPHONE FOR PLAYING MUSIC
THE VOICE RECOGNITION TAKES TOO MANY ATTEMPTS TO INTERPRET MY COMMANDS CORRECTLY
LACK OF A USB PORT
VOLUME CONTROL SHOULD BE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE A NICE OPTION THE DELAY WHEN SWITCHING FROM ONE SOURCE TO THE IPOD IS EXCESSIVE
OCCASIONALLY UPON STARTUP VEHICLE CONNECTS TO PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH INCORRECTLY
VOICE RECOGNITION AND START UP TIME FOR PHONE DIRECTORY AND SONGS TO LOAD
AUDIO FOR USE OF PHONE I DO NOT HAVE VOICE ACTIVATION IT IS BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY ALSO NAV SYSTEM IS VERY HARD TO USE I PROBABLY JUST NEED MORE TRAINING BUT IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE MY IPHONE OR IPAD WITH 3G 4G THAN THE NAV SYSTEM
THE RADIO DIAL IS AN ARMS LENGTH AWAY I CAN CONTROL IT FROM THE STEERING WHEEL BUT I HAVE A LIST OF ALL RADIO STATIONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL THE CONTROL THAT IS FARTHER AWAY HAS MY FAVORITES IT IS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE TO FLIP THROUGH THE ST
NEED MALE VOICE FOR NAV MEN HATE WOMEN TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO
2 STEP PROCESS TO CHANGE RADIO STATION DISLIKE
MAKE THE VOICE COMMANDS MORE INTUITIVE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE UP TO DATE TRAFFIC INFO
THE IPOD INTEGRATION HAS ISSUES IT RESETS ITSELF PERIODICALLY THE USER INTERFACE IS ALSO NOT GREAT
MY A5 DOES NOT HAVE A USB PORT WHICH IS RIDICULOUS THEY HAVE A CABLE IN THE GLOVE BOX WHICH IS SPECIFIC TO AUDI THERE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE A USB AND IPOD DOC STANDARD
MAKE THE CONTROLS AVAILABLE THROUGH TOUCH SCREEN
THE RADIO DISPLAY LOOKS PLAIN COMPARED TO THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY WHICH IS VERY PLEASING
UPGRADED BOSE SYSTEM
THIS IS THE LEAST SATISFYING ASPECT OF THE CAR I THINK A SUBWOOFER COULD ADD A LOT TO THE CARS OTHERWISE DECENT SOUND SYSTEM COMPARITIVELY SPEAKING I AM MORE IMPRESSED WITH THE ACURA TL AUDIO SYSTEM THAT STATED I DID NOT BUY AN S4 FOR AUDIO I
PEOPLE CONTINUE TO TELL ME IT S DIFFICULT TO HEAR IF I USE MY BLUETOOTH SYSTEM PHONE SYSTEM IN THE CAR SO I JUST USE MY WIRELESS EAR PIECE OR EARPHONES IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE CAR S BLUETOOTH SYSTEM
I WAS PREVIOUSLY USING GARMIN S TOP OF THE LINE DEVICE WHICH WAS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY IN MY OPINION THE AUDI S CONTROLS & GRAPHICS ALTHOUGH GOOD JUST DON T COMPARE TO THE EASE OF USE
ALL ARE GOOD OUTSTANDING EXCEPT FOR NAVIGATION WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO USE
I WISH THE NAV WOULD SAY WHICH SIDE OF THE STREET THE DESTINATION IS BEFORE I PASS IT
MORE EDUCATION ON HOW TO USE THE FEATURES UPDATED USB CONNECTION
THE SYSTEM USES A SPECIFIC AUX CORD FOR THIS CAR ONLY WOULD BE GOOD IF YOU COULD USE A IPHONE USB TO PLUG IN ALSO BLU TOOTH DOESN T WORK TO PLAY MUSIC FROM CELL THE RADIO IS VERY BASIC AND SO ARE THE SPEAKERS
TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE IDEAL WHILE DRIVING OPERATING SOME OF THE RADIO NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ALL DONE BY FEEL YOU REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING IS ON THE CENTER CONSOLE AUDI A4 TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE
THE SOUND OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL AND BEYOND ANY OTHER LUXURY BRAND WE VE HAD PREVIOUSLY UNFORTUNATELY MY RATING IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED BY THE EASE OF USE OF THE KNOBS AND ABILITY TO NAVIGATE FORM ONE TYPE OF MUSIC TO ANO
INCOMING VOLUME IS REALLY LOW SOMETIMES YOU VE GOT TO CRANK THE VOLUME INTO THE 30S OUT OF A POSSIBLE 40 TO HEAR THE PERSON YOU RE TALKING TO CAR S STEREO SYSTEM IS REALLY NICE IT S TOP END VOLUME ISN T GREAT AS EXPECTED IN MOST FACTORY IN
WHEN USING THE NAVIGATION SCREEN YOU CAN T SEE WHAT THE TEMPERATURE IS OUTSIDE ALSO WHEN USING THE NAVIGATION IT DOESN T TELL YOU HOW FAST YOU RE TRAVELING OR WHAT THE SPEED LIMIT IS
ITS FINE IT COULD BE BETTER AND MORE USER ORIENTED AND THE GPS DOESNT LET YOU CHANGE ADDRESSES WHICH IS REAL ANNOYING WHEN YOU ARE LOST AND CAN T FIND A SPOT TO PULL OVER TO CHANGE THE GPS EVEN IF THE PASSENGER IS OPERATING IT THEY SHOULD JUST
THE AMOUNT OF DIFFERENT KEYSTROKES IT TAKES TO GO THROUGH MENUS AND CHOOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE MINIMIZED ALSO GOING BACK AND FORTH FROM TACTILE BUTTONS TO TOUCH SCREEN IS A BIT DISTRACTING
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION BETTER CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL FOR NAVIGATING AUDIO JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE IS THE BEST FOR THIS
PHONE SOUND QUALITY NOT THAT GOOD TO THE PERSON CALLED AND THEY CAN LOUDLY HEAR THE TURN SIGNAL SOUND NO VOICE CONTROL OF PHONE SYSTEM EASIER TO USE THE VOICE CONTROL OF THE PHONE TO MAKE CALLS I PREFER NOT TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN CALL SYSTEM A
WHEN I PLUG IN MY IPHONE TO THE USB PORT IT AUTOMATICALLY STARTS PLAYING MUSIC I USUALLY AM JUST PLUGGING IT IN TO CHARGE IT SO THIS IS ANNOYING AND I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TURN OFF THAT FEATURE
VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE
UCONNECT BLUETOOTH NOT FULLY OPERABLE AND ADAPTABLE I WAS TOLD THIS COULD BE FIXED THEN WAS TOLD I WAS BASICALLY OUT OF LUCK
FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAY TAKE ME TO TARGET IN OTSEGO FOR NAVIGATION BUT THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW THAT YOU HAVE TO TYPE IN THE ADDRESS WHO WANTS TO TYPE IN ADDRESSES I END UP JUST USING MY PHONE FOR NAVIGATION
ENFORM APP IS JUST FRUSTRATING
I HAVE NOT YET FIGURED OUT HOW TO CONNECT MY IPHONE S INTERNET CAPABILITY INTO THE AUDIO SYSTEM FOR THINGS LIKE PANDORA AND NAVIGATION
IF HONDA HAD PROVIDED A MANUAL TO EXPLAIN THE FEATURES OF THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS I AM SURE IT WOULD BE EASIER TO USE THE SYSTEMS AND LEARN MORE ABOUT EACH FEATURE
TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS CONFUSING AND REDUNDANT ALSO DIFFICULT TO OPERATE WHEN VEHICLE IS IN MOTION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SCREEN IS PLACED TOO LOW IT CAUSES A DISTRACTION TO HAVE TO LOOK DOWN ALSO ANGLE OF THE SCREEN IS SUCH THAT WITH THE MOONROOF OPEN THE SUN CAN MAKE THE SCREEN HARD TO SEE
I HATE THE SAFETY LOCK ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN I M MOVING WHICH MAKES ME HAVE TO USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION PART OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHICH IS A TOTAL FAILURE
THE CAR IS SUPPOSED TO RECOGNIZE MY IPHONE AND PLAY FROM MY IPHONE WHEN I CONNECT VIA THE USB CABLE BUT THE CAR DOESN T RECOGNIZE THE PHONE AND THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY FROM THE PHONE IS VIA BLUETOOTH
MANY DON T WORK WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING MERCEDES NEEDS TO ALLOW PASSENGER CONTROL DISABLING HALF THE CARS FEATURES WHILE MOVING DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF HAVING THEM UNDER THE GUISE OF SAFETY
SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOUCHSCREEN INSTEAD OF ANTIUE TUN TWIST OF KNOB
MAKE NAV SYSTEM EASIER TO USE
SPEAKER NOT GOOD NAVIGATION NOT EASY TO USE
THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION NOT PICKING UP THE VOICE COMMANDS WELL EVEN THOUGH THE CAR COMES WITH A PERSONIFICATION TEACHER � IS REALLY A BUMMER NOT BEING ABLE TO STORE CONTACTS BY FIRST NAME INSTEAD OF LAST NAME FIRST IS ALSO VERY ANNOYING WHEN TR
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS AWFUL DOWNLOADING ADDRESSES FROM IPHONES IS COMPLETELY USELESS
I HAVE THE BOSE W  8 SPEAKERS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ONLY HAVE THE ONES UP FRONT YOU CAN T HERE THE ONES BEHIND THE SEAT AND THE SUB WOOFER IS ON THE SPARE TIME BUT BELOW THE COVER AND ALSO THE CARPET COVER
CANNOT TYPE IN AN ADDRESS INTO THE NAV SYSTEM WHEN DRIVING EVEN WHEN THERE IS A PASSENGER WHO COULD DO SO WITHOUT TAKING AWAY FROM DRIVING SAFELY
THE SCALE OF THE MAP ISN T THE BEST ALONG WITH THE STREET NAME DEPICTED ON THE SCREEN I USE MY IPHONE ALTHOUGH I WOULD RATHER USE THE CAR S SYSTEM
VOICE CONTROL LEAVES MORE ACCURATE RESPOND TO BE DESIRED I HAVE BOUGHT TWO LEXUS CARS ONE ES 350 AND ONE GS 350 FOUND THE VOICE CONTROL HASN T IMPROVED MUCH NEVERTHELESS WITH LEXUS I HAVE HAD MY BEST DRIVING EXPERIENCE HOPE IT WILL B
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO READ AND OVERLY COMPLES
NAVIGATION POINTED US TO THE WRONG WAY HOME TOOK US EAST INSTEAD OF WEST
TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS WOULD BE NICE BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTIVITY EVERYONE SAYS THAT IS SOUNDS LIKE I AM TALKING DOWN A WELL
BLUETOOTH KICKS IN TOO SLOW AND TAKES ABOUT 2 MIN VOICE RECOGNITION SUCKS AND LIMITED
IT IS VERY BAD AT KEEPING AN INTERNET SIGNAL AND I M IN ATLANTA I CAN T PLAY PANDORA THROUGH AUDI CONNECT BECAUSE IT CUTS OUT CONSTANTLY
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT GREAT COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES WE OWNED MERCEDES AND BMW THE LCD SCREEN IS TOO SMALL AND CROWDED ALMOST CAN T SEE THE MAP WHEN NAVIGATION IS ACTIVE BECAUSE OF MULTIPLE OVERLAYS ON TOP OF IT
IMPROVING THE VOICE COMMANDS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE DOESN T WORK WELL I AM CONSTANTLY INPUTTING THE NECESSARY INFORMATION MANUALLY BECAUSE IT IS A HASSLE TO FIGHT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
BASS OUTPUT OF THE VERY EXPENSIVE BANG & OLUFSEN AUDIO SYSTEM IS SOMEWHAT WEAK OVERALL AUDIO QUALITY AND ACCURACY INCLUDING BASS IS EXCELLENT JUST NOT AS IMPACTFUL AS SOME OTHER HIGH END SYSTEMS
MY SMART PHONE IS BLUETOOTH CONNECTED AND I FIND AUDI S SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO USE DISCONNECTING THE CALL ACCESSING NAMES
VOICE COMMANDS WITHOUT HAVING TO HAVE NAVIGATION FEATURE INSTALLED
I HAVE TROUBLE FIGURING OUT HOW TO CONNECT MY PHONE BY THE PLUG I CANNOT FIND PANDORA OR INTERNET RADIO ON THE CAR DEALER DID NOT SHOW ME THESE ITEMS PLUG THAT CAME WITH THE CAR WAS FOR A OLD STYLE IPOD SO HAD TO GO BACK AND GET THE CORRECT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAVE DIFFICULTY WIH UNDERSTANDING VOICE ADDRESS ITS DISAPPOINTING
NAVIGATION WOULD LIKE THE NAME OF THE ROAD THAT CAR IS ON TO BE SHOWN ON SCREEN RADIO WOULD LIKE EASIER METHOD OF SEEING NAME OF SONG PLAYING ON THE RADIO CURRENT METHOD REQUIRES TAKING EYES OFF THE ROAD
THE SPEAKERS ARE OKAY NOT WHAT I D EXPECT FROM A HIGH END CAR ALSO WHY ARE THERE NO EQUALIZER ADJUSTMENTS ON THE VEHICLE THE SUBWOOFER IS ALSO VERY OVERPOWERING
COMPARED TO YEAR MODEL THE CURRENT NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS WAY TOO COMPLEX AND MOST FEATURES ARE TOO DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING
NAVIGATION SCREEN SLIGHTLY TOO SMALL
ADDITION OF TOUCHSCREEN CONTROL
THE PHONE SYSTEM IS HARD TO NEGOTIATE WHILE DRIVING
THE AUDIO QUALITY WHEN USING BLUETOOTH IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR AND THE LISTENER OCCASIONALLY SAYS THEY CAN T HEAR ME
NAVIGATION ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE CITY SUBURBS DOES NOT GO THE BEST ROUTE OR IT TAKES YOU THE WRONG WAY DOESN T SEEM TO BE UPDATED OR KNOW BEST ROUTES
THE CAR DID NOT COME WITH SATELLITE RADIO OPTION OTHER MISSED GADGET IN MY DEAL THE SALES PERSON NEVER MENTIONED TO ME THAT IT WAS NOT INCLUDED I USED TO HAVE THIS GADGET IN MY FORMER CAR WAY LESS EXPENSIVE CAR WITH WAY MORE FEATURES
WHEN YOU CONNECT YOUR PHONE OR IPOD VIA WIRELESS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT THROUGH THE CAR IT IS UNSAFE TO HAVE TO GRAB YOUR PHONE TO MANAGE YOUR PLAYLIST ETC
NAVIGATION SHOULD WORK FASTER IN CALCULATING INFO & SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE
COULD HAVE HEARING AID CONNECTIVITY MORE OLDER PEOPLE WILL BE HEARING IMPAIRED
VOICE RECOGNITION ACCURACY AND IT SHOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO CANCEL OR PAUSE NAVIGATION THE SIDEBAR MENU ON THE MAP IS CONVOLUTED
BETTER SOUND QUALITY FROM SPEAKERS
IPHONE BLUETOOTH THAT ENABLES TEXT MESSAGING EMAIL CALENDAR
STORING RADIO STATIONS AND TUNING THE FM RADIO IS UNINTUITIVE
THE NAVIGATION SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT SIDE OF THE STREET YOUR DESTINATION IS I TURN OFF THE AUDIO AND JUST LOOK AT THE HEADS UP DISPLAY IT SHOULD HAVE AN ARROW OR STATE WHAT SIDE OF THE STREET ITS ON SPEAKERS ARE NOT THAT GREAT HAVE TO TURN UP
ENTERING DESIRED DESTINATION IN NAVIGATION
DO NOT HAVE VOICE COMMAND ALTHOUGH THE BUTTON IS VISIBLE AND MY PHONE DOES NOT ALWAYS CONNECT
IT MUST HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ITS UNACCEPTABLE THST ITS NOT AVAILABLE
THERE IS NO USB PORT AND NO AUXILARY PORT THERE IS ALSO NO PHONE INTEGRATION FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY
BLUETOOTH TAKES TO LONG TO CONNECT
THE SCREEN IS PERMANENTLY IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION TIME CONSUMING VOICE RECOGNITION TRAINING
OLD X5 ALLOWED ME TO HAVE FAVORITES LIST ON CONTACT LIST FIND IT A BIT TEDIOUS TO PLACE A CALL IN NEW 3 SERIES
VOLUME MUST TURNED UP VERY HIGH WHEN USING CELL PHONE FOR MUSIC
THE KNOB IS DIFFICULT TO USE NOT INTUITIVE ALSO THE ICONS ON THE SIDE OF THE MAP ARE NOT UNDERSTANDABLE
POI TRAFFIC NOT USER FRIENDLY
MAP SHOWS WHERE YOU ARE BUT YOU CAN T MOVE IT TO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO ANTICIPATE OR EXPLORE FURTHER DOWN IN THE ROUTING
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION MAKES FOR SAFER FOCUSED DRIVING
IDRIVE HARD TO USE WHY NOT USING A TOUCH SCREEN
NAV SYS IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME TO USE NEED TO TAKE A LESSON FROM THE JAPANESE AS THEIR CARS ARE VERY EASY TO USE
SIMPLIFY DOWNLOAD OF MUSIC TO HARDDRIVE
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT REALLY WORK AS ADVERTISED DUE TO ROAD NOISE GOOGLE OR APPLE VOICE RECOGNITION WORKS MUCH BETTER
NAVIGATOR HAS TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING VOICE COMMAND
AS STATED BEFORE OPERATING THE NAV SYSTEM US TIME CONSUMING AND SLOW
FIRSTLY THE DISPLAY OF THE RADIO SHOWING A PICTURE OF THE ARTIST OR ALBUM COVER IS STUPID IT LOOKS CHEAP ITS NOT NECESSARILY WHAT A GROWN UP PERSON NEEDS TO SEE SECONDLY WHEN YOUR DRIVING AND PUT IN A CD AND DECIDE TO STORE IT YOU MUST KEEP IT
VOICE RECOGNITION IS THE WEAKEST LINK SO PHONE CALLS AND NAV ENTRIES ARE MADE THROUGH THE IDRIVE ONLY HAD THE CAR 3 MONTHS SO STILL EXPERIMENTING SURVEY IS HERE TOO SOON I D LIKE HAVE BETTER CONNECTIVITY TO MY IPHONE WHICH I USE EVERYDAY AND
SPEAKER PHONE IS AWFUL
USING THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM SHOULD BE AS INTUITIVE AS USING A SMART PHONE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM OPERATES POORLY AT TIMES MAPS ARE NOT UP TO DATE EITHER
I WOULD LOVE IT IF THE SATELLITE RADIO DISPLAY SCROLLED THROUGH THE STATION NAME ARTIST AND SONG TITLE
I NEED TO CONFIRM IF I HAVE VOICE CONTROL THERE IS A BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL HAVEN T SEEN IT WORK
AUDIO QUALITY OF HANDS FREE PHONE
SOUND IS LACKING THAT DEEP BASS SOUND NAVIGATION SHOULD HAVE TOUCH SCREEN TO ZOOM IN OR OUT AND A REPEAT BUTTON THE SCREEN IN CASE YOU NEED TO HEAR THE DIRECTIONS AGAIN
AUDIO SYSTEM LOOK OLD CHEAP ANTIQUE TRADITIONAL
HAVING TROUBLE CONNECTING TO MY PANDORA
THE REAR CAMERA IS SLUGGISH AT TIMES AND THE INTERFACE TO GO FROM SAT TO AN APP LIKE SPOTIFY STILL NEEDS REFINEMENT
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE EASIER TO USE SOMETIMES DOESN T UNDERSTAND MY COMMANDS
MAP SHOULD SHOW THE STREET YOUR ON MORE PROMINENTLY SEE LEXUS
HARD TO USE NAVIGATION RARELY USE IT DUE TO THAT
AUDIO CONTROLS ARE VERY RETRO AND OLD LOOKING NOT MODERN AND NO TOUCH SCREEN LOOKS LIKE A 70S CAR
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TOO DIFFICULT TO SET UP IT WORKS WELL AFTER THAT I LIKE THE LARGE SCREEN AND VOICE CONTROL OF ZOOM LEVEL
VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
VOICE RECOGNITION IS WEIRDLY AWFUL HOW CAN IT BE THAT BMW DID SUCH A BAD JOB ON THIS IDRIVE CONTROLS ARE HORRIBLY CONFUSING THAT WHOLE SYSTEMS IS BADLY IN NEED OF REDESIGN
VOICE RECOGNITION ALSO THE USB PORT IN THE GLOVE BOX DOES NOT WORK TO UPLOAD MUSIC
THE RADIO DISPLAY IS HARD TO SEE EASILY DEFINITELY CANNOT SEE WHILE DRIVING WHICH MAKES IT HARD TO SEE WHO IS CALLING WHEN YOU ARE USING HANDSFREE OR SEE WHAT RADIO STATION
AUDIO THE AUX CABLE CONNECTION HAS A CONTINUOUS SQUEELING SOUND AND THE AUX CABLE DOES NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH OTHER DEVICES BUT THE BMW
PAIRING IS INCONSISTENT WITH NEW IPHONE
THE FEATURES OF THE RADIO CONTROLS ARE NOT INTUITIVE IT S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT CAN BE CHANGED AND HOW TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS
FM RADIO RECEPTION IS MARGINAL AS TO RANGE
STEERING CONTROLS ARE CONFUSING TO USE
VOICE CONTROL SHOULD BE WORKING PROPERLY
SLIGHTLY LARGER NAVIGATION DISPLAY WOULD BE NICE
WHEN I CONNECT MY IPHONE AND USE SPOTTILY THE CAR DOESN T ALWAYS RESPOND TO THE FORWARD BACK OF SONGS AND I HAVE TO GET BACK ON MY PHONE TO FORWARD TO THE NEXT SONG SOMETIMES IT WORKS AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN T VERY GLITCHY
MAKE IT EASIER TO SELECT RADIO STATIONS PUT RADIO CONTROLS ON LEFT SIDE OF STEERING COLUMN I DON T LIKE THE ROLLER CONTROL PREFER BUTTONS
I WOULD LIKE IF THEY DIDN T PACKAGE THEIR OPTIONS I DID NOT WANT NAVIGATION BUT WOULD HAVE LIKED SOME OF THE OPTIONS THAT WERE PART OF A NAVIGATION PACKAGE
IT SEEMS BLUETOOTH IS MORE DIFFICULT TO USE AND IS NOT AS INTUITIVE AS OUR PREVIOUS ASIAN MADE VEHICLE WHERE THE ELECTRONICS SEEMED TO BE MORE USEFUL THAN BMW ELECTRONICS
USER INTERFACE IS POOR BMW SHOULD ADOPT APPLE S CAR PLAY AND JUST SCRAP THEIR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SYSTEM
GET RID OF THE DIAL TOO COMPLICATED HAVE TOUCH SCREEN INSTEAD
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS WEAKEST POINT OF CAR
I THINK IT S ALL JUST CONFUSING I DID READ SOME OF THE OWNER S MANUAL REGARDING THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND I DID LEARN SOME TIPS FROM THAT BUT IT S STILL CONFUSING OVERALL
STEP BY STEP ROUTE DIRECTIONS CAN ONLY BE SEEN AT THE START OF A ROUTE IT WOULD BE GOOD TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE NEXT TURNS CONTINUALLY THE TIMING OF TELLING WHERE THE DESTINATION RIGHT SIDE OR LEFT SIDE OF THE ROAD SHOULD BE EARLIER
SIMPLER MORE COMPLETE AND SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF SOURCES ACCESS AND CONTROLS QUESTION THE VALUE OF SIRIUS GOING FORWARD MOST CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCESS TO STREAMING INTERNET OR OTHER PAID SOURCES WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS CONTROL EASILY WHILE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND DOES NOT PROVIDE RELIABLE DIRECTIONS
DON T HAVE NAVIGATION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOMETIMES DOES NOT ALLOW FOR INPUT OF ACTUAL STREET ADDRESS IT WILL FORCE YOU TO SELECT A RANGE OF   S E G 3000 3700 NW ABBOTT STREET AND TOTALLY GETS LOST MORE THAN ONCE
USING THE AUDIO SYSTEM MANUALLY DISTRACTS THE DRIVER MORE OPTIONS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL OR VOICE ACTIVATION WOULD HELP ALSO A LESS CONFUSING AUDIO AND COMMUNICATION MENU WOULD HELP
REMEMBER WHAT I WAS DOING WITH THE AUDIO SYSTEM WHEN I STOP THE VEHICLE AND RE ENTER I FIND I M NOT DOING SOMETHING CORRECTLY BECAUSE I NEVER KNOW WHAT I M GOING TO BE HEARING WHEN I GET IN THE VEHICLE
BEST SOUNDING AUDIO SYSTEM
THE DAMPING OF VOLUME WHEN CHANGING BETWEEN RADIO PRESETS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE TOO WELL THOUGHT THROUGH FEATURES TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT DIDN T EXIST IN THE FIRST PLACE IT S CLOYING AND BOTHERSOME
PLEASE OFFER WAZE IT S 10 TIMES BETTER THAN THE BMW NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR TRAFFIC AND POLICE
INTEGRATION WITH IPHONE SHOULD BE IMPROVED
I DON T FIND FAULT WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I USE MAPS TO NAVIGATE THROUGH MY IPHONE WHICH DISPLAYS ON THE BMW SCREEN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE AT ALL A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT FOR SUCH AN EXPENSIVE VEHICLE
ENTERING DESTINATIONS FOR NAVIGATION
VOICE COMMAND RECOGNIZTION
THE MAP AND NAVIGATION ARE TERRIBLE WHEN COMPARED TO WHAT IS AVAILABLE THROUGH GOOGLE WAZE ETC
IT JU ST NEEDS TO BE MORE SENSITIVE TO VOICE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE THE MAP ALONE LOOKS GOOD AND IS ACCURATE BUT THE ROUTE SETTING SYSTEM IS WAY OUT OF SYNC I CAN GET BETTER RESULTS ON A GARMIN SYSTEM ALSO MY WIFE HAS PLUGGED IN R
VOICE RECOGNITION RARELY WORKS AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A CHEAT SHEET OF COMMANDS THAT COMES UP ON SCREEN
SOUND COULD BE IMPROVE FOR QUALITY NAVIGATION IS NOT FRIENDLY USER ESPECIALLY FOR A REALTOR THAT NEEDS TO ENTER MULTIPLE LOCATIONS
PLACE BUTTON ON STEERING WHEEL TO ADVANCE TO NEXT STATION OR SONG ON EXTERNAL DEVICE MEMORY PUSH BUTTONS EASIER TO FIND WITH FINGERS WITHOUT TAKING EYES OFF ROAD
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS QUITE BAD IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE OUR INPUT WE HAVE A NEUTRAL ACCENT IT NEVER SEEMS TO CORRECTLY IDENTIFY ADDRESSES OR EVEN CITIES STATES IT S SO BAD THAT WE DON T USE IT ANY MORE VOICE RECOGNITION MY ACUR
NAVIGATION MUST BE IMPROVED CONSIDER TOUCH SCREEN AS WELL MULTIPLE LANE VIEW PER ONE ROAD TO SHOW TRAFFIC MUST BE CHANGED TO ONE LANE VIEW PER ONE ROAD IT IS EXTREMELY CONFUSING AND IT MAKES THE MAP VERY COMPLEX TO SEE
FRANKLY WE DON T USE IT MUCH OTHER THAN THE RADIO GIVEN THAT WE AREN T INTO DISTRACTED DRIVING THERE S LITTLE NEED TO THE NAV SYSTEM MIGHT BE USEFUL IF WE HAD MORE NEED OF IT BUT HAVEN T IN ANY VEHICLE WE VE HAD IT IN THE VALUE OF THE SCREEN
BMW STATES THAT THEY ARE COMPATIBLE WITH IOS 7 FOR A VEHICLE IOS 7 IS OVER A YEAR OLD BMW NEEDS TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY OR HAVE A FIRMWARE UPGRADE FEATURE TO CORRECT PROBLEMS LIKE BLUETOOTH STREAMING MUSIC
WHEN YOU TRY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS OF NAVIGATION IT KICKS YOU OUT FROM CURRENT GUIDANCE I WISH IT STAYS WITH THE CURRENT GUIDANCE
NAVIGATION ADDRESS NOT AVAILABLE AT TIMES
VOICE COMMAND IS FRUSTRATING TO INPUT
DISPLAY SCREEN IS AMAZING VOICE RECOGNITION IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS
THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE THERE ARE TOO MANY OCCASIONS OF A WILDLY INCORRECT READBACK OF WHAT I WAS REQUESTING
ON THE NAVIGATION I HATE THAT THE ADDRESS DISAPPEARS ONCE YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TRIP SO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE SCREEN TO FIND IT ONCE YOU ARRIVE
EVEN WITH THE HARMON K SPEAKERS IN THE CAR THE AUDIO SEEMS A BIT WASHED OUT AND THE BASS THAT I GREW TO EXPECT WITH BOSE IN PREVIOUS VEHICLES JUST IS NO MORE I LOVE THE CAR BUT WOULD REALLY LOVE IT IF BMW WOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON GETTING THE SOUNDS
FRUSTRATIONS WITH HUMAN INTERFACE THERE ARE SIMPLY TOO MANY STEPS REQUIRED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE MENU CONTROLS
SOMETIMES THE VOICE ACTIVATION DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY
USB PORT SHOULD BE MORE POWERFUL TO CHARGE PHONE FASTER
I AM NOT A HUGE FAN OF HOW THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOOKS WHEN I HAVE THE GUIDANCE ON I PREFER TO USE THE PERSPECTIVE VIEW I FIND IT TO LOOK A BIT BUSY I MUCH PREFERRED THE NAV SYSTEM IN MY BMW
NAV SYSTEM MOST SIMILAR VEHICLES EG ACURA LEXUS ETC ALLOW NAVIGATION TO RESTAURANTS BUSINESSES ETC BY PHONE NUMBER BMW ALONE DOES NOT HAVE THIS OPTION A GRAVE DEFICIENCY I HAVE COMMUNICATED THIS TO BMW FREQUENTLY TO NO AVAIL OR EVEN RESPONSE
MY ONLY PROBLEMS ARE 1 THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK EVERY TIME AND NEEDS TO BE TURNED OFF AND ON AGAIN 2 NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT ALWAYS TAKE THE FASTEST ROUTE
VOICE COMMANDS WORK ON IT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT VERY GOOD
HARD TO NAVIGATE THE SATELLITE RADIO TO GET TO THE STATIONS YOU LIKE AND HARD OR ARE YOUR FAVORITES AND HARD TO BROWSE STATIONS
LOVE THE RADIO BUT AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE NAVIGATION ALSO CAN NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE INTERNET BMW CONNECT
STEREO SYSTEM ALTHOUGH JUST THE BASIC NON UPGRADED VERSION IS WONDERFUL �ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE CAR THAT SAID IT IS ROUGH THAT THE SYSTEM WILL NOT DISPLAY THE RADIO STATION NAME AND FREQUENCY CONSISTENTLY IN SOME OF THE DISPLAYS IF
ENTERING ADDRESSES INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE I JUST USE MY IPHONE AND CALL IT A DAY MY LAST X5 HAD A SOMEWHAT BETTER UI FOR ENTERING ADDRESSES
THE SPEAKER QUALITY COULD BE BETTER FROM THE FACTORY THE SATELLITE RADIO QUALITY IS TERRIBLE ALL OTHER FUNCTIONS SOUND OK
LOWER THE COST TOO MUCH MONEY FOR A SYSTEM THAT GENERALLY DOES NOT SOUND BETTER THAN A BOSE GM SYSTEM AND ADD A DIFFERENT AMBIENT BACKGROUND LIGHT VERY BORING RED RED AND MORE RED
EASE OF INPUT FOR NAVIGATION AND SEARCH CAPABILITY OF AUDIO SYSTEM REFINED
BETTER EASIER MORE CAPABLE CONNECTIVITY WITH IPHONE
I HAVEN T REALLY TAKEN THE TIME YET TO BECOME FLUENT IN USE OF VOICE COMMAND FEATURES
I HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY CONNECTING MY PHONE USING THE USB PORT
IMPROVE ON CELL PHONE BLUETOOTH LAG WHEN FIRST CONNECTING AN ONGOING PHONE CALL TAKES A SOLID 5 SECONDS TO GET THE CALL TRANSFERRED RADIO NAVIGATION NEEDS TO BE MORE INTUITIVE IT IS NOT BAD ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT I LOVE THE ABILITY TO
POOR CHOICE TO MOVE AWAY FROM BOSE
THE BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTION PUSH THE DRIVER TO SET THE VOLUME TO THE MAX TO AVOID THIS ISSUE YOU NEED TO CONNECT YOUR PHONE VIA USB WHICH IS A REAL WAKE UP CALL WHEN YOU SWITCH BACK TO THE NORMAL RADIO
OVERALL SOUND QUALITY CONNECTIVITY TO INTERNET RADIO MUSIC APPS SPOTIFY IN PARTICULAR MORE APPS
TOUCH CONTROLS ARE SOMETIMES NOT USER FRIENDLY IT WOULD BE NICE FOR PASSENGER TO USE NAVIGATION WHILE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION RATHER THAN HAVING TO PULL OVER
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CHALLENGING TO USES
RADIO SOUND QUALITY OF STOCK SYSTEM COULD BE ENHANCED SOUND SYSTEM SPEAKERS IN THE CAR ARE BELOW AVERAGE I LIKE TO LISTEN TO THE RADIO   CD WHILE DRIVING BETTER SOUND SYSTEM IN MY PREVIOUS CAR   TOYOTA CELICA
IT IS CONFUSING TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DON T USE IT ENOUGH TO BE THAT FAMILIAR WITH IT
THIS VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE A HIGHER QUALITY AUDIO SYSTEM AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT
THE AFOREMENTIONED CONNECTIVITY ISSUES OF BLUETOOTH
VOICE COMMAND FEATURE
HD RADIO IS TERRIBLE
EXTREMELY POOR INTERFACE WITH APPLE DEVICES EXTREMELY DISTRACTING NEAR UNUSABLE UI NOT DESIGNED WITH SAFETY IN MIND POOR SOUND QUALITY PARTICULARLY FOR AN UPGRADED STEREO SYSTEM
SOFTWARE COMPATABILITY WITH APPLE IPHONE 6+
ACCURACY OF RTT & NAVIGATION TOO OFTEN DOES NOT USE AN EFFECTIVE ROUTE TO DESTINATION READING OF INCOMING TEXTS IS VERY INCONSISTENT OFTEN DOES NOT RECOGNIZE & READ AN INCOMING TEXT TO ME
I WISH THE VEHICLE HAD A TOUCH SCREEN I AM SHOCKED IT DOES NOT HAVE ONE
CONNECTION VIA BLUETOOTH IS POOR AND AFFECTS SOUND QUALITY NEEDS TO BE CLEARER ALSO VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE A USB CONNECTION PORT
NAVAGATION DOES NOT GIVE U OPITIONS AS TO ADDRESS CITY AND STATE WHAT EVER IT THINKS U SAID IT DOESNOT GIVE U OPITIONS AND AT THAT PT U HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN OR SOMETIMES MULTIPLY TIMES TO GET DIRECTIONS IT TAKES TO MUCH OF A PERSONS TIME
TO COMPLICATED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE IMPROVED SO THAT I WILL NOT BE DIRECTED TO THE WRONG ALTERNATE ROUTE IN MY CASE IT WAS AN UNPAVED DIRT ROAD AFTER REVIEWING THE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT REPORT BY THE SOFTWARE
BETTER QUALITY FACTORY SPEAKERS BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN VERBALLY SPEAKING AN ADDRESS TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BETTER VOICE GUIDANCE COMPUTERIZED VOICE
I FIND IT AWKWARD TO USE THE VOICE ACTIVATED SYSTEM MAYBE BECAUSE I DON T DO IT ENOUGH
MMI MENU STRUCTURE IS NOT INTUITIVE AND BURIES FUNCTIONALITY UNDER NUMEROUS LAYERS OF MENUS HARD TO USE ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING
AUDIO SYSTEM DIRECTORY LISTING FUNCTION PLAYLIST ETC
THE JUKEBOX DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO UPLOAD MOST IF NOT ALL CDS THIS HAS BEEN A REAL HASSLE AND I FRANKLY DON T UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THE JUKEBOX UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
SOUND SYSTEM AND A NORMAL HOOK UP FOR AUXILIARY OTHER THAN IPOD CONNECTOR
USING DATA FROM GOOGLE TRAFFIC VOICE RECOGNITION FEELS SLOW AND UNINTELLIGENT INABILITY TO MANUALLY REQUEST A ROUTE CHANGE IS FRUSTRATING SYSTEM BOOTS UP SLOWLY AND FREEZES AT TIMES
USE OF VOICE ACTIVATED FEATURES
THE BOSE SOUND SYSTEM IS NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED
THE CONNECTION FOR THE IPOD IS NOT FIRST CLASS IT IS FUNKY CANNOT JUST DO A STRAIGHT CONNECTION THIS IS NOT AUDI QUALITY
THE VEHICLE NAVIGATION NEEDS SOME WORK TO MAKE EASIER TO USE AGAIN I FEEL THAT IT WAS MADE MORE COMPLICATED IN MY S5 VS MY A5 CANCELING THE NAVIGATION GUIDANCE WAS EASIER ENTERING AN ADDRESS WAS EASIER ETC USING THE VOICE COMMANDS
DO USE NOR NEED NAVIGATION SYSTEM I HAVE A SMART PHONE THAT DOES IT
AUTOMATIC BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY COULD BE IMPROVED ONCE THE CONNECTION IS ESTABLISHED I SHOULDN T HAVE TO CHANGE IT MANUALLY BACK TO MY IPHONE ONCE MY WIFE HAS USED THE VEHICLE AND HAD TO CHANGE THE VEHICLE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO HER IPHONE I
BEING ABLE TO SELECT A SIRIUS CHANNEL BY NUMBER USING VOICE COMMANDS BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO DISPLAY IN SIRIUS LISTING NUMBER CHANNEL CAN CURRENTLY DO THIS ARTIST CAN T DO THIS BMW CAN OR SONG TITLE AGAIN CAN T CURRENTLY DO THIS
THE NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND IS NOT INTUITIVE I HAVE EVEN WATCHED THE ONLINE VIDEOS ON HOW TO WORK IT AND STILL CANNOT GET IT TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY
MAP COULD BE BETTER IN SHOWING CURRENT STREET
HOW TO USE VOICE RECOGNITION WAS NEVER EXPLAINED AND THE MANUAL IS CONFUSING
TOO MANY OPTIONS HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO ENTER INFO FOR NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T ALWAYS RECOGNIZE DESTINATION
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE INFORMATION DISPLAY IS ANNOYING IT ALWAYS DEFAULTS TO A LIST OF RADIO CHANNELS I WOULD PREFER TO BE ABLE TO SELECT WHICH DISPLAY IS DEFAULT THE PHONE BOOK IS VERY ANNOYING THE SYSTEM IMPORTS VIA BLUETOOTH YOUR PHONE BOOK IT IS VERY DIFF

THE HANDS FREE PHONE FEATURE PEOPLE I AM TALKING TO SAY I SOUND LIKE I AM FAR AWAY OR IN A TUNNEL
CONTROLS COULD BE EASIER OFTEN TOO MANY STEPS TO COMPLETE A COMMAND VOICE RECOGNITION PROBLEMATIC INTERNET CONNECTION OFTEN SLOWER THAN EXPECTED
FIX VOICE RECOGNITION
THERE S NO TOUCH SCREEN AND THE SCREEN IS RATHER SMALL COMPARED TO AMERICAN VEHICLES ALTHOUGH THE MMI ISN T BAD TAKE A LOOK AT FORD S NAV RADIO BY SONY IT S LEAGUES ABOVE AUDI IN ALL WAYS
NAV NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE CAN T FIND SIMPLE PLACES THAT THE PHONE CAN
MANUAL INPUT OF LOCATION FOR NAVIGATION VOICE CONTROL WORKS GREAT
THE BAND AND OLUFSON OPTIONAL SYSTEM IS THE MANUFACTURER S GIMMICK WHICH IS NOT WORTH FOR THE MONEY IT S MUCH INFERIOR THAN THE HARMAN KARDON SYSTEM ON MY MERCEDES THE QUALITY OF SOUND IS NO BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS BMW 335 BASIC SYSTEM
HAVE A VERY HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING COMMANDS ON BOTH NAVIGATION AND CALLING HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF SEVERAL TIMES OR HAVE TO STOP VEHICLE TO MANUALLY FIND DESTINATION OR HAVE TO USE CELL PHONE AND NOT USE BLUETOOTH FROM VEHICLE
ADD ABILITY TO ACCESS EMAIL LIKE BMW HAS IMPROVE INTUITIVE VOICE COMMANDS
I AM AN OLDER DRIVER AND THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS STILL OUT OF MY LEAGUE I PLAN TO GET USED TO IT AND USE IT TO ITS FULL CAPACITY
WISH I COULD START PANDORA FROM THE CAR EASIER WITHOUT HAVING TO PULL OUT MY PHONE
AS MENTIONED FOR THE MONEY WE SPENT I THINK THAT THE TECH AROUND THE IPOD CONNECTIVITY IS POOR WHO WANTS TO LEAN OVER TO THE GLOVE
VOICE RECOGNITION ABILITY
I EXPECTED BETTER QUALITY SOUND FROM THE BOSE SYSTEM
THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK AND CANNOT BE FIXED MY SALESMAN AND SERVICE GUY TOLD ME VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T WORK FOR THEM EITHER ALSO THE GPS MAPS ARE UNUSABLE THEY ARE PERFECT IN MY OLDER A6
I LIKED SEEING THE MAP ALL THE TIME WHILE DRIVING AS PART OF THE HOME SCREEN NEW SET UP ONLY GIVES A COMPASS AND STREET NAME
I DON T CARE FOR THE TOUCH SCREEN PREFER CONTROL LEVERS KNOBS THE TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM SEEMS DISTRACTING TO ME
MORE FLEXIBILITY IN ADJUSTING BASS TREBLE GRAPHIC EQUALIZER WOULD BE HELPFUL
LOCATION OF TOUCH SCREEN BUTTONS TOO CLOSE TO PERIMETER OF SCREEN
SET UP OF CELL PHONE
THE OVERALL INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM IS DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING COULD BE MADE EASIER TO USE AM GRADUALLY GETTING USED TO IT
I USE AN IPHONE SO I AM NOT ABLE TO USE THE SYNC TEXT SERVICES I WANT SYNC TO BE FULLY COMPATIBLE AND INTERACTIVE WITH AN IPHONE SIRI I HAVE USED THE CURRENT UCONNECT SYSTEM FROM JEEP I LIKE THAT UCONNECT HAS A DEDICATED TRAFFIC WEATHER CHANN
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND ME AND COMMANDS ARE TOO LIMITED
HAVE TROUBLE USING THE AUDIO NAVIGATION IT PICKS THE WRONG ADDRESS A LOT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT PICK THE BEST ROUTE SEEMS TO AVOID INTERSTATES ON LONG TRIPS WHICH I PREFER THE ROUTES SELECTED BY NAVIGATION ARE NOT THE ROUTES I WOULD SELECT FROM A MAP OR COMPUTER
I M NOT CLEAR IF MY CAR HAS HD RADIO AND IF IT DOES IT IS NOT WORKING
THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR AUDIO COULD BE BETTER FREQUENTLY IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE SONG NAMES OR ARTISTS THAT I ASK FOR
HAVE NOT FIGURED THE NAVIGATION
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T ALWAYS HERE THE CORRECT WORDS WHEN I AM TALKING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE MORE LIKE MAPS APP ON IPHONE WHICH ALLOWS USER TO EXPAND OR REDUCE MAP AREA SO THE USER CAN SEE A LARGE AREA IF DESIRED
VOICE RECOGNITION ON PHONE DOES NOT WORK WELL
BIGGEST DIFFICULTY IS NAVIGATION GETTING ADDRESS INFO CORRECTLY WHEN GIVEN VERBALLY HAVE TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE SYSTEM GETS IT CORRECT OR IS ABLE TO LOCATE CORRECT ADDRESS
BETTER NAV SYSTEM SOUND IS NOT UP TO PAR WITH COMPARABLE VEHICLES
YOU VE MADE IT MORE COMPLICATED I HAVE TO PRESS NUMEROUS BUTTONS TO MAKE A PHONE CALL FROM MY PHONE BOOK WHERE PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE SYSTEM HAD THE PHONE BOOK BROKEN DOWN TO MORE SEGMENTS AND EASIER QUICKER TO GET WHERE I WANT TO GO
THE OLD NAV SYSTEM USED TO LET YOU PICK THE ROUTE YOU WANTED IE FASTER OR SHORTER THE NEW NAV SYSTEM HAS NO OPTIONS
HARD TO EXIT OUT OF PHONE SYNC
ITS HAND FREE WHILE I DRIVE SO THERE IS NO DISTRACTIONS
MORE FAVORITE SAT CHANNEL DISPLAYED
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESNT WORK WELL
I WISH THE SOUND SYSTEM WAS BETTER WHEN PLAYING MUSIC AND MORE EYE APPEALING SYNC IS AWESOME
TOUCHSCREEN NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
I HAVEN T HAD TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE ENTIRE COMMUNICATION AUDIO SYSTEM SO I HESITATE TO OFFER AN OPINION AT THIS TIME THE 7 RATING SHOULD NOT WEIGHTED ACCORDINGLY LOOKING FORWARD TO MASTERING THE VOICE COMMANDS
THE SYNC VOICE RECOGNITION
SOUND FOR HANDS FREE PHONE
NOT HAVING TO TAKE THE TIME TO INDEX THE IPOD EACH TIME I PLUG IT IN IT USUALLY TAKES A COUPLE MINUTES TO DO THIS BEFORE I CAN USE VOICE COMMANDS
QUICKER NAVIGATION ADJUSTMENTS ON THE FLY WHILE MOVING IN TRAFFIC
DIFFICULT FOR THE SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND VOICE COMMANDS
EASY ACCESS TO SATELLITE RADIO STATIONS
DON T DISABLE THE KEYBOARD WHILE MOVING
I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE ROTARY KNOBS INSTEAD OF THE TOUCHSCREEN FOR THE AUDIO CONTROLS IT IS DANGEROUS IN MY OPINION TO HAVE TO LOOK DOWN AT THE SCREEN AWAY FROM THE ROAD
SCREEN IS JUMBLED XM INTERFACE A LITTLE CONFUSING TO FIND STATIONS
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE A BUILT IN NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM I CURRENTLY USE MY PHONE
WISH VOICE RECOGNITION WERE A BIT BETTER I HAVE LEARNED HOW THE VOICE RECOGNITION PRONOUNCES CERTAIN CONTACTS VS IT LEARNING HOW I PRONOUNCE THEM
I FAVOR BLUETOOTH AUDIO CONNECTION OVER USB BECAUSE USB TAKES FAR TOO LONG TO RECOGNIZE DEVICE AND INDEX MUSIC THIS MEANS I LOSE OUT ON DISPLAY INFORMATION SUCH AS SONG TITLE ETC AND SOME VOICE COMMANDS
POIS ARE NOT VERY COMPLETE GARMIN UNITS ARE MORE COMPLETE AND EASIER TO USE THERE US NO TRUCK MODE AVAILABLE SO I MUST USE A RAND MCNALLY RV GPS AS WELL TO NAVIGATE WITH MY 5TH WHEEL TRAILER THIS IS FRUSTRATING A TRUCK OPTION SHOULD BE AVAILAB
BETTER DIRECTIONS TO HOOK UP PHONE OR IPOD
THE INTERCONNECTIVITY BETWEEN MY SAMSUNG GALAXY 5 PHONE AND THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO IS COMPLICATED AND INEFFICIENT I CANT GET IT TO PLAY SMOOTHLY
I FIND THAT WHEN USING THE TOUCH SCREEN MY HAND BRUSHES THE TEMPERATURE CONTROLS LOCATED DIRECTLY BENEATH THE TOUCH SCREEN CHANGING MY SETTINGS IT SURPRISES ME EACH TIME UNTIL I REALIZE I INADVERTENTLY TOUCHED THE CLIMATE CONTROLS
THE SYNC SYSTEM IS COMPLICATED IF BROWSING FOR MUSIC ON A CONNECTED IPOD & THE TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVITY IS A LITTLE UNRESPONSIVE
1 I AM UNABLE TO SWITCH RADIO BANDS AM FM SATELLITE AND OR FUNCTIONS RADIO CD FROM THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS 2 I SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE VOICE COMMANDS TO SWITCH RADIO BANDS AND FUNCTIONS AND STATIONS
DO NOT HAVE ENTERTAINMENT OR NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEMS
BLUETOOTH NOT INTUITIVE UPON FIRST SET UP
THE TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE IS RATHER DULL
THE TRAFFIC INFORMATION IS NOT CURRENT WHICH LEADS TO WRONG DRIVING ROUTES
VOICE RECOGNITION
THE USB JACKS NEED A BETTER AMPLIFIER MUSIC FROM MY MP3 PLAYER IS LACKING VOLUME AND A QUALITY SOUND THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOESN T PICK UP MY VOICE VERY WELL I HAVE TO SPEAK VERY LOUDLY IN ORDER FOR IT TO WORK AND SOMETIMES THAT WON
I WOULD RATHER HAVE PANDORA THAT SIRIUS
VOLUME OF PHONE CALLS WHEN USING BLUETOOTH IS NOT VERY GOOD I TURN IT ALL THE WAY UP AND SOMETIMES IT IS STILL DIFFICULT TO HEAR SO I TEND TO AVOID USING THE FEATURE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY THE NAVIGATION MAP SD CARD FROM FORD AFTER PURCHASE OF THE VEHICLE
SYNC MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO START UP MUSIC WHEN I USE MY IPHONE TO PLAY SPOTIFY BECAUSE IT NEVEER UNDERSTANDS WHAT I SAW AND I THEREFORE HAVE TO SPEND TIME CLICKING THE BUTTONS WHEN I SHOULD BE DRIVING
FAVORITE STATION SELECTION FEELS A LITTLE BULKY AND IS DIFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING LARGER TOUCH SCREEN BUTTONS WOULD BE GREATLY HELPFULL
MORE RESPONSIVE RADIO SELECTION CONTROLS ON TOUCH SCREEN OLD SYSTEMS OFFERED BETTER WEATHER UPDATES THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR PROGRAMMING WHILE UNDER DRIVING OPERATION
I WOULD HAVE LIKED A MORE FULL FEATURED STOCK STEREO SUCH AS SURROUND SOUND AND TOUCH SCREEN
THE ENTERTAINMENT UNIT COULD BE BETTER INTEGRATED WITH PORTABLE DEVICES THERE IS NO APP INTERACTION EX FACEBOOK EMAILS ETC PUSH VIDEO WOULD BE PLEASING BUT MORE SO A BETTER DEFINITION SCREEN IT LOOKS DULL AND DATED AND PERHAPS A REVAMP OF
SYNC IS COMPLICATED TO LEARN SHOULD BE EASIER
MY FIESTA DOES NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM I WISH IT DID HAVE ONE AND INCLUDING ONE WOULD BE A BIG PLUS FOR THE FIESTA IN THE SMALL CAR MARKET
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION HAVING TO WAIT EVERY TIME FOR THE SYSTEM TO SAY PLEASE SAY A COMMAND AND THEN WAIT FOR A TONE SEEM TOO LONG ALSO WHEN MAKING A CALL IF A SAY CALL <PERSON> AT <LOCATION> IT WORKS BUT IF I SAY CALL <PERSON> <LOCATION
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER SOUND QUALITY IN THE HANDS FREE CALLING COULD BE MORE CLEAR
AUDIO SYSTEM IS A LITTLE WEAK ON SOUND QUALITY EXPECTED A LITTLE BETTER SOUND EVEN THOUGH I OPTED NOT TO GET THE UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM
THE DATA ENTRY FOR THE NAV SYSTEM IS AWFUL THE DESIGNER FOR THAT SYSTEM SHOULD BE FLOGGED MAKE IT LIKE ADDRESSING AN ENVELOPE
AVAILABILITY OF SATELLITE RADIO
THE SPEAKER COULD BE PLACED ON THE STEERING WHEEL OR DASH RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER WHEN HANDS FREE OFTEN I HAVE TO PRACTICALLY YELL TO BE HEARD WELL BY THE PERSON I AM CALLING
THE SOUND QUALITY IS SURPRISINGLY AVERAGE I EXPECTED MORE BASS AND SOUND QUALITY THE HD RADIO SHOULD BE STANDARD AND SHOULD INCLUDE THE CD PLAYER
I PERSONALLY DO NOT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN WHEN YOU EXIT YOUR VEHICLE THE DASH AREA LOOKS LIKE A PLAY SCHOOL EVENT TURNING THE KNOB TO SELECT OR CHANGE A STATION IS CLEANER AND SIMPLER
I USE A WINDOWS PHONE AND THERE ARE NO APPLICATIONS SUPPORTED BETWEEN SYNC AND WP8 ONLY IPHONE AND ANDROID SUPPORT FOR THIS PLATFORM WOULD BE THE BIGGEST IMPROVEMENT
MENU NAVIGATION AND INSTRUCTIONS COULD BE SIMPLIFIED
SOUND COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN IMPROVED ON WITH BETTER SPEAKERS DISPLAY IS CHEAP LOOKING NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL WITH AUDIO SYSTEM IN THIS CAR
MAKE VOICE RECOGNITION MORE INTUITIVE AND USER FRIENDLY DON T USE IT CAUSE I CAN T FIGURE IT OUT TAKES TOO MUCH EFFORT TO FIGURE IT OUT
THE MANUAL CONTROLS CAN BE TOUCHY AND TO EASILY SELECT SOMETHING THAT YOU DON T WANT THE MIC FOR THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO DOES NOT PICK UP PASSENGERS VERY WELL
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE A BUSINESS SEARCH ONLY CAN PUT ADDRESSES IN NOT VERY USEFUL IF I HAVE TO LOOK UP ADDRESSES ON ANOTHER DEVICE TO INPUT IN THE NAVIGATION
THE NAVIGATION IS LACKLUSTER BUT OTHER THEN THAT IT GREAT
THE TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE FEELS SLOW COMPARED TO MODERN SMART PHONES AND TABLETS IT FEELS LIKE IT TAKES 1 3 SECONDS FOR THE INTERFACE TO REACT AFTER PRESSING MOST FEATURES
DIFFICULT TO CONNECT MP3 PLAYER
CAN T DOWNLOAD APPS WHY CAN YOU CONNECT YOUR CAR TO WIFI BUT NOT DOWNLOAD APPS TO THE OPERATING SYSTEM SLOW RESPONSE TIME
THERE IS A LAG WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN APPLICATIONS RADIO NAV WEATHER IT S MY ONLY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE SYSTEM
EASE NAVIGATE SCREENS MAYBE ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE YOU HOME PAGES TO FEATURE YOU USE MOST
NEED A BETTER DISPLAY AND ROUTE OPTIONS FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAV IS UNACCEPTABLE THE REST IS FINE NO ISSUES BUT NOT EXCEPTIONAL EITHER COMPARING TO OUR MERCURY MILAN WITH SYNC AND VARIOUS RENTAL CARS
NO CD PLAYER
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS SIGNIFICANT DIFFICULTY LOCATING HOUSE NUMBERS IN MY AREA
WHEN THE VIDEO SCREEN IS DOWN THE DRIVER IS NOT ABLE TO USE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR HUGE SAFETY ISSUE
OVERALL THE MULTIMEDIA TOUCHSCREEN IS A BEAUTIFUL DISPLAY AND WONDERFUL TO USE I DON T LIKE HOW YOU HAVE TO SCROLL ON THE SCREEN TO GET FROM SATELLITE RADIO TO THE BLUETOOTH INPUT THE TWO I USE THE MOST AND TOGGLE BETWEEN VERY ANNOYING IT SHOU
THE SOUND IS MUDDY THE SPEAKERS HAVE LIMITED FREQUENCY RESPONSE THE SUBWOOFER IS FLABBY AND DISTORTED THE HEAD UNIT ITSELF IS COMPLICATED AND CUMBERSOME TO OPERATE
FIND A NEW NAV SYSTEM
IT DOES NOT HAVE SATELLITE RADIO THE CAR WAS ALMOST 40 GRAND BUT DOESN T HAVE SATELLITE RADIO
I CANNOT CONNECT TO INTERNET ISSUE WITH CONNECTIVITY
MY LAST VEHICLE WAS A BUICK AND THEIR SYSTEM WAS SO MUCH BETTER IT WAS SO MUCH LESS CUMBERSOME AND VERY USER FRIENDLY FORD NEEDS TO LOOK TO BUICK AND THEN TRY AND REVAMP THEIR SYSTEM ALSO I LOVE LISTENING TO PANDORA AND SOMETHING SO SIMPLE
THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE CUSTOMIZED BY THE OWNER
SPEAKERS MORE COLORED TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAYS
VERY HARD TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN WHILE DRIVING VERY UNSAFE
BUILT IN VOICE RECOGNITION
STILL UNSURE ABOUT VOICE COMMANDS WOULD VE BEEN NICE TO HAVE A CARD WITH THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE
SIMPLE EASY TO USE TECHNOLOGY FOR PEOPLE THAT DON T LIKE TECHNOLOGY
PROVIDE BETTER SPEAKERS OR ADD MORE SPEAKERS SOUND QUALITY OF A VEHICLE AT THIS PRICE POINT SHOULD BE BETTER WITHOUT SPENDING AN ADDITIONAL 1 000 DOLLARS FOR THE BOSE UPGRADE
NAVIGATION DOES NOT GET DIRECTION CORRECT AND DOES NOT UNDERSTAND STREET ADDRESSES
TRUCK SHOULD HAVE CD PLAYER I HAVE MANY CDS AND NOW CAN NOT PLAY THEM PLAYING MUSIC USING USB IS NOT EASY TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING PANDORA SYSTEM IS COMPLICATED
RESPONSIVENESS WHEN CHANGING APPS AND RADIO CHANNELS COULD BE IMPROVED
ALL GOOD EXCEPT FOR SYNC VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
EASE OF USE OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM I SHOULDN T HAVE TO GO TO THE DEALER FOR AN EXPLANATION I HAVE HAD 4 OTHER CARS WITH NAVIGATION AND USED THE WITH NO PROBLEM
WHAT MY VEHICLE APPEARS TO HAVE IS NEW CONTROL CENTER TECHNOLOGY IN CONJUNCTION WITH OLDER MORE MANUAL CONTROLS WHICH MEANS THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO WAYS TO ACCOMPLISH MOST FUNCTIONS WHILE IT MAY SOUND DESIRABLE TO HAVE MULTIPLE CONTROLS FOR SOME
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DELAY WHEN USING THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO CHANGE PRE SET RADIO CHANNELS
I LIKE THE HANDS FREE PHONE FEATURE BUT I M OLD STYLE AND DO NOT REALLY USE THE ENTERTAINMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS THAT MUCH
ONSTAR IS USING A CELL CARRIER THAT DOES NOT WORK WHERE I LIVE AND WORK THIS IS VERY UNACCEPTABLE I HAVE A GMC TERRAIN THAT WORKS PERFECTLY
WARNING SYSTEM SEEMS TO REPORT ACCIDENTS THAT ARE NOT REALLY THERE ALSO NARROW LANE MESSAGES THAT DON T APPLY
HAVEN T USED THE VOICE CONTROL SYSTEMS OR ON STAR SYSTEMS YET
NAV SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE DIFFICULT TO USE AND NOT VERY ACCURATE
VOLUME OF THE NAVIGATION NARRATIOR
MENU S DRIVE YOU TO MENU S WITH ONLY ONE OPTION THEN YOU HAVE TO SELECT THAT OPTION AGAIN TO GET TO THE SCREEN TO SELECT WHAT OPTION OR FEATURE YOU WANT TWO SCREENS BACK MAKE IT SIMPLE I AM TRYING TO DRIVE REALLY MISS THE CD PLAYER I LIKE AUDIO
IF YOU COULD DISPLAY THE SMARTPHONE SCREEN ON THE DASHBOARD SCREEN THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL ESP WHEN NAVIGATING
MORE MENU CHANGES SO PHONEBOOK DOESN T HAVE TO BE LOADED EVERYTIME THE VEHICLE IS STARTED
NAVIGATION BRINGS THIS RATING DOWN IF I DIDNT INCLUDE THIS IT WOULD BE A 10
NO BUILT IN CD PLAYER GREATLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN TOOK DELIVERY AND LEARNED THAT THE AUDIO SYSTEM DID NOT HAVE A CD PAYER PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE HAD I LEARNED THAT THE AUDIO SYSTEM DID NOT HAVE AN CD PLAYER
USE GOOGLE MAPS
ON STAR DOESN T APPEAR TO HAVE A MAP FEATURE JUST TURN BY TURN MESSAGES
MUSIC FROM IPHONE WILL NOT LIST ARTIST SONGS PLAYING UNLESS PLUGGED INTO USB PORT
NEEDS THE ABILITY TO ADD A POWERED SUBWOOFER BOSE DOES NOT ALLOW IT
THE 7 INCH TOUCH SCREEN AVAILABLE IN THE SLE1 SHOULD BE STANDARD IN THE BASE MODEL GMC SIERRA LD
I CURRENTLY HAVE HUNDREDS OF SONGS ON MY PHONE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY PLAY ARTIST  AND IT PLAYS FROM MY PHONE CURRENTLY ONLY ABLE TO DO THIS IF I HAVE A DEDICATED USB DRIVE ON THE SYSTEM
THE BASIC RADIO DOES NOT HAVE A CD PLAYER THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE
THE TOUCH SCREEN FEATURE IS A LITTLE ANNOYING AS YOU HAVE TO DELIBERATELY TOUCH PRESS THE DESIRED APPLICATION WITH FORCE MUCH MORE SO THAN OF A TOUCH THAN IS REQUIRED USING A IPHONE ETC
NEEDS CD AND WHEEL CONTROLS
HAS A NICE DISPLAY YET MOSTLY IT IS USED TO DISPLAY THE RADIO STATION INFORMATION WHICH IS NOT HIGH VALUE I WOULD EXPECT THAT WHEN HOOKING UP MY IPHONE TO THE USB MINIMALLY THE IPHONE DISPLAY WOULD BE SENT TO THE TRUCK S DISPLAY WHILE OPTIMALL
TOUCH SCREEN IS TOO MUCH TIME AWAY FROM THE ROAD
INTEGRATION WITH IPHONE COULD BE IMPROVED
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT EASY TO USE FOR ME I HAVE A GARMAN I USED IN MY OTHER VEHICLE WHICH IS MORE USER FRIENDLY
CONNECTIVITY TO PANDORA SYSTEM THROUGH MY ANDROID PHONE COULD BE BETTER SOMETIMES IT SAYS IT CANNOT RECOGNIZE THE SOURCE OR SOURCE NOT AVAILABLE
NAVIGATION VOICE CONTROL MAKES ERRORS
ALWAYS INCLUDE AUDIO CONTROL BUTTONS ON STEERING WHEEL IT REALLY ENHANCES SAFETY AND AVOIDS DRIVER DISTRACTION SHOULD BE A BASE PRICE ITEN
I JUST NEED MORE TIME TO LEARN THE MANY STEPS AND PROCESSES TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER FOR ME SEEMS LIKE TO MANY STEPS AND I AM NOT YET WELL VERSED IN VOICE RECOGNITION USE
1 FASTER PROCESSOR IT TAKES WAY TOO LONG TO RESPOND TO MY VOICE COMMANDS AND MY TOUCH SCREEN SELECTIONS 2 REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TOUCHES IT TAKES TO BEGIN NAVIGATING TO AN ADDRESS OR POI 3 ADD STARBUCKS TO THE POI LIST
THE ROUTES THAT THE NAVIGATION PICKS CAN BE RATHER STRANGE AND DIRECTLY CONTRADICTS MY TABLET AND SMARTPHONE THE NAVIGATION SHOULD PEROXIDE MULTIPLE ROUTES TO CHOOSE FROM WHEN YOU ASK FOR DIRECTIONS TO A DESTINATION
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO GET VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION AND BLUETOOTH TO RECOGNIZE MY VOICE
VOICE COMMAND COULD BE BETTER
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRESET XM CHANNELS
LOCATION OF MICROPHONE FOR HANDS FREE USE COULD BE BETTER
THE NAVIGATION IS THE WEAK POINT FOR SURE I HAVE USED IT A FEW TIMES AND THE ROUTES IT HAS PROVIDED WERE COMPLETELY INACCURATE HOPEFULLY GM WILL COME UP WITH AN UPDATE FOR THE NAV SYSTEM I USE THE GPS NAVIGATION ON MY IPHONE STILL IT S MUCH MOR
I THINK FOR THE PRICE POINT OF THE VEHICLE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED INSTEAD OF THE ON STAR NAVIGATION SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED A MAP OF THE AREA YOU ARE IN SO YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO STOP PULL OUT YOUR PHON
I BUMP THE RADIO CONTROLS WHEN I AM TURNING THE STEERING WHEEL THE SWITCHES COULD STICK OUT OF THE STEERING WHEEL LESS
FASTER SOFTWARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND VOICE RECOGNITION BETTER
NAVIGATION SYSTEM MAPS NOT UPDATED OR INCORRECT MAPS WEATHER MAPS DO NOT FOCUS IN CLOSE TO AREA WHEN IN STORMS BEING ABLE TO ZOOM IN CLOSER WOULD BE AN ASSET
CONNECT TO ANDROID VIA USB
THE OUTLETS TO CONNECT A USB CORD DOES NOT WORK
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE BLUETOOTH OR ANY OTHER NAVIGATION SYSTEMS DID NOT KNOW OF VOICE ACT SYSTEMS
UNABLE TO USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEW PART ON ORDER
IT IS FRUSTRATING THAT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION ONE CANNOT USE THE TOUCH SCREEN TO ENTER ROUTES AND OR ADD NEW DEVICES I REALIZE THIS IS A SAFETY FEATURE BUT IF THE VEHICLE IS SO SMART IT SHOULD KNOW SENSE WHEN THERE IS A PASSENGER IN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T HAVE MAP DOESN T UPDATE AUTOMATICALLY WHEN YOU VEER OFF ROUTE AND DOESN T GIVE YOU ALTERNATIVE ROUTE OPTIONS
VOICE RECOGNITION MAKE IT WORK CORRECTLY WE HAVE YET TO GET IT TO WORK WITH NAVIGATION EVERY ADDRESS STREET CITY AND STATE ARE RECOGNIZED INCORRECTLY THE RECOGNITION SYSTEM WORKS WELL ENOUGH FOR THE AUDIO SIDE JUST NOT THE NAVIGATION
REMOVE ONSTAR
WOULD LIKE IT TO BE MORE ACCURATE AND RECOGNIZE VOICE COMMANDS ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS
HEADS UP DISPLAY ON THE FRONT WINDSHIELD
TOUCH SCREEN SUCKS
THE ENTIRE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SUBPAR
SYSTEM NEEDS A BUILT IN SUB INTERNAL NAVIGATION AND A HIGHER VOLUME LEVEL
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS USELESS THE GRAPHIC DETAIL IS NON EXISTANT AND THEREBY THE USEFULNESS OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS COMPROMISED THE WEATHER FEATURE IS GRAPHICALLY USELESS AND VERY POOR THE WEATHER DETAIL IS SO LIMITING THAT YOUR CAR I
VOICE COMMANDS WHEN REQUESTING GUIDANCE
NOT THE BEST TO EVALUATE THESE AREAS USE MY FM RADIO AND MY HANDS FREE PHONE FEATURE BUT DON T HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAVE YET TO USE MY CD PLAYER NEED ANOTHER LESSON HOW ALL THAT WORKS PRETTY MUCH DRIVE MY CAR FROM WORK TO BACK ETC I AM
UNABLE TO DELETE HOME ADDRESS ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAV SYSTEM INPUTS DISABLED WHILE IN MOTION UNLESS USING VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM THAT DOESN T WORK AGGRAVATING NEARLY INFURIATING WHY ARE MY PASSENGERS NOT ALLOWED TO INPUT NAV SYSTEM COMMANDS ADDRESSES
WHEN CONNECTED BLUETOOTH ONLY MAKE CALLS CANNOT STREAM PANDORA STUPID
BRAND NEW EXPENSIVE TRUCK TOOK AT ROAD TRIP TO FLORIDA WHAT DO YOU KNOW THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T WORK CALLED ON STAR THEY RAN A DIAGNOSTICS TEST ANT WHAT DO YOU KNOW WE NEED A NEW ANTENNA WENT TO A ONE DEALERSHIP THEY DIDN T HAVE
THE VOICE CONTROL IS TOO AWFUL TO BE USEFUL SO I DON T EVEN BOTHER TO USE IT IT TAKES A MINUTE OR TWO FOR THE BLUETOOTH TO PAIR AND THE AUDIO DEFAULTS TO SATELLITE AND IF I DON T TURN THE RADIO DOWN BEFORE I TURN OFF THE CAR IT BLASTS THE SATEL
I LIKE THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN THIS CAR
VOICE RECOGNITION COMPATIBILITY WITH PHONES
SYNC IS CUMBERSOME TOO MANY STEPS I WOULD LIKE IT TO RECOGNIZE VERBAL ADDRESSES BETTER LESS SPELLING BY PUSHING LETTERS ON THE SCREEN 2 I KNOW YOU SAY ONE ASPECT BUT EVERY TIME I PLUG IN MY PHONE THE AUDIO SYSTEM STARTS PLAYING THE MUSIC ON
HARD TO USE WHEN DRIVING ALONE WITH A PASSENGER I CAN GIVE INSTRUCTIONS ON USING THE TOUCH SCREEN AS A DRIVER ITS DIFFICULT TO WORK ALL THE FEATURES
NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOCATION INTERFERED WITH VISIBILITY
VOICE CONTROLS
IMPROVE COMMUNICATION WITH TOMTOM THEY HAVE DONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF INTEGRATION IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY HAD COMPLETED IT FOR EXAMPLE IF I TELL IT I WANT TO NAVIGATE IT UNDERSTANDS BUT THEN TELLS ME TO MANUALLY USING THE SCREEN ENTER THE
BETTER SPEAKER PHONE CLARITY
WOULD LIKE BLUETOOTH AUDIO CONNECTIVITY
HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH THE NEW IPHONE NOT SURE THAT IT S VEHICLE RELATED OR IPHONE ISSUES IN THE CONNECTION WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF IT WAS BLUETOOTH ENABLED
NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR DRIVING DIRECTIONS IS DIFFICULT TO SET AND OFTEN DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE RIGHT ADDRESS PHONE HAS TO BE USED FOR DIRECTIONS TRAFFIC LINK VIA SIRIUS RADIO IS NOT GOOD
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO FUNCTION BETTER PHONE PAIRING SHOULD HOLD LONGER THAN 1 2 WEEKS
BLUETOOTH PAIRING
PLAYING MUSIC FROM THUMB DRIVE SHUFFLE FEATURE DOES NOT WORK
THE AUDIO VOLUME FOR THE RADIO IS NOT THE SAME AS THE AUDIO VOLUME FOR THE MP3 FOR THE MP3 THE AUDIO VOLUME HAS TO BE TURNED ALL THE WAY UP FOR MUSIC WITH A WIDE DYNAMIC RANGE SUCH AS CLASSICAL MUSIC IF LISTENING TO ROCK WHICH IS RECORDED LOUD
SEE ABOVE PERHAPS I VE NOT SUFFICIENTLY RESEARCHED THE IPOD CONTROLS CELL PHONE SEEMS FINE
THE AUDIO COMMANDS CAN BE TEDIOUS TO USE SEVERAL TIMES IT HAS MISUNDERSTOOD WHAT I VE SAID AND I VE HAD TO START OVER WHICH IS REALLY FRUSTRATING SOMETIMES IT S EASIER TO USE THE TOUCHSCREEN TO REACH MY COMMAND
THE SIRIUS XM SATELLITE RADIO SEEMS TO TAKE LONGER THAN NORMAL TO ACQUIRE A SIGNAL
USING MY IPOD OR IPHONE MUSIC I FIND IT TEDIOUS AND NOT REALLY POSSIBLE IF I M DRIVING TO CONTINUALLY HAVE TO GO BACK AND FORTH FROM BROWSE TO PLAYLIST TO ARTIST ETC THE SYSTEM KEEPS TAKING ME BACK ALL THE WAY TO THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS
I DON T HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN MY CAR ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE OPTION OF CONNECTING MY PHONE TO THE AUDIO SYSTEM THE PHONE RECOGNITION SHOULD BE ADDRESSED NOT A VERY CLEAN SYSTEM
I HAVE THE UCONNECT 5 0 AND ITS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD THE BIGGEST THING I HAVE NOTICED IS THAT WHEN USING AN IPOD AND MUSIC ART IS LOADING THERE IS A NOTICEABLE LAG NOISE WHILE TRANSFERRING THE ALBUM ART
VOICE RECOGNITION IS SLOW TO RESPOND ONCE COMMAND IS GIVEN VERY LITTLE SUPPORT INSTRUCTIONS ON THE INTERNET
WE DO NOTUSE THE VOICE ACTIVATION FEATURE WE WILL AT A LATER TIME
HAS NO NAVIGATION
EASE OF VOICE CONTROL
BETTER SPEAKERS   BETTER RECEIVERS WITH MORE POWER AND ALL MODELS SHOULD HAVE A CD PLAYER AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT
SOUND QUALITY COULD BE AND SHOULD BE BETTER THERE ISN T ENOUGH BASS OR TREBLE WITH THE SONY SPECKER THE QUALITY OF SOUND IS VERY GENERIC IT COULD BE THE RADIO INSTEAD OF THE SPEAKERS BUT WITH THE SONY NAME THE SOUND IS ONLY AVERAGE
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE BETTER
SOUND IS VERY GOOD REST OF THE CONTROLS ARE AVERAGE TOUCHSCREEN BUTTONS ARE TOO SMALL ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING AND TRYING TO HIT RIGHT BUTTON
BETTER MIC FOR PHONE CALLS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FREQUENTLY FAILS TO FIND SPECIFIC ADDRESSES BY VOICE COMMAND AND YET WHEN YOU DRIVE THERE THE CORRECT STREET INTERSECTION INFORMATION WILL BE DISPLAYED
THE WEATHER MAP IS VERY NICE TO HAVE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND
EASIER MANUAL SET UP OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN CHOOSING AN ADDRESS
SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER AND LOUDER
THE NAVIGATION NEEDS WORK ON THE ROUTING AND MAP COUNTY ROADS
SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE CONNECTION TO MY IPHONE ON OCCASION I HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING CALLS FROM THE PHONE BOOK OR CONTACT LIST I FIND IT EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BY VOICE AND SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO COMM
CORRECT RECOGNITION IS DIFFICULT I HAD NO IDEA I COULD CONTROL OTHER ITEMS BESIDES THE NAVIGATION VIA VOICE MY DEALER NEVER EXPLAINED THE FEATURES
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS MAJOR IMPROVEMENT THIS FORD ESCAPE IS THE 4TH FORD VEHICLE I VE LEASED HAVING MAJOR VOICE RECOGNITION PROBLEMS IT IS TOO FRUSTRATING TO ATTEMPT TO USE THIS FEATURE AS A RESULT THIS FEATURE HAS NO REAL VALUE
THE VOLUME CONTROL ON THE RADIO IS HORRIBLE IT USES UP DOWN MUTE BUTTONS INSTEAD OF A KNOB EVERYONE KNOWS A KNOB WORKS BETTER THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM DOES NOT INCLUDE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR STREAMING AUDIO AS IF THAT WAS EVEN AN OPTION TO
SOUND QUALITY ON PHONE CALLS COULD BE BETTER
IMPROVED LIGHTING FOR USB PORTS
SYNC SERVICE TOO BAD YOU NEED A PHONE TO CONNECT MY DROID PHONE DOES NOT SYNC VIA USB ONLY VIA BLUETOOTH
THE RADIO STATIONS SHOULD PROGRESS TO THE NEXT GROUP WITHIN THE SOURCE SELECTED IN OTHER WORDS AS THE NEXT STATION BUTTON IS PUSHED THE STATIONS PRESETS SHOULD PROGRESS FROM FM1 TO FM2 AND SO ON NOT JUST REPEAT WITHIN FM1
STREAM MUSIC FROM PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH
THE INTERFACE WITH THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE USER DRIVER BOTH THE HAND CONTROLS BUTTONS AND DIALS AND VOICE COMMANDS ARE MORE DISTRACTIONS THAN ASSISTANCE TO A DRIVER
SOUND FROM CELL CALLS PEOPLE COMPLAIN I FADE IN AND OUT AND NOT ABLE TO CONNECT HANDS FREE CAN T DETECT MY VOICE PROPERLY
AUTOMATIC PHONE BOOK UPDATES WITHOUT LOCKING UP THE SYSTEM
BETTER SOUND SYSTEM AND BETTER CONTROLS ON THE DASH OR VIDEO SCREEN
NEED BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR IPHONES
VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS TOO COMPLICATED TO BOTHER WITH LEARNING I NEED AN ONLINE VIDEO TUTORIAL
CLARITY OF BLUETOOTH FOR PEOPLE ON OTHER END OF CALL LISTENING TO ME LOTS OF BACKGRUND NOISE GPS EASIER TO SET ADDRESS MORE ACCURATE POI
HANDS FREE PHONE SYSTEM COULD BE BETTER IT S DIFFICULT FOR THE PERSON I AM TALKING TO TO HEAR ME WHEN THE FAN IS RUNNING IN THE VEHICLE IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE MIC WAS DIRECTLY ABOVE THE DRIVER OR ON THE STEERING WHEEL
VOICE CONTROL NEEDS TO BE VERY MUCH EASIER TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT I EXPECT IF I TOOK THE TIME ONE DAY AND SAT DOWN AND PLAYED WITH IT ALL FOR COUPLE OF HOURS I WOULD BE OK WITH IT BUT IT JUST NEEDS TO WORK INTUITIVELY FOR EXAMPLE HONDA P
WISH IT HAD MULTI CD SYSTEM
THE IDENTIFICATION SYMBOLS FOR THE STEERING COLUMN CONTROLS FOR HANDS FREE PHONE USE ARE NOT EASY TO SEE ESPECIALLY IF YOU NEED READING GLASSES AND ARE NOT EASY TO INTERPRET MEANING WHAT EACH BUTTON DOES IS NOT INTUITIVE I GET CONFUSED AS TO
CHANGING DEVICES ON TOUCH SCREEN UOLD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
IS IT POSSIBLE TO COMBINE TWO SCREEN INTO ONE I DON T IT IS NECESSARY TO PLACE TWO SCREENS THERE
HOW CAN YOU STILL HAVE SINGLE CD PLAYER
SOME FEATURES ONLY WORK WORK WITH IPHONES NEED TO MAKE AVAILABLE FOR ANDROID DEVICES ALSO
I HAVE ONLY USED THE CD PLAYER AND PHONE ON A REGULAR BASIS
SOMETIMES TOO COMPLICATED TO CHANGE RADIO CHANNELS TOO MANY CLICKS OLD NON DIGITAL WAY WAS EASIER AND I FEEL I CAN GET DISTRACTED DRIVING TRYING TO FLIP THROUGH MY PRESETS WHICH IS BAD> NEED TO KEEP IT SIMPLE FOR SAFE DRIVING
THE CONTROLS ARE VERY SMALL HOWEVER I DON T KNOW HOW THEY COULD BE IMPROVED DUE TO SPACE IN THE VEHICLE I LIKE HE LARGE DISPLAY FOR THE NAVI SYSTEM
I WOULD PREFER A MULTI DISC CD PLAYER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CANNOT BE OPERATED MANUALLY IF THE VEHICLE IS IN OPERATION EVEN BY THE PASSENGER IT TAKES A LOT MORE TIME TO DO PROGRAM IT ORALLY
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CHALLENGING IVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION FEATURE FOR THE COST I SHOULDN T HAVE TO DOWNLOAD AN APP AND USE IT WHILE DRIVING TO CHECK TRAFFIC
APPS THAT WORK WITH IPHONE
I HAVE DIFFICULTY PROGRAMMING THE NAVIGATION AND HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED TRYING TO PUT IN AN ADDRESS I WILL HAVE TO GO TO THE DEALERSHIP TO HAVE THEM GIVE ME A TUTORIAL IT WAS WORKING WHEN I LEFT THE DEALERSHIP AND WAS VERY HAPPY THE FIRST FEW WE
EASIER TO USE ON SCREEN CONTROLS
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN ATTEMPTING TO MAKE A PHONE CALL
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY ISSUES COULD BE IMPROVED
I VE HAD TO PAIR MY IPHONE WITH THE BLUETOOTH SEVERAL TIMES
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THROUGH THE APP TRAINING ON USE OF THE SYSTEM
I WISH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD NOT DIRECT ME TO SITES I SELECT E G RESTAURANT THAT I ALREADY PASSED MORE THAN ONCE I VE PULLED OFF AN INTERSTATE THINKING SOMETHING WAS NEARBY ONLY TO FIND IT WAS AT THE PREVIOUS EXIT
THE VOICE PROMPTS TAKE TOO LONG DIFFICULT TO USE
NOTHING REALLY SINCE I DON T USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OR MUCH OF ANYTHING ELSE
MAKE IT EASIER TO REACH THE PORTS IN THE CENTER COUNSEL BUTTONS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN ARE A BIT SMALL AND HARD TO PRESS WHEN DRIVING ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE BIG FINGERS THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS MAKE UP FOR MOST OF THAT THEY ARE VERY GOOD
AS I AM AN ANDROID USER I WOULD REALLY LIKE ANDROID INTEGRATION AT THIS MOMENT THE HONDALINK APP ONLY WORKS WITH THE IPHONE
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T WORK WITH MY PHONE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO USE IT
THE BLUETOOTH SEEMS TO PICK UP A LOT OF NOISE FROM THE VEHICLE WHEN DRIVING OVER 30 MPH SPEED LIMIT
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER MY IPOD IPHONE FROM THE TOUCH SCREEN I AM ABLE TO SKIP THROUGH SONGS EASILY AND PUT SOUND ON PAUSE BUT I CAN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESTART FROM THE TOUCH SCREEN WHEN SOMETHING IS PAUSED
SORRY BUT I HAVE MORE THAN ONE 1ST STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS WITHOUT A PAUSE OR OFF BUTTON IN WOW I EXPECTED A LOT BETTER FROM A HONDA MY 2004 ELEMENT HAD A BASIC STEREO THAT WAS EASIER BETTER TO USE 2ND THE TOUCHSCREEN IS A PAIN
NEED AXU IMPURT ON ALL RADIOS THAT DONT HAVE XM BUILT IN
I HAVE HAD THE VOICE COMMAND ACTIVATION OF MY PHONE MAKE A COUPLE OF ERRORS STRANGELY IT WOULD SELECT SOMEONE TO CALL THAT I HAVEN T EVEN TRAINED INSTEAD OF THE PERSON THAT I TRAINED FOR THAT COMMAND WHEN I CANCELED THE CALL AND TRIED AGAIN
AM AND FM STATION SELECTIONS MYSTERIOUS AND EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO MAKE NO CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN EITHER
AUDIO SYSTEM SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER VOLUME IS GOOD BUT BASS LACKS DEFINITION AND IMPACT MID RANGE IS A BIT MUDDY AND TREBLE IS A BIT TINNY
NOT ENOUGH TRAINING ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND TOO DIFFICULT TO USE
HARD TO USE TOUCH BUTTONS ON AUDIO SYSTEM
MAKE IT EASIER TO PAIR IPOD TO SYSTEM
THE VOICE COMMANDS DON T WORK TO CONTROL MUSIC ON A USB FLASH DRIVE THAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WORKS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS LIKE SO OLD TYPE LIKE MY GPS FROM 10 YEARS AGO
NAVIGATING PHONE MENUS IS ARTIFICIALLY BLOCKED WHEN VEHICLE IS IN MOTION WHEN OTHER PROFOUNDLY MORE CONFUSING MENUS SUCH AS XM RADIO MENU TREES ARE NOT BLOCKED THIS IS EXTREMELY ANNOYING
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONNECT ONE PHONE FOR CELL PHONE USE AND ANOTHER PHONE AT THE SAME TIME FOR LISTENING TO MUSIC
I WOULD RATHER HAVE KNOBS FOR VOLUME AND TUNING RATHER THAN TOUCH CONTROL
I WOULD LIKE FOR THE RADIO S RDS DISPLAY TO AUTOMATICALLY DISPLAY WHEN I M LISTENING TO THE RADIO IN ADDITION IT WOULD BE REALLY AWESOME TO HAVE THE SONG NAME AND ARTIST DISPLAY ON THE SCREEN WHEN I M LISTENING TO A CD OR MY PHONE THROUGH THE CD
THE DEALER TRIED TO CONNECT MY PHONE S PANDORA TO THE CAR AND FAILED I DON T KNOW IF IT S MY PHONE OR THE CAR AND NOW I CAN T EVEN FIND THE MENU FOR IT THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT VERY SENSITIVE WHICH MAKES IT HARD TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING
VERY IMPORTANT YOU NEED TO ALLOW THE PERSON IN THE RIGHT SEAT ACCESS TO NAVIGATION CONTROLS WHILE THE DRIVER IS OPERATING THE VEHICLE
I DON T HAVE A SMART PHONE SO THAT FUNCTION IS NOT UTILIZED GRANDCHILDREN USE THE OTHER ELECTRONIC FUNCTIONS
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AN EXTERNAL VOLUME BUTTON NOT JUST ON THE TOUCH SCREEN BUT A REAL BUTTON THAT S NOT JUST ON THE STEERING WHEEL
WOULD BE GREAT IF IT HAD FULL FUNCTIONALITY WITH ANDROID PRODUCTS NOT JUST APPLE
NEED APP FOR ANDROID PHONE
THE SUDIO QUALITY WHEN I USE THE BLUETOOTH IS VERY POOR ALDO THE MICROPHOEN ONLY PICKS UP THE DRIVER S VOICE IF A PASSENGER IS SPEAKING THEIR VOICE IS HARDLY PICKED UP
THE SOUND SYSTEM IS NOT VERY GOOD THE HEADPHONES ARE BETTER BUT THEY HAVE STATIC FREQUENTLY
THE SYSTEM WILL BLUETOOTH PHONE BUT NOT AUDIO IN A AGAIN MY MISTAKE FOR PURCHASING SAME I DIDN T THINK IT WOULD BOTHER ME THAT MUCH BUT MY OTHER VEHICLE HAS ALL OF THESE KIND OF FEATURES AND YES IT DOES HAVE SAT BUT AGAIN THE HONDA IS A

I D LIKE TO HAVE VOICE CONTROL FOR MUSIC PLAYED VIA BLUETOOTH OR USB
I WOULD LIKE THE CAR TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO READ TEXT MESSAGES
THE VOICE RECOGNITION FUNCTION RARELY WORKS FOR ME IT S QUITE FRUSTRATING
STEERING COLUMN CONTROLS FOR HANDS FREE PHONE ARE NOT READILY UNDERSTANDABLE I M STILL FIGURING OUT HOW TO USE THEM
THE HONDALINK APPS ARE WEAK AND IT TAKES THREE EXTRA CABLES TO CONNECT MY IPHONE TO THE CAR AND THE MAP APP COSTS $60 AND HAS TERRIBLE RATINGS ONLINE I WISH THE SYSTEM USED APPLE S CARPLAY SYSTEM INSTEAD SO IT INTEGRATED MORE SEAMLESSLY WITH MY

NO MAP OF MY AREA
GET RID OF THE SATELLITE RADIO TRIAL PERIOD IT IS A RIP OFF TRAP AND THEY BADGER YOU HALF TO DEATH TO JOIN I RESENT THAT
NO NAVAGATION
MAKE BLUETOOTH STANDARD
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE HAND S FREE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM WOULD RELAY COMMANDS TO MY IPOD I E SIRI WHILE IN BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO PUSH THE BUTTON ON THE IPHONE ITSELF TO ACTIVATE SIRI
CHANGING STATIONS ON RADIO COULD HAVE SYSTEM LIKE TOYOTA PRIUS
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A SEEK FEATURE ON THE STEERING WHEEL INSTEAD OF IT JUST GOING UP AND DOWN THROUGH YOUR PRESETS
EASE OF USING VOICE COMMANDS TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE VARIOUS AUTOMOBILE FUNCTIONS
ALL NEW VEHICLES SHOULD COME WITH BLUETOOTH AND EASE OF USE BUT I HAD TO GET AFTERMARKET BLUETOOTH EVEN AFTER BUYING A CAR FOR 28K WTF
KEYBOARD COULD BE QWERTY VOICE WOULD NOT SAY NEXT RIGHT UNLESS IT S THE IMMEDIATE NEXT RIGHT
I FIND IT FRUSTRATING THAT THE IPOD MENU RESETS EVERY TIME THE CAR IS SHUT DOWN OR A PHONE CALL IS MADE
I FIND IT AWKWARD TO CHANGE STATIONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL WE HAVE AN OLDER PILOT AND THE STATION CHANGE BUTTON IS ON THE OUTER EDGE OF THE STEERING CONSOLE AND I FIND THAT ONE EASIER TO ADJUST
HAVE ABILITY FOR MAP SYSTEM TO DEFAULT TO YOUR STATE WHEN ENTERING ADDRESSES OR LOOKING FOR POINTS OF INTEREST
NEEDED GPS NO REASON NOT TO HAVE WITH A TOUCH SCREEN IN THE CAR
WOULD LIKE THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES THROUGH THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM AND THE ABILITY TO CREATE TEXT MESSAGES THROUGH THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM VERY DISAPPOINTED THIS FEATURE IS NOT AVAILABLE
NAVIGATION SOMETIMES CONFUSING
THE HANDSFREE TO PRIVATE CALL SEEMS TO SWITCH BACK AND FORTH WITHOUT APPARENT REASON THE DEFAULT SHOULD BE THE BLUETOOTH TO THE CAR I HAVE TO TOGGLE THE SPEAKER ON MY IPHONE TO GET IT TO SWITCH FROM HANDSET TO CAR
SHOULD BE EASIER TO SET UP DESTINATION USING VOICE COMMANDS
VERBAL COMMANDS FOR NAVIGATION
BETTER SOUND QUALITY FOR LOWER BASS LEVELS
POI SYSTEM COULD USE A LITTLE IMPROVEMENT
VOICE RECOGNITION IS USELESS I WILL TRY TO PLAY WITH IT SOME MORE AND THEN BRING BACK TO DEALER FOR HELP
THE IPOD CONNECTIVITY IS USELESS CAUSING ME TO HAVE TO USE XM RADIO THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL IT HAS PROBLEMS WITH EVERY PORTION OF ITS CONTROL LACK OF MULTIPLE CD S IS AN ISSUE AND THE USB FUNCTIONALITY IS LIMITED WHY TH

TIRED OF HAVING TO ACCEPT NAV SYSTEM TERMS EVERY SINGLE TIME I START THE CAR
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN MAKING CALLS
THE BLUELINK NAVIGATION TAKES THIS RATING MUCH LOWER THAN IT SHOULD DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FUNCTION OF IT AND THE PRICE DON T THEY KNOW CELL PHONES HAVE APPS THAT ARE BETTER THAN THEIR SYSTEM
RELIABILITY OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM MERCEDES HAS A SYSTEM THAT LEARNS VOICES AND ACCENTS THIS SEEMS TO BE A PROBLEM FOR MY CAR
IMPROVE THE DOWNLOAD SPEED FROM DEVICES LIKE AN IPOD AND MOBILE PHONE INTO THE SYSTEM
I TWICE INADVERTENTLY CALLED FOR EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE WHILE ADJUSTING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I M CAREFUL TO AVOID THE BUTTONS NOW
VOICE RECOGNITION IS STILL A CHALLENGE FOR MOST IN CAR SYSTEMS AND ROAD NOISE MAKES IT WORSE BETTER ALGORITHMS WILL COME ALONG AND HOPEFULLY OUR SYSTEM S FIRMWARE CAN BE UPDATED
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESNT UNDERSTAND COMMANDS
USB PORT MOT CONNECTING PHONE OR MP3 TO AUDIO SYSTEM
WOULD LIKE BOSE SPEAKERS TO BE STANDARD
VOICE RECOGNITION LET DRIVER PROGRAM PRONUNCIATION OF NAMES INTO MEMORY SO IT DOES NOT BRING UP MULTIPLE CONTACTS AND YOU STILL HAVE TO TAKE EYES OFF THE ROAD TO SELECT THE DESIRED CONTACT
SOUND QUALITY HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO ADJUST IT TO MY LIKING
THE SPEAKERS THEY SUCK AND TO GET THE BETTER SPEAKERS FROM HYUNDAI YOU HAVE TO BUY THE BETTER PACKAGES THE CHEAPEST ON IS $4500 WHICH INCLUDES STUFF WE DID NOT WANT IN THE VEHICLE EXAMPLE LEATHER SEATS NAVIGATION ETC
NAV SYSTEM SLOW WE RE STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE
STORING AND RECALLING PERSONAL POI IS DIFFICULT AND AWKWARD AS MENTIONED EARLIER HAVING TO PAY FOR MAP AND TRAFFIC UPGRADES IS EXPENSIVE I CAN USE MY GARMIN WITH LIFETIME UPDATES FOR FREE THE GARMIN COST ME $120 THE CAR COST ME $38 000 SAME W
I ALREADY COMMENTED ON THE DIFFICULTY I EXPERIENCED WITH BLUE LINK I WILL REQUEST ASSISTANCE WHEN MY FIRST SERVICE APPOINTMENT
THE SOUND IS JUST NORMAL I WOULD LIKE THE ABILITY TO EASILY ADJUST THE SOUND QUALITY IE MORE BASE OR TREBLE RATHER ALWAYS AT MID RANGE
THE EQUALIZER ON THE RADIO NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED THE BASS TREBLE THERE IS NONE THE DISPLAY ON THE RADIO DOES NOT DISPLAY THE ARTIST AND SONG ON AM FM STATIONS
INTEGRATE TRAFFIC INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IS VASTLY INFERIOR TO GOOGLE MAPS ON A SMART PHONE IN ESTIMATING TRAFFIC AND PREDICTING DESTINATION TIME

IMPROVE CONSISTENCY OF SOUND QUALITY SOMETIMES SOUND LOUDNESS QUALITY VARIES FROM RADIO TO BLUETOOTH TO CD TO PHONE

I WISH THE DISPLAY SCREEN WERE LARGER FOR THE RADIO CONTROLS
SHORTEN VOICE COMMAND MESSAGES OR HAVE AN OPTION TO SHORTEN
SIZE OF TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY COULD BE LARGER
LARGER TOUCH SCREEN
THE FACTORY SPEAKERS ARE VERY LOW AND SOUND CHEAP IN ADDITION THERE ARE VERY FEW CONTROLS AVAILABLE TO ADJUST THE SOUND EQUALIZER NON EXISTENT
TOO COMPLICATED FOR US COULDN T WORK SATELLITE RADIO SO CANCELLED IT MANY FEATURES EG BLUELINK ONLY COMPATIBLE WITH TABLETS SMARTPHONES WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE SO FEATURES ARE OF NO USE OR VALUE TO US
ONE THING THAT WOULD BE NICE IF I COULD HAVE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION FOR MY GPS ON MY PHONE BUT STILL LISTEN TO THE RADIO IF YOU HAVE RADIO ON BUT WANT THE GPS TO COME THROUGH THE CAR IT WON T WORK I HAVE TO HAVE THE BLUETOOTH ON FOR MY GPS A
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER DOESNT ALWAYS CALL THE CORRECT PERSON

THE AUDIO AT BLUETOOTH CONNECT IS LOW AND MUFFLED
SPEAKERS VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE
VOICE ACTIVATED CALLING FROM CONTACT LIST ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHONE
I ONLY USE MY PHONE CONNECTED THRU BLUETOOTH IT SEEMS AS IF THERE IS MANY GLITCHES WHEN THE PHONE IS CONNECTED THRU THE USB PORT
TOUCH SCREEN TO ANSWER INCOMING CALL OFTEN DOESN T WORK MUST CONTINUALLY TOUCH THE ANSWER BUTTON ON THE TOUCH SCREEN SHOULD ANSWER ON FIRST TOUCH
THE ROUTING OF DIRECTIONS THE DETOURS AROUND TRAFFIC ARE COMPLETELY USELESS IT TELLS YOU TO TAKE EACH EXIT AND THEN GET BACK ON THE HIGHWAY YOU END UP SITTING IN MORE TRAFFIC BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC ON RAMPS AND MERGING TRAFFIC
MORE ACCURATE VOICE RECOGNITION
DIFFICULT TO CONNECT TO BLUELINK NAVIGATION
I HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM

SOMETIMES PEOPLE CAN T HEAR ME VERY WELL ON THE BLUETOOTH
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT AS USER FRIENDLY AS IT COULD BE INTEGRATING WITH A THIRD PARTY GOOGLE MAPS TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY WOULD HELP TREMENDOUSLY
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION AND BETTER REPEAT CONNECTIVITY TO THE INTERNET APPS SUCH AS PANDORA
SOMETIMES VOICE COMMANDS DO NOT WORK WHEN MAKING CALLS AND SETTING UP NAVIGATION OFTEN THE COMMANDS HAVE TO BE REPEATED CURRENTLY I AM NOT FINDING THE AP SUITE VERY USEFUL AT THIS POINT AND OFTERN THERE ARE ISSUES WITH USING THE AP SUITE I FIN
SOUND QUALITY AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CAN T GET THE LOCATIONS CORRECT THROUGH THE VOICE RECOGNITION
NEED SIMPLER VOICE RECOGNITION COMMANDS NOM MULTIPLE LAYERS ONE COMMAND GETS YOU WHAT YOU WANT
BETTER INTEGRATION OF SIRI IS A MUST
VERY LIMITED APPS NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY
CANT HEAR VERY WELL WITH PHONE CONNECTION TO SPEAKER IN CAR
ANDROID PHONE APPLICATION COULD BE IMPROVED NO WINDOWS PHONE VERSION OF SOFTWARE
I FIND THE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES VIA BLUETOOTH WITH THE LEXUS ENFORM APP SUITE TO BE THE ONLY REALLY ANNOYING ISSUES MOST EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS REALLY WELL I LOVE DESTINATION ASSIST
EASE OF ABORTING DESTINATION ON NAV SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO VERBALLY ENTER AN ADDRESS AND HAVE IT UNDERSTOOD THE FIRST TIME USUALLY TAKES 2 3 TIMES TO GET THE CORRECT ADDRESS ENTERED VERBALLY
THE REAR SEAT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS UNACCEPTABLY DIFFICULT TO USE
I FEEL THAT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOICE RECOGNITION AND CELL PHONE CONNECTIVITY AREN T STATE OF THE ART I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT APPLE S CAR PLAY WASN T AVAILABLE
THE BIGGEST ISSUE I HAVE IS THAT THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOICE COMMANDS RARELY WORK IF EVER THAT NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
IT WOULD BE CONVENIENT TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A TEXT MESSAGE USING VOICE COMMAND
THE SPEAKERS DON T SOUND AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED THE NAVIGATION IS SLOW WHEN TYPING
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM USUALLY DOESN T UNDERSTAND THE COMMAND I USUALLY HAVE TO REPEAT MY COMMAND AT LEAST TWICE EACH TIME
ONLY ISSUE IS VOICE COMMANDS HAVE TO FACE MICROPHONE AND SHOUT
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR ADDRESSES AND LOOKING AT THE ROUTE AHEAD FOR A DESTINATION
I DISLIKE THAT THE SCREEN EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE 12 9 SCREEN ALWAYS CUTS OFF THE SONG TITLES I WISH IT WOULD DISPLAY THE WHOLE TITLE WITHIN REASON ALSO I WISH THAT WHEN MY IPOD IS SYNCED THROUGH BLUETOOTH THAT I STILL HAD ACCESS TO LOOK FO
SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER IPHONE LOOSES BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WHEN PLUGGED INTO USB PORT IT EFFECTS IF YOU ARE TRYING TO CHARGE YOUR PHONE WHILE GETTING NAVIGATION TALKING DIRECTIONS FROM YOUR DEVICE
MORE INTUITIVE CONTROLS LESSEN AMOUNT OF PATHS NEEDED TO CHOSE A SELECTION TAKE A LESSON FROM THE NEW BMW INFOTAINMENT SYSTEMS
BEING ABLE TO RECHARGE MY IPHONE OR IPAD WHEN THE VEHICLE IS OFF
NAVIGATION SYSTEM JUST NOT GOOD YESTERDAY I TRIED TO USE IT AND JUST GAVE UP AND USED MY PHONE
VOICE COMMAND IS TERRIBLE
AUDIO   RADIO CHANNEL CONTROL IS TERRIBLE PREFER TO HAVE THIS BE EASILY SET VIA THE KNOB CONTROL VS THE MOUSE BASED CONTROL VERY DIFFICULT TO GET TO THE DESIRED CHANNEL AND PLEASE ONCE THE SATELLITE XM SERVICE IS DISABLED I DON T WANT I
THE MOUSE IS HARD TO USE TO NAVIGATE AROUND THE SCREEN AND THE VOICE QUALITY O THE PHONE IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY WAS
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM IN THE CAR COULD BE BETTER
THE SPEAKERS SOUND CHEAP POOR AUDIO QUALITY ON FM AND SATELLITE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY POOR IN MANY ASPECTS ESPECIALLY ON INPUTTING DATA AND ON THE DISPLAY SCREEN IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO SEE THE DISPLAYED DATA I REFUSED TO PAY FOR SUCH A POOR NAV SYSTEM IN ORDER TO MAKE THE SALE THE DEALER DID NOT CH
THE ABSENCE OF A TOUCH SCREEN AND THAT MOUSE TO CONTROL EVERYTHING IS AWFUL IT S A 10 STEP PROCESS TO CHANGE A RADIO STATION AND I DON T LIKE THE WAY ALL THE CHANNELS JUST FLOW TOGETHER AM FM SATELITE EVERYTHING IS TOGETHER JUST NOT DES
NAVIGATION IS VERY POOR IT CAN NOT LOCATE ADDRESSES IT ARRIVES BEFORE I ACTUALLY KNOW THE LOCATION NOT THAT EASY TO USE I NEED TO STILL USE CELL PHONE NAVIGATION TO MAKE SURE I GET TO THE PLACE CORRECTLY CELL PHONE NAVIGATION IS MUCH BETTER
MORE CRISP FAST HITTING BASE LESS LINGERING BASE ECHOING WON T PLAY SONGS OR MOVIES LOADED ON A 1 TB EXTERNAL PORTABLE DRIVE THROUGH USB
I THINK IT MIGHT BE DRIVING NOISE BUT MANY PEOPLE CAN T HEAR ME CLEARLY IF I AM SPEAKING THROUGH HANDS FREE
I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IPOD CONNECTIVITY
NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN COULD BE BIGGER LIKE THE ONE IN MY GS350
A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD MAKE USING IT ALOT EASIER
EASIER ACCESSIBILITY TO ALL FEATURES DO NOT USE THE TOUCH PAD VERY OFTEN
IT S MUCH TOO COMPLICATED TO USE WITHOUT TAKING ATTENTION FROM DRIVING THE TOUCH PAD IS A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR A KNOB OR DIAL
PROBLEM WITH VOICE RECOGNITION
ABILITY TO NAVIGATE SYSTEM
TOUCH SCREEN IS SLOW TO CATCH UP WITH TOUCH
NAVIGATION REQUIRES AN ADDRESS RATHER THAN JUST SAYING I WANT TO GO TO STARBUCKS OR TAKE ME TO THE NEAREST STARBUCKS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD SHOW SPEED LIMITS ON ROAD AS WELL AS DIGITAL SPEED OF VEHICLE PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENTER DESTINATION WHILE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION THE AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAUSE LIVE RADIO AND SHOULD DISPLAY C
I FIND THE NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO USE
BLUETOOTH HANDS FREE PHONE HAS SOME HIGH FREQUENCY FEEDBACK ON OCCASION
LESS TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS
WHEN USING HD SAT OR USB THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS AMAZING DEEP BASES WITHOUT UNSEEN RATTLING THE PROBLEM IS THAT ALL OF THE APPS ONE COULD USE WITH THE CAR COST ABOUT $130 A YEAR AND THERE IS A CHARGE FOR EACH APP I PAID OVER $60K OUT THE DOOR FOR
THE VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM IS VERY AMATEURISH
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE WIFI LIKE BUICK ENCLAVE FOR TRAVELING LONG DISTANCES
USE OF HD RADIO FOR TRAFFIC AND WEATHER ONLY WORKS IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS HD RADIO I LIVE IN WILMINGTON NC NO HD RADIO THAT HAS TRAFFIC AND WEATHER
LOVE ALL THE FEATURES BUT ONLY HAD TO USE NAVIGATION FEATURE ONCE SINCE OWNED
MY FACEBOOK PANDORA ETC CAN T BE CONNECTED
THE BLUETOOTH IS AMAZING
I KNOW THE TOUCH SYSTEM IS SUPPOSE TO MAKE THINGS EASIER BUT I FIND I HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND MANY TIMES I HIT THE WRONG THING AND IT GOES INTO THE SETTINGS MODE
TOUCHSCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND SEE WHILE DRIVING NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED
I FEEL THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS TOO CUMBERSOME THERE ARE TOO MANY STEPS AND OFTEN I WILL JUST GIVE UP AND USE MY SMARTPHONE IN MY SMARTPHONE I CAN JUST SAY STARBUCKS AND IT WILL SHOW ME OPTIONS
THE SPEAKERS ONLY SOUND CLEAN AND NICE AT HIGH VOLUMES I DON T WANT TO BLARE MY MUSIC TO ENJOY IT I LOVE AMBIENT MUSIC ALL THE TIME IT S NOT SPECIAL AT ALL IN THE CAR NO ONE EVER COMMENTS ON IT AND THEY SHOULD BECAUSE IT S NEW TECHNOLOGY A
THERE ARE TWO BIG MISSES 1 ENTERING A NAVIGATION DESTINATION BY VOICE SHOULD ALLOW YOU TO JUST SAY THE ADDRESS WITH NUMBER STREET CITY AND STATE IN NATURAL SPEAK WITHOUT HAVING TO LEARN A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT COMMANDS OR USE MULTIPLE STEPS
VOICE RECOGNITION RARELY GETS THE INTENDED VOICE COMMAND CORRECT THE NAVIGATION IS AWFUL
IT SEEMS LIKE MY VOICE COMMANDS ARE NEVER UNDERSTOOD BY THE SYSTEM IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE GIVEN ALTERNATE ROUTES TO A DESTINATION
I CANNOT USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY IPHONE
SOUND QUALITY IS POOR AND THERE IS NO REAL ADJUSTMENT THE DEMO IS THE ONLY GOOD SOUND QUALITY
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION REALLY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT WHEN I GIVE IT A STREET CITY ADDRESS IT NORMALLY TAKES 3 4 ATTEMPTS TO GET IT CORRECT
WHEN ON A PHONE CALL VOLUME NEEDS TO BE VERY HIGH WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS AN AUTO VOICE BOOST WHEN SWITCHING FROM ENTERTAINMENT TO PHONE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE EASIER TO USE IN SETTING NEW DESTINATION FROM AN ENTERED ADDRESS I VE BEEN IN OTHER VEHICLES THIS IS MUCH EASIER TO DO AND FIND
MY RC IS THE THIRD LEXUS THAT CAME WITH MOUSE AND IT S NOT EASY TO USE TOUCH SCREEN WAS A LOT BETTER I WAS HOPING LEXUS HAVE IMPROVED THE MOUSE BUT HASN T QUITE YET MOUSE PAD IS A LITTLE BETTER TO USE THAN STICK IN MY RX BUT STILL NEE
TOUCH PAD OPERATION IS OVERSENSITIVE AND VERY DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING HARD TO GET THE CORRECT SETTING ON THE SCREEN WHEN USING TOUCH PAD NEED TO TAKE EYES OFF THE ROAD WHEN USING
I DON T LIKE THE WAY THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS BIASED SUCH THAT THE SOUND SEEMS TO COME FROM THE DASHBOARD AND NOT A SURROUND EXPERIENCE THE FIDELITY AND FREQUENCY SPECTRUM IS EXCELLENT BUT HONESTLY I LIKE THE SOUND FROM THE AUDIO SYSTEM IN MY 2001
BIGGEST PROBLEM IS GETTING THE NAVIGATION TO TAKE VOICE COMMANDS IT OFTEN MISUNDERSTANDS REQUESTS AND DICTATION OF ADDRESSES PROBABLY THE ONLY THINK I DON T LOVE ABOUT THE CAR WELL THE SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER
TOUCH PAD
NAVIGATION SCREEN HAS SO MANY FINGER PRINTS ON IT AND WHEN THE SUN STRIKE THE SCREEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THE SCREEN UNLESS I SHADE IT
EASIER VOICE RECOGNITION
I DO NOT USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT NEVER KNOWS WHERE THE CAR IS MY PHONE IS MORE RELIABLE IT DOES NOT WORK AND GIVES VERY MISLEADING DIRECTIONS
VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY EASY TO UTILIZE FOR AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION TOUCH SCREEN IS ALSO INTUITIVE AND EASY TO USE
I HAVEN T TAKEN THE TIME TO REALLY PRACTICE WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS FOR RADIO NEED TO BE ON LEFT SIDE INSTEAD OF RIGHT SIDE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOTHING LIKE MY IPHONE SO I HAVE NOT YET SUCCESSFULLY USED IT I MUST MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE THE DEALER FOR MORE INSTRUCTION AS IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE MY COMMANDS SO THAT HAS BEEN REALLY FRUSTRATING IT S LIKE THE VOI
COMMAND CENTER COMMUNICATIONS UNDERSTANDING VOICE COMMANDS
THE SATELLITE RADIO CUTS OUT MULTIPLE TIMES DAILY EVEN WHEN IN OPEN AIR THE DEALERSHIP SAID THEY WERE WORKING ON A SOLUTION BUT HAVE NOT CONTACTED ME TO REPLACE THE ANTENNA
JUST USE GOOGLE FOR NAVIGATION IMPROVE SPEAKERS FOR THE RADIO
IMPROVED SPEAKERS SOUND QUALITY IS NOTHING SPECIAL AND SHOULD BE
THE BUTTONS FOR RADIO PRESETS COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER SOMETIMES I HAVE TO TOUCH IT MORE THAN ONCE
QUALITY OF SIRIUS RADIO SOUND IS POOR PLAYBACK OF MUSIC FROM USB HAS POOR INTERFACE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOMETIMES GETS THE NAME COMMAND WRONG AND EVERY TIME YOU GO IN AND OUT OF THE VEHICLE YOU HAVE TO RECONNECT THE BLUETOOTH IF THE VEHICLES WAS KEPT RUNNING THIS DELAYS COMMUNICATION TIME SPEAKERS SOMETIMES ARE TOO LOUD QU
DIFFICULT TO CHANGE STATIONS BY HAND ESPECIALLY IF DRIVING STILL HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO SET FAV STATIONS CLOCK SHOULD BE LOCATED ON DISPLAY NOT WHERE CURRENTLY LOCATED IN FACT WORST LOCATION POSSIBLE
THE LEGAL DISCLAIMER COMES UP EVERY TIME I TURN ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ANNOYING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UPDATED UPGRADED
VOICE RECOGNITION MORE PRESETS ON SATELLITE RADIO 6 IS NOT ENOUGH TO SAVE MY FAVORITE CHANNELS
ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE TEXT MESSAGES ON AN IPHONE
EVEN WITH THE BOSE SPEAKER SYSTEM THE SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO BE THE BEST QUALITY AND IT SEEMS IT HAS TO BE TURNED UP PRETTY HIGH TO GET IT LOUD FOR THE KIDS IN THE BACK TO HEAR WELL
IF THE NAVIGATION WORKED PROPERLY AND VOICE COMMAND RECOGNITION WAS BETTER AND IF THE USB PORT WAS HIGHER TECH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 10S ACROSS THE BOARD WHEN MY NAV WORKS PROPERLY IT IS AWESOME BUT IT ONLY WORKS 30% OF THE TIME AND THAT IS RIDI
THE NAVIGATION AND THE DISPLAY CAN USE HIGHER RESOLUTION MORE APPEALING GRAPHICS
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT MY IPAD
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR HANDS FREE PHONE CALLING
THE NAVIGATION IS NOT THE EASIEST TO USE IT IS SLOW TO RESPOND TO VERBAL COMMANDS AND OFTEN MISUNDERSTANDS RESPONDING WITH A TOTALLY DIFFERENT RESPONSE PERHAPS A DIFFERENT NAVIGATION SYSTEM LIKE A GARMIN WOULD IMPROVE THINGS
SOUND VARIES FROM INPUT TO INPUT IE RADIO SOUND IS LOWER THAN SIRUS AND THEN LOWER THAN PHONE CALLS I HAVE TO ADJUST THE VOLUME EVERY TIME I CHANGE THE INPUT
IMPROVED CONNECTIVITY WITH PHONE FOR PANDORA USAGE
THE NAVIGATION IS DELAYED AND APPEARS VERY 2 DIMENSIONAL THE ENTIRE INTERFACE SEEMS VERY BEHIND ON TECHNOLOGY ESPECIALLY SINCE IT CAN T EVEN GET SATELLITE RADIO UNLESS I TAKE IT IN TO PAY MORE TO ADD IT ON PAYING EXTRA TO HAVE NAVIGATION AND BO
I WAS INFORMED AT PURCHASE THAT MY VEHICLE CONTAINED NAVIGATION ONLY REALIZING AFTER PURCHASE THAT IT DID NOT
IPOD INTERFACE IS ANNOYING BECAUSE IT RESETS THE IPOD AT EVERY START UP IDEALLY IT SHOULD GO BACK TO THE SONGS THAT WERE PLAYING THE LAST TIME DRIVEN
NO TEXT MESSAGE CAPABILITY THIS HAS PROVEN TO BE DANGEROUS WILL NEVER COMPROMISE SAFETY FOR CONVENIENCE
VERY BAD DESIGN BLUETOOTH IS VERY BUGGY
NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION HAS DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING STREET ADDRESSES
IT COULD COME STANDARD WITH BLUETOOTH BUT MINE DOES NOT HAVE BLUETOOTH
ILLINOIS REQUIRES HANDS FREE PHONE USAGE
THE NAV SYSTEM SHOULD OFFER SOME SHORT CUTS WHEN ASKING FOR INFO ABOUT GIVING A DIRECTION
IT TAKES FOREVER FOR THE VEHICLE TO CONNECT TO MY PHONE THE CAN T PLAY AUDIO WHILE DOWNLOADING PHONE CONTENT MESSAGE STAYS UP FOR SEVERAL MINUTES IN ADDITION WHILE THE VEHICLE SUPPOSEDLY CAN DOWNLOAD TEXT MESSAGES IT S NEVER BEEN ABLE TO D
THE VEHICLE HAS A VERY HARD TIME RECOGNIZING WHAT I VE SAID WHEN I TRY TO MAKE CALLS WITH MY SMARTPHONE WHEN I TRY TO MAKE CALLS IT CONTINUES TO TELL ME HOW TO OPERATE IT I DON T THINK IT S USER FRIENDLY AT ALL I REALLY WISH YOU COULD CHANGE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND ALLOW FOR EASIER ENTRY OF LOCATIONS
VOICE RECOGNITION SO I COULD USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND VOICE TO CALL
BETTER LOCATION OF THE IN CONTROL APPS FOR CONNECTING USB
THE VOICE SPEAKS INCREDIBLY SLOW AND I HAVE TO WAIT FOR A LONG SPACE AND TONE BEFORE I CAN ANSWER I M CAUCASIAN WITH NO SPECIFIC ACCENT YET IT HAS A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHAT I SAY SHE S NO SIRI IT S EXTREMELY ANNOYING SO I DON T USE IT
WOULD HAVE LIKED A CD PLAYER

CONNECT BLUETOOTH AUDIO FROM MY SMART PHONE GOOGLE MAPS TO THE AUDIO AND SCREEN GPS
VOICE RECOGNITION MAP NAV INTUITIVENESS AUDIO CONNECTIVITY
BETTER THAN MOST KNOBS AND DIALS ARE BEST WHILE DRIVING THE NAV SYSTEM TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO I M TERRIBLE WITH SIRI AS WELL SO MAYBE NOT TOTALLY LR S FAULT HERE
COMMANDS TO LONG AND UNABLE TO SHORT STEP VOICE COMMANDS A RETURN TO PRIOR MENU I E INFINITI BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD BE NICE
THE NAV IS TERRIBLE IT IS A JOKE THE SCREEN IS COVERED WITH JUNK YOU CAN T SEE THE MAP THE DISTANCE INTERVAL CONTROLS ARE ABSURD
AFTER REVIEWING NAV SYSTEMS IN VEHICLES SUCH AS MERCEDES DODGE GM AND FORD THE NAV SYSTEM IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE
I THOUGHT I WAS BUYING APPLE S CARPLAY BUT INSTEAD GOT A CHEAP IMITATION LAND ROVER S INCONTROL APPS ARE NOT VERY GOOD OR USEFUL VOICE CONTROLS TAKE TOO MANY STEPS AND ARE NOT VERY USEFUL
THE RANGE ROVER IS WAY BEHIND THE TECH CURVE WITH ITS INTERFACE WITH MY IPHONE BMW MERCEDES AND ESPECIALLY AUDI DO IT MUCH BETTER THE ON SCREEN INTERFACES ARE TO CUMBERSOME AND DIFFICULT TO USE A CAR OF THIS PRICE AND CLASS SHOULD REALLY GET
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST I SPEAK CLEARLY BUT I ALSO HAVE A CHILD IN THE BACK SEAT USUALLY TALKING OR USING A DEVICE WHICH INTERFERES WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION
WISH THERE WAS A CD PLAYER IN MY KIA
IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION ACCURACY AND SPEED MAKE SYSTEM MORE INTUITIVE
I HATE HAVING SIRIUS WHEN I WILL NEVER USE IT
THE TOUCH FOR THE RADIO IS TOO SENSITIVE SOMETIMES I WILL TOUCH IT AND IT WILL SKIP TO ANOTHER SATELLITE AND IS DIFFICULT TO GET THE OTHER ONE BACK I HAVE HAD TO PULL OF THE ROAD TO ADJUST IT
SOUND QUALITY IS LESS THAN AVERAGE
EQUALIZER CONTROLS ONLY ACCESSIBLE THROUGH CERTAIN RADIO FUNCTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE BASE TREBLE FROM ANY AUDIO SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CLUNKY
THE VOICE CONTROLS AREN T GOOD ENOUGH AS AN IPHONE USER SIRI IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE SYSTEM USED IN MY CAR
ON THE NAV SYSTEM WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO DESTINATION IT JUST SHOWS STREET NAME VERSUS THE HOUSE OR BUILDING NUMBER SO INSTEAD OF 617 N 63RD THE ROUTING SHOW N 63RD AND OFTEN AT THAT POINT I M TRYING TO FIND THE EXACT LOCATION SO HAVING STREE
I DON T LIKE THE MOUSE CONTROL FOR NAVIGATION IT S VERY HARD TO ENTER ADDRESSES TOUCH SCREEN IS MUCH BETTER
THE COMMAND OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION ARE TOO LONG AND HAS POOR VOICE RECOGNITION
THE MERIDIAN SOUND SYSTEM IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL THE IN CONTROL APPS FOR MUSIC IPOD NEEDS IMPROVEMENT SEEMS LIKE A STEP BEHIND IN TECHNOLOGY COMPARED WITH EVEN MUCH CHEAPER CARS
DIFFICULTIES WITH CONNECTING TO APPLICATIONS VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE NAVIGATION COULD USE A LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC ON THE MAP IS USUALLY INACCURATE
GET RID OF THE JOYSTICK CONTROLLER TOUCH SCREEN MUCH EASIER AND MORE INTUITIVE TO USE
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET GOOGLE MAPS AND BE ABLE TO FULLY USE AN ANDROID PHONE WITH ALL ITS APPLICATIONS BASICALLY RIGHT NOW THE NAVIGATION IS NOT THAT USEFUL AND FOR ENTERTAINMENT IT IS REALLY GEARED TOWARD IPHONES IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAV
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND THE TRAFFIC INFO ARE FAR LESS USEFUL THAN RELYING ON MY SMARTPHONE APPS GOOGLE MAPS OR WAZE
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR CALLING CONTACTS NOT THAT GREAT
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN ZIP CODES TO LOCATE ADDRESSES
WHEN LISTENING TO SIRIUSXM THE DISPLAY SHOWS THE GENRE OR CATEGORY OF THE STATION YOU RE LISTENING TO THE NAME OF THE STATION AND THE ARTIST BUT NOT THE SONG TITLE YOU HAVE TO CLICK THE MORE INFO BUTTON TO SEE THE SONG TITLE IT S POOR DES

THE BEST THING YOU COULD DO WOULD BE TO 1 INCORPORATE THE APP WAZE AND 2 IMPROVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE WHY CAN T I SIMPLY SAY GO HOME AND IT KNOWS THAT I WANT TO GO HOME VERY FRUSTRATING
THE BACKUP CAMERA DOES NOT WORK UNLESS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TURN ON WHEN YOU TURN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON TO USE THE MAP OR BACKUP CAMERA THE MUSIC COMES ON

EASIER WAY TO GET TO MY TEXTS
NAVIGATION MAP DATA IS NOT GOOD AT ALL SYSTEM IS NOT EASY TO USE AND DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND VOICE INPUTS
THE VEHICLE S VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER
IT WOULD HELP IF VOICE RECOGNITION WORKED FOR ANY SECTION AND NOT JUST THE ITEM YOU HAVE HIGHLIHHTED
SPEAKER QUALITY SHOULD BE IMPROVED AND I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE ADDITIONAL BUILT IN SUBWOOFERS
VOICE CONTROLLED NAVIGATION IS SOMEWHAT CONFUSING TO USE AND GET USED TO
TOUCH SCREEN WOULD HELP
VOICE OF THE SYSTEM CAN BE MORE GENTLE SHOULD HAVE POINTED OUR NEXT TURN WHEN MAKING A TURN WHILE USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
AFTER USING A GARMIN FOR THE PAST 10 YEARS THE BUILT IN SYSTEM IS A BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT THE M B SYSTEM CANNOT DO MANY THINGS MY GARMIN COULD AND THERE IS NO WAY TO ALTER THE DISPLAY SOME OF IT IS JUST REALLY SIMPLE E G I WANT IT TO SHOW
WEATHER AND TRAFFIC FEATURES W O REQUIRING SATELITE RADIO
THE NAV SYSTEM IS VOICE ONLY WHEN IN MOTION TOO TIME CONSUMING THE PASSENGER SHOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO OPERATE THE SYSTEM MANUALLY
NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE
REAR CAMERA RESOLUTION IS REALLY BAD ESPECIALLY DURING NIGHT RAINY DAY
THE POINTS OF INTEREST FUNCTION ON NAVIGATION IS CUMBERSOME
I DIDN T PAY FOR THE EXTRA ENTERTAINMENT PACKAGE AS I SOLELY USE MY APPLE MOBILE DEVICES FOR MUSIC AND AUDIO BOOKS BUT NOW I WISH I HAD I M NOT SURE IF IT WOULD HAVE IMPROVED THE CONTROLS BUT IT MIGHT HAVE GIVEN ME MORE OPTIONS WHEN INTERFACING
SOUND QUALITY ON THE OTHER HAND ITS A CAR NOT A CONCERT HALL
VOICE COMMAND NAV SUCKS
VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION
HARD TO PROGRAM IN AN ADDRESS FOR NAVIGATION
EASIER NAVIGATION SYSTEM PROGRAMING
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IN NAVIGATION NEEDS TO BE MUCH BETTER IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND VERY WELL
TOUCH SCREEN EASIER TO USE VOICE COMMAND
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE OPTION TO DISPLAY TURN BY TURN INSTRUCTIONS
THE SOUND QUALITY OF PHONE CALLS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE PRICED SEPARATELY SO IT BECOMES AN AFFORDABLE OPTION IT IS ONLY AVAILABLE AS PART OF A $3 000 MULTI MEDIA PACKAGE
NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN USING VERBAL COMMANDS WHILE DRIVING THE SYSTEM DOESN T UNDERSTAND ME MOST OF THE TIMES HARD TO FIND SPECIFIC PLACES IE WALGREENS ETC I GENERALLY USE MY PHONES NAVIGATION BECAUSE OF THIS
THE VOICE COMMANDS ARE DIFFICULT TO LEARN REMEMBER I WISH THEY WERE MORE LIKE THE VOICE COMMANDS FOR IPHONES
WE RE BETTER OFF USING GOOGLE MAPS RATHER THEN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE CAR IT S NOT AFFECTIVE VERY HARD TO GET LOCATION IN THE SYSTEM
THE VOICE COMMANDS USUALLY DON T WORK AS THE SYSTEM ALWAYS MISUNDERSTANDS THE COMMAND

EASIER WAY TO INPUT NAV DATA
ITS ALL TOO COMPLICATED TO USE SWITCHING FROM FM RADIO TO SATELLITE SHOULD BE SIMPLER PLAYING A CD IS COMPLICATED
HD FM RADIO ECHOES WHEN SIGNAL GETS WEAK TEMPORARILY PREFER HARMON KARDON SYSTEM I HAD IN MY MERCEDES S550 TO THE BRUMSTER SYSTEM I NOW HAVE IN MY MERCEDES S550
BASS TREBLE SOUND SETTINGS COULD BE MORE ACCESSIBLE BECAUSE CERTAIN TRACKS ON THE IPOD NEED MORE FINE TUNING TOUGH TO GO INTO SOUND SETTINGS EACH TIME THAN HAVING TO SWITCH SCREENS BACK TO NAVIGATION WITH EVERY SONG
SELECTING MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH WHEN ACCESSING IPHONE MUSIC
NEED TOUCH SCREEN DIAL IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE AND TIME CONSUMING
IT MAY BE ME AS I NEED TO RETURN TO THE DEALER FOR MORE INSTRUCTIONS I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SIMPLY CHANGE UNSET SATELLITE RADIO STATIONS WITHOUT GOING THROUGH TOO MANY DISTRACTING STEPS

NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN IMPROVED OVER MY LAST TWO MB CARS BUT STILL HAS A WAY TO GO
NAVIGATION SYSTEM VERY POOR NOT EASY TO KEEP TURNING A DIAL MY WIFE S HONDA IS A BETTER SYSTEM DESIGN TOUCH SCREEN VOICE SYSTEM DOES NOT RESPOND WELL I CAN NOT DOWNLOAD ALL OF MY CONTACT INFORMATION INTO THE SYSTEM

TOO COMPLEX SYSTEM DOES NOT INTEGRATE WITH SIRI ON MY IPHONE THAT S A SERIOUS FLAW OUR BMW INTEGRATES VERY WELL WITH IPHONES
VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE CONTROLS WHEN GOING FROM RADIO TO PHONE ETC SYSTEM NOT INTUITIVE
ABILITY TO SPEAK THE ADDRESS AND BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION
I HAD THE NAVIGATION AS AN ADD ON SO I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS DIFFERENT IF I HAD PURCHASED THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE WITH IT ALREADY BEING INSTALLED WHEN COMPARED TO MY TOYOTA NAVIGATION IT IS MUCH EASIER TO USE BC TOYOTA OFFERS TOUCH SCREEN & SINGL
VOICE RECOGNITION IS A BIT CHALLENGING VS JUST DOING IT MANUALLY WHICH SEEMS FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE THOUGH VOICE RECOGNITION IS PREFERRED SINCE IT IS SAFER TO DO WHILE DRIVING

NO CD PLAYER PROVIDED IN MY CAR THAT IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT THE REMAINDER OF THE SOUND SYSTEM IS FINE
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE BETTER & EASIER
AN AUDIO SYSTEM THAT AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTED FOR ROAD NOISE WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT
THE NAVIGATION AND PHONE COMMANDS ARE CLUNKY AND REQUIRE MUCH MORE INPUT THAN OTHER CARS REQUIRE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ESPECIALLY CLUNKY IN THE WAY THAT IT MAKES YOU INPUT AN ADDRESS
THE USB PORT CONNECTION FOR MUSIC THROUGH PHONE IS NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT WHY WERE THE STEERING WHEEL AUDIO & STATION CONTROLS SWITCHED
I LIKE HAVING HANDS FREE PHONE AVAILABILITY
IT S NOT KEEPING UP WITH LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND I WOULD EXPECT THINGS LIKE MINI CONNECT TO BE THE STANDARD
PLACEMENT OF THE IPHONE HOLDER I WISH IT COULD BE AT EYE LEVEL FOR USING GPS THERE IS NO WHERE TO PUT IT

A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL
NAVIGATION IS VERY CUMBERSOME

BLUETOOTH
TOUCH SCREEN CAPABILITY
LOCATION OF USB PORT COULD BE BETTER A TOUCH SCREEN AUDIO SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE ALSO
PEOPLE CAN T ALWAYS HEAR ME WHEN I AM TALKING TO THEM MAYBE MICROPHONE COULD BE BETTER QUALITY OR PLACEMENT COULD BE BETTER
WHEN ON PHONE CALLS I CANNOT HEAR THE OTHER PERSON AND THEY CANNOT HEAR ME THEY ONLY HEAR STATIC
DISPLAY ON NON MINI CONNECT AUDIO SYSTEMS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED DISPLAY IS TOO SMALL ONLY OFFERS SONG TITLE NOT ENOUGH ROOM TO DISPLAY ARTIST AND OTHER INFORMATION
LARGER CONTROLS WOULD BE NICE EXTERNAL SOUND IS SOMETIMES TOO LOUD TO HEAR OVER A BLUETOOTH PHONE CALL
THE SYSTEM IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS OTHERS I HAVE SEEN IN OTHER BRANDS OF VEHICLES IT HAS TAKEN A WHILE TO GET USED TO LOOKING FORWARD TO APPLE HAVING THEIR SYSTEM AVAILABLE IN CARS
JUST INTEGRATE NAVIGATION WITH SMARTPHONE
BLUETOOTH FAR TO COMPLICATED TO HOOKUP PAIR

THE MENU SYSTEM IS LITTLE CONFUSING ESPECIALLY FOR PLAYING MUSIC FROM A DEVICE CONNECTED EITHER BY USB OR THE BLUETOOTH
SPEED LIMITS ON ROADS IS MISSING FROM THE DISPLAY WHEN IN NAV MODE ALSO THE NAV SYSTEM DOES NOT TELL YOU WHEN WHERE IS YOUR NEXT TURN UNTIL YOU ARE TOO CLOSE IT NEEDS TO STATE THE NEXT TURN EVEN IF IT IS 100 MILES AWAY SO THE DRIVER CAN REST AS

I LISTEN TO BOOKS ON DISKS AND THEY TAKE OVER 10 MINUTES TO LOAD EACH DISK WHICH IS SO SLOW THAT I HAVE TO MANUALLY LOAD EACH DISK IN ORDER TO LISTEN TO THE WHOLE BOOK ON DISK
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN COULD BE LARGER THE SIZE OF CHRYSLER PRODUCTS THE NAVIGATION SCREEN SHOULD BE BUILT INTO THE DASH INSTEAD OF LOOKING LIKE AN AFTER THOUGHT
I DON T LIKE THE SCREEN PLACEMENT IN THE MAZDA3 AT ALL I LIKE THE SET UP FOR THE RADIO IN THE MAZDA5 MUCH BETTER IT S ACTUALLY MORE OF A HAZARD TO TRY TO CHANGE STATIONS IN THE MAZDA3 THAN IT WAS IN THE MAZDA5 WHEN ONE IS DRIVING VERY HAZA
BETTER VISIBILITY OF CONTROLS WITH TOP DOWN BETTER SOUND QUALITY OUT OF SPEAKERS WITH THE TOP DOWN
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD BE NICE IF I COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE DEALERSHIP WOULD EXPLAIN THE PROCESS TO THE BUYER I WAS TOLD TO READ THE 2 INCH THICK BOOK THAT CAME WITH THE CAR AS MUCH AS I D LIKE TOO THERE
I EXPECTED SOUND QUALITY WHEN USING RADIO TO BE A LITTLE BETTER
THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK WITH THE IPHONE 6 FOR TEXT MESSAGE AND THE MAZDA SHOULD BE ABLE TO FROM WHAT I HAVE READ IT IS SOMETHING BETWEEN THE SYSTEM THAT MAZDA USES AND APPLE
MORE USER FRIENDLY NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITH BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION
THE TOUCHSCREEN DISPLAY IS MOUNTED TERRIBLY IT STICKS OUT OF THE DASH UPRIGHT WITH NO EVIDENT STYLING IT LOOKS LIKE A LARGE OLD THICK GPS MY SPOUSE AND I HAD CONCERN WHEN CONSIDERING PURCHASING THE MAZDA3 WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE WOULD TRY TO B
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS GARBAGE IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND HALF OF WHAT I SAY NO MATTER HOW I SAY IT I HAVE BEEN USING VOICE SYSTEMS FOR YEARS AND THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST I WISH I COULD BYPASS IT AND USE MY PHONE TO CONTROL THE CAR MAYBE I
MAZDA REMOVED WI FI AND INTERNET CONNECTED SERVICES FUNCTIONALITY SO THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM HAS LIMITED USEFULNESS
THE SPEAKERS ARE A JOKE WE HAVE BOSE SPEAKERS AND THEY AREN T ANY BETTER
NO CD STANDARD
IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO ADD MORE APPS TO THE SYSTEM NONE OF THE SUPPLIED APPS ARE WORTH USING
THE NAV SYSTEM FREEZES UP OR FAILS TO SHOW ALLOW POSSIBLE CONTROLS LIKE SETTINGS OR FIND ADDRESS
NO QUICK WAY TO DIAL PHONE CALLS MISS THE NUMBER BUTTONS IN PRIOR MB MODELS
BACK UP CAMERA DOES NOT WORK UNLESS RADIO OR NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ON
THE SPEAKERS SOUND SYSTEM IS NOT THE GREATEST THE MICROPHONE ISN T THE BEST EITHER
THERE IS THE HIGH QUALITY OF A BOSE MUSIC SYSTEM BUT BROUGHT DOWN BY THE VERY LOW QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS AT HIGHWAY SPEED THE CAR IS NATURALLY NOISY AND THE SPEAKERS ARE SIMPLY NOT UP TO THE TASK
WOULD HAVE LOVED A NAV SYSTEM
THE GARMIN VERSION OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ALMOST WORTHLESS NO TRAFFIC UPDATES VOICE RECOGNITION FOR IT DOES NOT WORK AND OCCASIONALLY GLITCHES I USED TO USE A GARMIN STAND ALONE UNIT THAT HAD THE ABOVE FEATURES AND NO ISSUES SO NOT SUR
MULTIPLE CD HOLDER
THE AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE AN OPTION OF USING A USB DRIVE MEMORY CARD
NOT SURE HOW TO SET FAVORITE RADIO STATIONS OR MOVE FROM SATELLITE TO FM WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE EYES OFF ROAD
I WISH I COULD PLAY SONGS ON MY IPHONE AND THE BLUETOOTH WOULD PLAY IT THROUGH THE SPEAKERS RATHER THAN HAVING TO PLUG IN MY PHONE TO PLAY MUSIC
IT DIDN T HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM OR A BACKUP CAMERA SO WE HAD AN AFTERMARKET SYSTEM INSTALLED THEREFORE WE CAN T REALLY RATE THE ONE THAT CAME WITH IT
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE CLUB EDITION HAD AN OPTION OF ADDING THE BOSE SOUND SYSTEM THE FACTORY SPEAKERS STILL SOUND GREAT AND ARE WAY BETTER THAN MY OLD CARS BUT HAVING THE OPTION OF UPGRADING WOULD BE NICE ALSO ITS I THINK IT NEEDS TO HA
WELL SPEAKERS SOUND LIKE SHIT N I DONT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM N REALLY IM JUST UNHAPPY OF THE CAR
LOUDER VOLUME EASIER CONNECTIVITY WITH BLUETOOTH AND PAIRING
THE SINGLE CD PLAYER ASPECT COULD BE BETTER LIKE HAVING MULTIPLE CD S THAT COULD BE SWITCHED OUT EASILY
USB HOOK UP FOR SMARTPHONE WORKING
TO UNDERSTAND VOICE COMMANDS BETTER SOMETIMES I REPEAT MYSELF AND THE SYSTEM STILL DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
THE PHONE PORTION IS NOT USABLE TO ME I HAVE AN ANDROID MOTOX I VE CONNECTED IT VIA BLUETOOTH AND TESTED CALLS THE OTHER PERSON SAYS IT IS NOT CLEAR WHICH WAS MY EXPERIENCE AS THE DRIVER TOO CONTROLS ARE NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND WO
BETTER & LOUDER AUDIO SYSTEM
LOW QUALITY AUDIO SYSTEM
FREE AUX CABLE WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE IF I DON T WANT TO LEAVE MY PHONE IN THE GLOVE BOX TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND I THINK BLUETOOTH SHOULD COME STANDARD
LOCATION OF THE IPOD PORT
CONTROLS NEED TO BE MORE VISIBLE WHILE DRIVING IT IS A BIG DISTRACTION TO CHANGE FROM NAVIGATION TO RADIO WHILE DRIVING
BETTER QUALITY SYSTEM AND SPEAKERS AS WELL AS MULTIPLE CD CAPABILITIES
BETTER SPEAKERS THE SOUND QUALITY IS REALLY BAD I THINK THIS IS THE ONLY THING I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT MY CAR THE DAY I BOUGHT IT I NOTICED THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE THEY WERE BLOWN BEFORE THEY WERE EVER USED
KEEP IN MY MIND THAT I AM IN MY LATE 50 S I REALIZE CHANGE IS DIFFICULT FOR ME SO I JUST USE MY PHONE FOR NAVIGATION INSTEAD OF LEARNING TO USE THE CAR S NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND I REALIZE MY AGE MAKES THE OTHER SYSTEMS LESS USER FRIENDLY FOR ME
THE NISSAN APPS WORK ONLY ABOUT 75% OF THE TIME THE NAV SYSTEM GAVE WRONG ARRIVAL TIMES
THE HANDS FREE OPTION WAS CONFUSING TO ME AT FIRST SO I JUST STOPPED TRYING I M SURE IT S NOT THAT HARD THOUGH
ASIDE FROM THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE FUSE TO THE IPHONE VIA THE USB THE SYSTEM IS GREAT FOR A STOCK SYSTEM
OPTION TO CHANGE MAP VIEW
SINCE THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK IT IS HARD TO COMMENT UNTIL IT IS FIXED AND HOPEFULLY LASTS
I DON T USE APPS NISSAN CONNECT HAS A VERY LIMITED NUMBER AND THEY DON T SEEM USEFUL RADIO SEEMS OF OK QUALITY
SMALL SCREEN NO FM HD WHEN ALL SHOULD HAVE
MAYBE ONCE A PERSON HAS ESTABLISHED THEIR PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH WITH THE VEHICLE THEY WOULDN T HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO MANY STEPS TO MAKE A CALL
PUTTING IN A BOSE SYSTEM
THE MAP AND GRAPHICS ON IT ARE NOT SO GOOD I LIKE THE ROGUE MORE ALSO THE MICROPHONE ON THE TRUCK IS NOT SO CLEAR WHEN RECIEVED I AM TOLD
THE AUDIO SYSTEM WORKS WELL BUT I WAS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN THE STEREO SOUND SYSTEM IT JUST SEEMS TO BE LACKING SOMETHING
I REALLY LIKE BEING ABLE TO HAVE MY PHONE IN THE CENTER CONSOLE BUT STILL BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO MY PLAYLISTS THAT I VE CREATED ON SPOTIFY
NAV STINKS I USE GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH TRIED VOICE COMMAND USE OF PHONE THAT ALSO STINKS
IT S FINE THE WAY IT IS IT SERVES ITS PURPOSE MY CAR ISN T THAT FANCY MEANING IT DOESN T HAVE ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES BUT A PRETTIER DISPLAY WOULD BE NICE BETTER SOUND SYSTEM LIKE BOSE OR ROCKFORD FOSGATE ETC AND I DO SEE AN OPTION TO C
STREAM MUSIC
WHEN MAKING A CALL BY VOICE COMMAND IT TAKES TO LONG BETWEEN STEPS
IMPROVE THE INTERFACE ON THE SCREEN BY A LOT MAKE VOICE WORK WITH EVERYTHING MAKE ALL PHONES WORK WITH ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM UP THE GAME OBVIOUSLY HALF ASSED THIS PART OF THE CAR
THE USB CONNECTED AUDIO DOES NOT EASILY CONNECT AND PLAY AUTOMATICALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BLUETOOTH AUDIO FROM MY PHONE DEVICE
THE NAV SYSTEM IS SLOW AND CUMBERSOME TO PROGRAM SO I NEVER USE IT GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE IS SO MUCH FASTER
SOMETIMES I HAVE TO DISCONNECT THE USB CABLE TO MAKE THE MUSIC PLAY FROM THE CAR SPEAKERS
HANDS FREE PHONE USE IS DANGEROUS WHILE DRIVING
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR ONE NAME IN PARTICULAR ABILITY TO ELIMINATE VOICE PROMPTS I E LIST OF ALL OPTIONS WANT TO SIMPLY PRESS BUTTON AND SAY CALL NAME
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK
THE BOSE SYSTEM IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE I EXPECTED MUCH RICHER SOUND
NAVI NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO TYPE FULL DESTINATION WITHOUT COMPOSING A LIST OF POSSIBLE NAVI NEEDS TO LET YOU PLUG IN THE DESIRED ROUTE VS SHORTEST DISTANCE AND LESD TIME
I CAN FAST FORWARD A CD TO THE NEXT TRACK BUT I CAN T REWIND OR FAST FORWARD TO A SPOT ON THE CURRENTLY PLAYING TRACK I HAD THIS FEATURE ON MY MAXIMA AND INFINITI AND USED IT EVERY DAY TO SKIP OVER PARTS OF SONGS OR A SPEECH AND GO BACK TO A SP
DIFFICULTY FOR USER TO COMMUNICATE CLEARLY THROUGH THE HANDS FREE SYSTEM
I HAVE NEVER HAD BLUETOOTH OR NAVIGATION AND BOTH HAVE EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS
THE PORT FOR AUX AND LOCATIONS OF ALL PLUGIN COMPONENTS
I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER VEHICLE WITHOUT APPLE S CARPLAY I REGRET THAT I COULD NOT WAIT FOR ITS AVAILABILITY AS I TRULY DISLIKE LEARNING ANOTHER INFERIOR SYSTEM AND DESPISE THE LACK OF GOOD IPHONE INTEGRATION
LARGER DISPLAY HD RADIO MORE USB PORTS AND POWER OUTLETS FRONT & BACK OF THE CAR
MAKE THE USB PORT COMPATIBLE WITH NON APPLE DEVICES
WHEN USING THE ROUTE GUIDANCE WISH THERE WAS THE OPTION TO TURN THE AUDIO DIRECTIONS OFF
NO IPHONE CONNECTIVITY VIA BLUETOOTH
EASE OF USE AND BETTER NAV
I HATE THAT MY PRESET STATION KEEP ERASING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TAKES TOO MANNY STEPS AS WELL AS THE VOICE COMMANDS FOR PHONE
PHONE VOLUME THROUGH SPEAKERS IS LOW BLUETOOTH CONNECTIONS ARE BUGGY NAVIGATION SYSTEM UPDATES SHOULD BE FREE AND QUARTERLY
NISSAN CONNECT IS HARD TO USE AND THE APPS TAKE FOREVER TO COME UP
THE APPS AVAILABLE FOR SMART PHONE OPERATIONS ARE WEAK AT BEST NOT TO MANY OPTIONS NOT IMPRESSIVE AT ALL
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UPDATED THE MAPS ARE INCORRECT AND I CAN T USE THE WEATHER UPDATES OR TRAFFIC NOTIFICATIONS IN MY CITY I CAN ONLY CHECK THE WEATHER AND TRAFFIC FOR A CITY THAT IS 2 1 2 HOURS AWAY FROM ME I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD
AREN T ANY APPS I WOULD USE DIDN T REALLY WANT NAVIGATION BUT CAME WITH PACKAGE
TWO THINGS THE FIRST IS THE QUALITY OF RECEPTION OF THE RADIO AND SPEAKERS IS NOT REALLY VERY GOOD I WOULD LIKE THE ABILITY TO ALLOW THE PASSENGER TO PROGRAM THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING THERE SHOULD BE A BUTTON OR RELEASE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM GAVE VERY INEFFECTIVE ROUTE WORST CASE IS WHEN IT INEXPLICABLY ASK ME TO EXIT FREEWAY AND THEN TAKE MULTIPLE LOCAL ROADS FOR SOME TIME ONLY TO GET BACK ON THE SAME FREEWAY LATER AND CONTINUE ON ALSO IT PICKS UNDESIRABLE ROUTE
ADD A USB PORT FOR EASY CHARGING AND CONNECTING A PHONE TO THE CAR
THE SOUND ON BOTH SIDES OF BLUETOOTH SYSTEM I AM TOLD THAT I SOUND LIKE I AM IN A TUNNEL AND THAT IT S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND ME REGARDLESS OF HOW SOFT OR LOUD I SPEAK I SOUND MUFFLED I ALSO NOTICE THAT I NEED TO TURN UP THE SOUND TO HEAR EN
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE MORE CONTROL OVER ALTERNATIVE ROUTES THE SYSTEM OFTEN DOES NOT SELECT THE BEST ROUTE THE MAP IS DIFFICULT TO READ IT IS SMALL PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO LOOK AT THE ROUTE A FEW HOURS AHEAD OF THE CAR
I DO NOT USE AUDIO COMMUNICATION AND ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM BECAUSE I AM DEAF AND I AM UNABLE TO HEAR THE MUSIC OR ANY OTHER SOUND FROM THE SYSTEM I WISH MY SUV COULD SWITCH TO NAVIGATION SYSTEM AT NO COST BECAUSE I PAID A LOT MONEY ON MY NI
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION LARGER PRE SET ON SCREEN BUTTONS LARGE SCREEN SMALL BUTTONS WHY
SOUND QUALITY OF SPEAKERS MAKE SATELLITE RADIO STANDARD
NO USB PORT
THE BLUETOOTH PHONE ANSWERING BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO AS IT S COUNTER INTUITIVE PHONE ANSWERING OPERATION SHOULD BE A HORIZONTAL OPERATION WHEN YOU ANSWER OR MAKE A CALL ONE NORMALLY HITS THE RIGHT SIDE TO CONNEC
VOICE RECOGNITION THAT WORKED ON THE PHONE MY I PHONE FAILS TO SYNC SOMETIMES STILL LEARNING THE SYSTEM
SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD IN THE XTERRA THERE IS ALSO A GOOD LAYOUT ON THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS THEY ARE VERY EASY TO USE ESPECIALLY WHILE DRIVING
ALLOW ALL CALLS MADE TO BE HEARD BY BOTH THE SENDER AND THE OTHER PARTY THE CALLS ARE ALWAYS VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY YOU CAN T HEAR EACH OTHER
I CANNOT USE THE BLUETOOTH BECAUSE OTHERS CANNOT HEAR ME
MAKE IT MUCH SIMPLER TO SEND A DESTINATION ADDRESS AND OR GPS COORDINATES FROM A COMPUTER OR PHONE TABLET MOBILE DEVICE TO THE VEHICLE S NAVIGATION SYSTEM MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO EDIT RENAME DELETE SUCH DESTINATIONS FROM THE VEHICLE S NAVIGATION SY
SPEAKER FOR BLUETOOTH SHOULD BE MORE CLEAR TO LISTENER AND LOUDER IN CAR
STANDARD BLUETOOTH DOES NOT INCLUDE VOICE COMMANDS E G HAVE TO SELECT A PHONE NUMBER FROM DIRECTORY BY PUSHING A BUTTON NOT EXACTLY HANDS FREE SEEMS PORSCHE IS BEHIND OTHER CAR MANUFACTURERS IN THIS AREA
OVERALL SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT BUT SOME SIMPLE CONTROLS COULD HAVE BEEN MORE FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGNED BETTER TO MAKE THEM MORE INTUITIVE AND USABLE NAVIGATION IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY AUDI WHICH IS OWNED BY THE SAME PARENT COMPANY
VOICE CONTROLS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO LEARN TO USE NAVIGATION IS ENTIRELY TOO COMPLICATED AND CUMBERSOME TO BOTHER WITH ANTIQUATED TECHNOLOGY
BLUETOOTH AUDIO QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS SOME COMPETITORS MAZDA TO BE SPECIFIC HAVE ALSO HEARD THAT OUTGOING PHONE CALL RECEPTION IS POOR WHICH COULD INDICATE POOR PLACEMENT OF INTERIOR MICROPHONE OR EVEN PERHAPS INFERIOR QUALITY OF INTERIOR M
I CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE ENTERTAINMENT APPLICATIONS AND SOUND QUALITY ON BLUETOOTH IS POOR
THE ABILITY TO OPERATE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING ALLOWING THE DRIVER VIA TAKING ON THEIR OWN RISK OR AT LEAST THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER TO MAKE CHANGES WITHOUT STOPPING
HANDS FREE PHONE CLARITY
I USE THE PHONE FEATURE THE MOST I WISH IT HAD A TOUCH PAD THE OTHER DAY I WAS CALLING TO REPORT A GAS LEAK AND COULDN T PRESS ONE OR ANYTHING TO COMPLETE THE CALL HAD TO YOU MY IPHONE WHICH IS AGAINST THE LAW IN DC
RADIO MUST BE ON TO USE NAVIGATION DISLIKE
SOUND QUALITY WHILE ON TELEPHONE
BEST AUDIO AND POOR NAVI
BLUETOOTH WOULD HELP
NO BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
SMART HAS AN I PHONE APP THAT INTEGRATES THE PHONE WITH THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IN THE VEHICLE THEY NEED TO DEVELOP ONE FOR THE ANDROID USERS OF THE WORLD
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FROM IPHONE 6 ALSO IT IS IRITATING THE OUTSIDE TEMP DISPLAY IS COVERED WHEN ON THE PHONE
BETTER INTEGRATION WITH ANDROID PHONES
THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE BLUETOOTH
NAVIGATION IS THE ONE ASPECT OF THE CAR THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT I THINK AN UPGRADED SYSTEM OR INTEGRATION WITH GOOGLE MAPS WOULD MAKE IT VASTLY SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER NAVIGATION SYSTEM AVAILABLE CURRENTLY THE DIFFICULTY IN SETTING UP ROUTE GUID
THE TRAFFIC INFORMATION IS COMPLETELY RANDOM AND UNHELPFUL THE NAVIGATION IS POOR AT BEST AND CAN ONLY BE CONTROLLED THROUGH VOICE WHILE DRIVING IT IS ESSENTIALLY WORTHLESS
OUTDATED PRESSURE TOUCH SCREENS UNRESPONSIVE NOT WORTH THE PRICE MODERNIZE
OPTION FOR A SCREEN WITHOUT NAVIGATION THAT DIALYSIS INCOMING CALLS AND SONG TITLES ALSO FOUR STANDARD SPEAKER SYSTEM WOULD BE FAR BETTER THAN THE HEADPHONE STYLE DUAL SPEAKER SYSTEM
ALLOW USE OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM BY PASSENGER ENTERING ADDRESS ZOOMING ETC WHILE CAR IS BEING DRIVEN
REMOVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND LINK THE CAR S DISPLAY AND TOUCH CONTROLS DIRECTLY TO MY IPHONE
I VE HAD SOME DIFFICULTY ESTABLISHING A CONNECTION AFTER PRESSING THE HANDS FREE AUDIO BUTTON TO CONNECT TO MY PHONE I ALSO DON T LIKE THE DISPLAY ON THE DASH AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO PRESS THE OPTION YOU WANT WHILE DRIVING IT WOULD BE BETTER IF
I DON T LIKE THE SIZE AND BRIGHTNESS OF THE DISPLAY FOR THE A V AND BACK UP CAMERA I THINK IT S DISTRACTING ALSO FOR SAFETY I HAVE NEVER USED ANY OF THE CAR S MOBILE PHONE FEATURES
IF THE READIO CAN TELL ME ARTIST AND SONG ON XM AND ON MY IPOD AND OUR LOCAL RADIO STATIONS DO BROADCAST ARTIST AND SONG MY AUDII SEES THIS INFO WHY CAN T MY SUBARU TELL ME ARTIST AND SONG ON FM
NEED TACTILE BUTTONS TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO OPERATE WHILE DRIVING
NOT TOO WAVY WITH IT YET TO RESPOND INTELLIGENTLY WOULD LIKE EASIER WAY TO LOG IN ALL PHONE NUMBERS I COULD USE VERSUS ENTERING ONE BY ONE SO REPETITIVE
RECEPTION OF THE RADIO STATIONS AGAIN COMPARING THIS TO MY OTHER VEHICLES WHERE I GET GOOD RECEPTION FOR SAME STATIONS WHILE DRIVING IN SAME LOCATIONS
THE DISPLAY IS HARD TO USE AND REALLY HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING THE AUDIO NAVIGATION SYSTEM SPLIT SCREEN IS HARD TO GET TO THE AUDIO SIDE TO CHANGE RADIO STATIONS IT ALSO LOCKS YOU OUT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS DRIVING TO NAVIGATE TO SOMETHING ELSE
TOUCH SCREEN USE CAN BE DISTRACTING REAL BUTTONS TO CHANGE SELECTIONS WOULD BE BETTER
I CAN T USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION AT ALL IT KEEPS ASKING ME TO REPEAT MYSELF THE NAVIGATION IS GREAT BUT AT TIMES HARD TO USE
I HATE THAT I HAVE TO USE AN EXTERNALLY CONNECTED SIRIUS RADIO ITS HAZARDOUS AND THE FRONT COMPARTMENT IS SMALL ENOUGH NOW I HAVE HAD TO HAVE EXTRA WIRES UNSIGHTLY AND AN EXTRA DEVICE NO WHERE CONVENIENT TO MOUNT I M CANCELLING SIRIUS AND
ADD STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS SCROLLING UP AND DOWN THROUGH STATIONS USING CONTROLS ON THE WHEEL WOULD BE SAFER THAN USING THE TOUCH SCREEN
NOT VERY QUICK RESPONSE TO TOUCH CONTROL
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION SOMETIMES IT HAS TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING ME
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CAN BE BEAT BY A FREE APP THIS NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN WORKED ON BETTER THIS IS THE ONLY THING I REGRET WITH THE CAR IT DID COME WITH A BACK UP CAMERA SO I M HAPPY I HAVE THAT
NO TOUCH SCREEN
HANDS FREE SYSTEM IS CLUNKY SOUND SYSTEM IS FINE BUT NOTHING EXCEPTIONAL COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES
FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE VOICE RECOGNITION
VOICE RECOGNITION USUALLY REQUIRES VERBAL REPETITION
SETTING A DESTINATION IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE
THE USB PORT IS BURIED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CONSOLE WHICH BY ITSELF IS LOCATED TOO FAR BACK FOR THE DRIVER TO USE AT ALL WHILE DRIVING
ONCE IN AHA OR PANDORA HARD TO CHSNGE THE SOURCE HAVE TO SWITCH OFF DISCONNECT USB CORD NOT SIMPLE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN TRYING TO MAKE AN PHONE CALL IS TERRIBLE AND DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY NAMES
A MORE AFFORDABLE HIGH END BRAND NAME SOUND SYSTEM WITH NAVIGATION AND SATELLITE RADIO
AGAIN THE LOCATION AND NUMBER OF USB PORTS I DO WANT TO SAY THAT PART OF THE REASON I WENT WITH SUBARU THOUGH WAS BECAUSE OF THE UNCLUTTERED NONDISTRACTING   MINIMAL BUTTONS ON THE DASH CONSOLE
AUDIO SYSTEM HEAD UNIT AND SPEAKER PRODUCES SOUND WHICH HAS BELOW AVERAGE ACOUSTIC QUALITY
PANDORA DOESN T SYNC CONSISTENTLY PROBLEMS CONNECTING MY PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH
NAV SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW BUT FUNCTIONAL I MIGHT USE IT FOR LONGER TRIPS BUT I GENERALLY RELY ON MY PHONE FOR MY NAVIGATION NEEDS
THE BLUETOOTH IS AWESOME AND I USE THIS DAILY WITH THE PANDORA APP SOME MORE APPS WOULD BE NICE
VOICE COMMANDS OFTEN HAVE ERRORS
WHAT YOU CAN CONTROL FROM THE STEERING WHEEL IS LIMITED BUT I HAVE NOT TRIED THE VOICE CONTROL FEATURES
WOULD LIKE TO PUT MORE THAN ONE CD IN AT A TIME
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW TO START IT TAKES ME 15 MINUTES JUST TO ENTER A DESTINATION AND GET A ROUTE SELECTED I NEVER USE IT BECAUSE OF THIS THE AUDIO CONTROL CAN BE A LITTLE CUMBERSOME AT TIMES I SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE ALL THE SOURC
THE NAVIGATION INTERFACE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO GET GOING WITH FEWER STEPS I HAVE USED SEVERAL WINDSHIELD MOUNT GARMIN PRODUCTS THAT DO THIS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL ALSO NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE SONGS WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH FIVE STEPS BECAUSE YO
THE BLUETOOTH SUCKS THE EYESIGHT IS PHENOMENAL THE RADIO HAS FAIRLY POOR RECEPTION
CONTROLS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN ARE SMALL AND CUMBERSOME TO OPERATE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SAFELY OPERATE WHILE DRIVING
WISH NAV WAS EASIER TO USE AND UPDATED ITSELF
NAVIGATION REQUIRES TOO MUCH TYPING WHY CAN Y IT BE EASIER TO USE LIKE GOOGLE MAPS I AM A HUGE GOOGLE USER MAPS MAIL PLAY MUSIC I ALSO AM A HUGE IHEART RADIO USER AND I CAN ONLY GET TO THAT APP THROUGH MANY TOUCHES OF BUTTONS T
THE SPEAKERS ARE A HUGE UPGRADE FROM THE SUBARU IMPREZA OUTBACK SPORT THAT I PREVIOUSLY HAD HOWEVER I BELIEVE THE SPEAKERS COULD STILL BE BETTER THE ONLY OTHER COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THAT I CAN T NAVIGATE SATELLITE RADIO STATIONS USING THE S
SOUND QUALITY NEEDS IMPROVED
A NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT IS EASY TO USE WITH EASY TO UNDERSTAND DIRECTIONS AND ONE THAT OWNERS DO NOT HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE UPDATED ALSO A SYSTEM THAT CAN BE TURNED OFF WITHOUT HAVING TO STOP MAYBE OFFERING A CLASS TO TEACH OWNERS HOW TO USE THES
NOT SURE I LIKE THE WAY THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOWS ME DRIVING ON THE MAP IN THE DIRECTION I AM DRIVING EXAMPLE WHEN I AM TRAVELING SOUTH MY CAR IS POINTING DOWN PREFER TO ALWAYS SEE MY CAR GOING UP SO I KNOW IF I AM MAKING A RIGHT OR A LE
IT DOES NOT SOUND LIKE ALL SPEAKERS WORK VOICE RECOGNITION IS HARD TO USE
THE TOUCH CONTROL HAS DIFFICULTY OF RECOGNIZING COMMANDS SOMETIMES
VOICE RECOGNITION IS SPOTTY SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE WHEN USING HANDS FREE IT OFTEN CUTS OUT FOR PEOPLE AT THE OTHER END PROBABLY DUE TO THE AUTO MUTE FUNCTION
TOUCH SCREEN GIVES NO TACTILE FEEDBACK SO IT S HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING YOU CAN T CONTROL IT BY FEEL LIKE YOU CAN WITH PHYSICAL PUSH BUTTON CONTROLS LOTS OF GOOD FUNCTIONALITY BUT WOULD LIKE IT TO BE EASIER TO CONTROL THE THINGS I DO MOST
THE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS HAVE SIGNIFICANT DELAY RESPONSE TIME SHOULD BE FASTER
SOUND QUALITY OF PHONE CALLS FOR BOTH PARTIES
THE VOICE SOUND OF THE HANDSFREE SYSTEM IS A LITTLE CHOPPY AND IT S PITCH IS A LITTLE CREEPY I WISH YOU COULD ADJUST HAVE DIFFERENT VOICES TO CHOOSE FROM OR A WAY TO CREATE A MORE APPEALING VOICE FOR THE SYSTEM A WAY TO CUSTOMISE IT TO YOUR
SETTINGS FOR MAPS ARE DIFFICULT TO FIND SHOULD BE EASIER TO TYPE SPEAK DESTINATION IN AND NAVIGATE
BLUETOOTH LINKAGE TO MORE THAN ONE PHONE AT A TIME
DO NOT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY POOR IN THE MOST DIFFICULT NAVIGATION SITUATIONS SUCH AS A LIMITED ACCESS HIGHWAY NEAR A BIG CITY IT OFTEN SEEMS TO HAVE A MISTAKEN LOCATION OR A MISMATCH BETWEEN LOCATION AND MAY IT OFTEN GIVES ERRONEOUS DIRECT
I DON T LIKE THAT YOU ARE LIMITED TO WHAT CAN BE DONE BASED ON IF THE CAR IS IN DRIVE OR NOT I UNDERSTAND THE SAFTEY FEATURE BUT SOMETIMES YOUR PASSENGER IS TRYING TO ENTER INFO ON THE NAVIGATION WHILE IN DRIVE AND THE SYSTEM WILL NOT ALLOW IT
APPLE IPOD INTEGRATION IS PRIMITIVE PODCASTS DON T SHOW PROPERLY ON SCREEN
THE NAVIGATION IS TO HARD TO USE OR FIGURE OUT
VOICE CONTROLS ABSOLUTELY SUCK THEY SHOULD JUST USE SIRI ON MY PHONE INSTEAD OF WHATEVER CRAPPY VERSION THEY ARE USING
I PREFER MY FREESTANDING GARMIN OVER THE FACTORY NAVAGATION
A 10 YEAR OLD COULD HAVE PROGRAMMED THIS SYSTEM BETTER ABSOLUTELY COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT I AM A SOFTWARE ENGINEER AND I HAVE ESTIMATED TO HAVE EXPERIENCED OVER 100 DIFFERENT BUGS WITH THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM IT IS ALMOST UNUSABLE AND WILL D
NAV COULD BE A LITTLE EASIER TO LEARN
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO USE VEHICLE AUDIO SYSTEM CONTROLS TO FAST FORWARD OR REWIND PODCASTS AND MUSIC PLAYED FROM A CONNECTED DEVICE SKIP BACK OR FORWARD 15 SECONDS CONTROLS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR PODCAST LISTENING
YOU CAN IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND PHONE DON T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHAT I M SAYING
NAVIGATION SCREEN IS TOO COMPLICATED IT USES PICTURES INSTEAD OF WORDS FOR BUTTONS SO YOU HAVE TO GUESS WHAT THE FUNCTION IS THIS COULD BE SIMPLIFIED EASILY SAME GOES FOR AUDIO CONTROLS IT NEEDS TO BE NEATER AND SIMPLIFIED
BLUETOOTH NOT FULLY COMPATABLE WITH ALL CEL PHONES
EVERYTHING EXCEPT VOICE RECOGNITION WORKS
EXPECTED HIGHER QUALITY SOUND FROM HARMAN KARDON SYSTEM THE INABILITY TO CHANGE FROM ALL 12 SPEAKERS AS SURROUND SOUND TO STANDARD STEREO IS A DISAPPOINTMENT VOICE COMMANDS RECOGNITION ARE BAD ENOUGH THAT I DON T USE THEM
I LOVE THE HANDS FREE PHONE FEATURES
VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE EASIER TO USE
CONNECTING TO BLUETOOTH DEVICES
TOUCH SCREEN A BIT DIFFICULT MAY NEED TO TOUCH THE SCREEN 2 3X BEFORE THE CHANGE IS MADE
DO NOT HAVE NAV OR VOICE CONTROL HEAT AND AIR
THE STEREO SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESUME PLAYING THE FLASH DRIVE RIGHT WHERE IT LEFT OFF I HAVE THE BASIC 6 SPEAKER SYSTEM AND IT IS NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH THERE SHOULD BE SPEAKERS IN THE REAR WINDOW DECK FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT I CAN REALLY ONLY HEAR TH
WISH I COULD EASILY ADJUST THE BASS OR OTHER FEATURES OF THE SOUND SYSTEM HAS A DIFFERENT AUDIO SYSTEM THEN WHAT I WAS USED TO PREVIOUSLY I VE GOTTEN USED TO THIS NEW ONE STILL WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE IT MORE SIMPLE
VOICE RECOGNITION STINKS DOESN T WORK CORRECTLY
BETTER SPEAKERS BLUETOOTH THAT UNDERSTANDS VOICE COMMANDS BETTER
SOUND FROM SATELLITE RADIO IN USB PORT CANNOT GET LOUD ENOUGH
QUALITY AND CONNECTIVITY OF PHONE CALLS
THE INTERFACE CAN BE COMPLETELY OVERHAULED I FIND IT TO BE VERY CHALLENGING TO NAVIGATE AND USE I ALSO FIND THE INFORMATION DISPLAYED ESPECIALLY USING SATELLITE RADIO IS MINIMAL I AM AN EXTREMELY TECHNICAL PERSON SO FOR ME TO SAY THIS IS A
THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION GETS LOST OFTEN AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO KEEP SETTING IT UP
ONE THING IS THAT WHEN YOU TURN ON THE HEADLIGHTS THE AUDIO ENTERTAINMENT TOUCHPANEL IS DIMMED SO IF YOU DRIVE WITH YOUR HEADLIGHTS ON DURING THE DAYTIME IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE TOUCHSCREEN IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE IF THE CLOCK WAS A LARG
THE IPHONE CONNECTIVITY IS TERRIBLE MUCH WORSE THAN MUCH CHEAPER CARS I GET AS RENTALS IN THE END I GAVE UP TRYING TO CONNECT MY IPHONE BECAUSE THE MINI SUPPLIED ACCESSORY DIDN T EVEN WORK THE DEALER COULDN T EVEN FIX IT *VERY* DISAPPOINTING
THE STEREO SYSTEM IS RATHER PEDESTRIAN NOT VERY EXCITING DESIGN ELEMENTS
THE CONNECTED FEATURE ONLY WORKS IF YOU HAVE AN IPHONE I HAVE AN ANDROID THE HANDS FREE VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK AT ALL IT IS USELESS I HAVE TRIED EVERY COMMAND AND IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANYTHING THAT I OR ANYONE ELSE IN MY FAM
THE VOICE RECOGNITION ON TEXTING I ALREADY MENTIONED BUT IT DOESN T SEEM TO RECOGNIZE WORDS LIKE REPLY ON A FAIR NUMBER OF OCCASIONS ALSO I SEEM TO HAVE TO GET THE VOLUME ON THE RADIO TURNED UP A LOT HIGHER THAN I THINK IS NORMAL TO BE ABLE
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE RADIO AND CD IN THE VEHICLE THE SOUND QUALITY IS VERY NICE
I USE THE HANDS FREE PHONE A LOT THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR FINDING RADIO STATIONS IS NOT USEFUL TO ME AS IT TAKES MY EYES OFF THE ROAD MORE SO THAN THE OLD TYPE WHERE YOU COULD PRESS SCAN AND FIND A STATION YOU LIKE WITHOUT GOING THROUGH SEVERAL ME
I FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO USE THERE WERE AT LEAST 5 TIMES IT GAVE ME AN INCORRECT ROUTE WHICH FAILED TO GUIDE ME TO MY DESTINATION I ACTUALLY HAVE NOT BEEN USING IT AND AM JUST USING GOOGLE MAP ON MY IPHONE AS GUIDAN
VOICE COMMANDS TO PHONE LINK COULD BE BETTER
DOES NOT HAVE AUX JACK
VOICE PROMPTS DIFFICULT TO SET UP IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE THE PHONE BOOK IN MY PHONE SAMSUNG GALAXY 5
BLUETOOTH DOESN T ALWAYS RESPOND TO WHAT I AM ASKING IT TO CALL
DONT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
JUST HAVE DIFFICULTY SETTING UP THE STATIONS I WANT ON THE SATELLITE RADIO FORGET HOW TO DO IT IT S ME GETTING OLD NOT THE SYSTEM
HAVE SATELLITE RADIO AVAILABLE WITHOUT HAVING TO UPGRADE TO THE HIGHER TRIM LEVEL
XM RADIO SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT
ITS ALL GOOD EXCEPT THE VOICE REGOGNITION NEEDS A LITTLE WORK SUCH AS SPEECH RECOGNITION AND MAKING IT EASIER TO CALL OR CHANGE SOMTHING
THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS GREAT IN THE MIT OUTLANDER MY ONLY QUALM WITH IT IS THAT WHEN I MAKE HANDS FREE CALLS THE PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CALL GENERALLY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME HEARING ME
DEFINITELY A BETTER BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WHEN USING THE PHONE PEOPLE TELL ME MY VOICE SOUNDS LIKE SYLVESTER THE CAT
REDESIGN THE TOUCH SCREEN LOOKS CHEAP
WHEN DRIVING PEOPLE OFTEN TELL ME THEY CAN T HEAR ME VERY WELL WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE SYSTEM
LOVE THE SIRIUS RADIO AND THE TOUCH PANEL TO CONTROL AUDIO   ENTERTAINMENT APPS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS NOT THE BEST EVEN AFTER CALIBRATION I WISH I COULD USE APPS IN MY TOYOTA THE SPEAKERS ARE OK NOT GREAT AND NOT TERRIBLE JUST OK
GOOD SPEAKER QUALIT AND EASY WITH WITH BLUETOOTH DEVICE DIFFICULT TO MOVE CONTROLS ON AUDIO UNIT WITH BLUETOOTH
WISH IT WAS EASIER TO SEE RADIO AND PHONE FROM DRIVER S SEAT ANGLING WOULD HELP THINK I SAW A PICTURE OF THAT I HAVE A VERY BASIC MODEL I HAVE TRIED TO PUT MY IPOD IN TO PLAY BUT I CANNOT FIGURE IT OUT YET JUST DON T QUITE KNOW HOW TO TELL
I CAN T GET THE TEXT MESSAGING TO WORK AND I VE TRIED TO SET IT UP MULTIPLE TIMES IT WORKS FINE ON MY HUSBANDS PHONE THOUGH THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T SEEM TO RECOGNIZE WHAT I M SAYING SO IT S EASIER TO DO IT MYSELF
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THE TRAFFIC FUNCTION TAKES ABOUT 30MINUTES TO UPLOAD BY THE TIME IT S READY I M ALREADY AT WORK
I D RATHER USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN MY SMARTPHONE IT S ALWAYS UP TO DATE THE CARS SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY BECOME OUT OF DATE OVER TIME
NAVIGATION IS NOT AS INTUITIVE AS IT COULD BE STILL NO IDEA HOW TO SHUT OFF NAVIGATION ROUTE HAVE ONLY FOUND HOW TO PAUSE IT
BE ABLE TO HAVE THE PASSENGER PROGRAM NAV SYSTEM WHILE VEHICLE IN MOTION BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY ISSUE SO I ACCEPT IT
SOUND QUALITY WAS BETTER IN MY VW VOLUME IS NOT VERY LOUD
TOO COMPLICATED FOR THE OLDER CROWD WHO DIDN T GROW UP WITH A CELL PHONE AT 3 YRS OLD
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT ALWAYS RESPOND TO COMMANDS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM REALLY DOES NOT WORK WELL AT ALL WHEN SPEAKING A STREET NAME INTO THE SYSTEM THE SYSTEM GETS IT WRONG 95% OF THE TIME SO WE DON T USE VOICE RECOGNITION AT ALL WE HAVEN T TAKEN IT TO THE DEALER BECAUSE WE GET THE
I MISS HAVING THE MULTIPLE CD PLAYER I DON T HAVE AN MP 3 PLAYER OR IPOD SO I HAVE NOT USED THOSE FEATURES
IT WOULD BE NICE TO ENTER A DESTINATION WITHOUT HAVING THE VEHICLE IN PARK OFTEN TIMES THE PASSENGER AND NOT THE DRIVER CAN ENTER THE DESTINATION AFTER THE TRIP HAS BEGUN WASTES TIME TO ENTER NEW DESTINATION IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE NAV LADY SPEAKS OVER ANY OTHER AUDIO INCLUDING CELL PHONE CALLS THERE IS NO WAY TO QUICKLY MUTE THE NAV LADY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CHALLENGING AND FRUSTRATING AT TIMES VOICE ACTIVATION SYSTEM IS A VERY NICE FEATURE FOR HANDS FREE PHONE USE
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TELL AUDIO THE ADDRESS INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BEFORE OR WHILE DRIVING IT WILL ONLY LET YOU GO TO A PLACE YOU HAVE ALREADY BEEN I WENT TO A PLACE THAT I THOUGHT I KNEW WHERE IT WAS BUT WAS ON THE WRONG STREET IN

NAVIGATION IS HARD TO LEARN HOW TO USE
THE ENTUNE CONNECTIVITY DOESN T WORK ALL OF THE TIME
A HUGE NEGATIVE IS THE LACK OF THE SET SPEED LIMIT IN THE ZONE I M DRIVING IN WHERE ALL THE SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD HAVE THEM NOW NO TEXT MSG READING OR DICTATION OPTION VERY LIMITED APPS AND CAN NOT BE CUSTOMIZED LACK OF WIFI OPTION IN THIS PRICE
SHOULD BE EASIER TO PROGRAM ROUTES
I CAN NOT STAND VOICE COMMANDS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO SPEAK AN EXACT COMMAND THAT IT WILL ONLY UNDERSTAND 50% OF THE TIME WE ARE HUMANS WE REQUIRE FLEXIBILITY AND EASY WAYS TO DISCOVER COMMANDS VOICE COMMANDS MUST GET MORE CONVERSATIONAL TO TR
AUDIO SYSTEM COULD SOUND BETTER SOUNDS A BIT WEAK
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE SPEED AND RED LIGHT CAMERA WARNINGS AS DO OFF THE SHELF SYSTEMS
GIVE ME BACK THE ENTUNE IT HAD GPS NAVIGATION THE SYSTEM I CURRENTLY HAVE HAS A NAVIGATION THAT CAN ONLY BE USED WHEN YOU ARE IN A CITY THAT HAS THE HD I DO NOT SO WHAT USE IS IT TO ME IF I CANNOT USE IT WHEN I NEED IT
VOICE RECOGNITION IS HIT OR MISS NO QUICK EASY WAY TO TURN OFF NAVIGATION AT ANY TIME
THE SOUND QUALITY CHANGES DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF DEVICE YOU USE FOR AUDIO IF I AM USING MY BLUETOOTH TO CONNECT MY PHONE TO LISTEN TO MUSIC THE SOUND QUALITY ISN T GREAT BUT IF IT IS PLUGGED INTO THE USB PORT IT SOUNDS BETTER THE SAME THIN
TOO MANY TOUCH SCREENS TOO COMPLICATED AND A DISTRACTION
THE SOUND QUALITY FROM THE BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTION
1 THE SOUND QUALITY CAN IMPROVE THE VOLUME SETTING IS TOO LOW I NEED TO PUT IT UP TO ABOUT 30 FOR AVERAGE SOUND 2 WHEN MY PHONE IS CONNECTED TO GOOGLE MAPS THE BLUETOOTH SYNCS WITH MY PHONE AND THE DISPLAY CHANGES TO AS IF I M MAKING A PHONE
GPS IS A KILLER FOR THE RATING IN THIS CATEGORY BIG STEP BACKWARDS IN A MARKET WHERE EVERY CELL PHONE HAS GOOGLE MAPS CONNECTIVITY OF DEVICES IN THE CENTER CONSOLE UNFORGIVABLE ENTUNE FEATURE OF PANDORA DOES NOT WORK AND IS A KNOWN ISSUE
LARGER TOUCH ICONS FOR RADIO PRESETS
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS HARD TO CHANGE FAT FINGERS
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET ENSURE SO I CAN GET TRAFFIC INFORMATION I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET IT INSTALLED THERE IS NOTHING THAT HAS CLEARLY GIVEN ME THE INFORMATION I NEED TO USE THIS DIMENSION OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
EASE OF USE OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO LOWER THE SOUND IN THE FRONT SPEAKERS AND INCREASE THE SOUND IN THE REAR SPEAKERS
I CAN T HEAR MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ON THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE IN THE CAR AT ALL THEY ALSO COMPLAIN TO ME OF AN ECHO THAT DISTORTS MY WORDS
RADIO SIGNAL IS POOR AND CAN NOT USE VOICE RECOGNITION IT SUCKS THE NAVIGATION IS GREAT EXCEPT IT SHOULD TELL YOU WHAT ROAD YOU ARE GOING TO TURN ON SOONER
IF THE PASSENGER AIR BAG IS DETECTING A PASSENGER IN THAT SEAT I BELIEVE ALL CONTROLS FOR ALL FEATURES INCLUDING NAVIGATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE USED I UNDERSTAND NOT ALLOWING THE DRIVER TO DO SUCH THINGS WHILE VEHICLE IS MOVING BUT IT WOULD
SWITHING FROM OUT OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AFTER REACHING DESTINATION IS CONFUSING EITHER I M NOT DOING IT PROPERLY OR IT TAKES SEVERAL STEPS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE AUDIO IS GREAT BUT THE GPS IS SECOND RATE

TOUCH SCREEN DOES NOT RESPOND AT TIMES
VOICE CONTROL DOESN T ALWAYS WORK
DIRECTION FOR USING LOADING APPS ETC
NAVIGATION CONTROLS WHILE ENROUTE ARE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND
THREE THINGS PERTAINING TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM 1 A MORE CLEARLY WRITTEN MANUAL IT NEVER EXPLAINED THAT YOU CAN T USE CERTAIN FEATURES WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN DRIVE 2 THE ONLY WAY TO CANCEL ROUTE GUIDANCE IS THROUGH VOICE CONTROL THERE SH
EASE OF USE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS THE BIGGEST DETRACTOR AT THIS STAGE THOUGH I PROBABLY NEED TO STUDY THE USER MANUAL TO FIGURE OUT TO GET THE MOST OUT OF IT
THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS COULD BE GRATELY IMPROVED AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION
YOUR SYSTEM IS INFERIOR TO FORD SYNC IN DISPLAY SIZE COLOR SCREEN
SUCH A LARGE VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE MUCH LARGER SCREENS MOSTLY IN DASH BUT ALSO FOR REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM
I DON T NEED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TALKING TO ME EVERY TEN SECONDS
THERE SHOULD BE A WAY THE PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT COULD OPERATE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING
THE TRAFFIC ALERTS ALWAYS SAY NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE WHEN I AM TRY TO ACCESS IT AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE WHICH I DON T UNDERSTAND SINCE I WAS TOLD THIS WAS ALL DONE BY SATELITE SO IT SHOULD BE ACCURATE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOLUME IS BURIED AND DIFFICULT TO FIND QUICKLY TO ADJ VOLUME VERY ANNOYING
SIMPLER INSTRUCTIONS FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE NOT TECH WHIZZES
CHANGE NAVIGATION INTERFACE TO ALLOW FULL CONTROL BY PASSENGER WHILE VEHICLE IS MOVING IMPROVE NAVIGATION INTERFACE AND EASE OF USE IN GENERAL MORE LIKE GARMIN AND KENWOOD
THE TRAFFIC ALERT I E RED YELLOW GREEN LINES NEXT TO ROADS COULD BE MORE ACCURATE
FUNCTIONALITY OF APPS ESPECIALLY MAP IS SO FAR INFERIOR TO CURRENT SMART PHONE TECHNOLOGY THAT IT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS TO USE MOST OF THE APPS AND FEATURES
DITCH INSTALLED NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND ALLOW SCREEN TO SHOW IPHONE APP NAVIGATION WAZE
QUALITY OF THE HANDS FREE CALLING
THE SOUND SYSTEM IS WEAK IT HAS NO POWER THE VOICE COMMANDS NEVER WORK
DOES NOT READ TEXT IN A TIMELY MANNER DIFFICULT TO CHANGE AUDIO SOURCES WHILE DRIVING
PLEASE SEND VIDEO TO THE FRONT SCREEN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR PARENTS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT TO START A NEW MOVIE FOR THE CHILDREN IN THE BACK WITHOUT STRETCHING THEIR BACKS OR BREAKING THEIR NECKS TRYING TO SEE WHAT S ON THE REAR VIDEO MONITOR
THERE IS A SAFETY FEATURE THAT DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO SCROLL THROUGH THE RADIO CHANNELS AS YOU DRIVE WHEN THERE IS A PASSENGER IN THE VEHICLE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THAT FEATURE
VOICE CONTROLS WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A CALL WORK BUT DON T RECOGNIZE COMMANDS WHEN USING TOUCH SCREEN FOR MAKING CALLS WORKS GREAT
TOO DIFFICULT TO SWITCH TO AM FM BLUETOOTH STATION CHANNELS TOO CLOSE TOGETHER TO SELECT WITH TOUCHSCREEN SAME WITH ARROWS TO GET TO NEXT SET OF CHANNELS
SPEAKERS ARE CHEAP TOUCH SCREEN IS CLUNKY OVERALL LOOK IS DATED
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TENDS TO LOSE CONNECTION FREQUENTLY
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS SMALL FOR ME
BETTER DETAILED NAVAGATION MAPS WOULD BENEFIT OPERATIONS
NAVIGATION CONTROL FOR PASSENGER WHILE IN MOTION AND FRONT CONTROLS FOR DVD PLAYER
NAVIGATION ROUTES OFTEN DON T AVOID HEAVY TRAFFIC
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BLUETOOTH MAP FOR WINDOWS PHONE
VOICE RECOGNITION NEVER UNDERSTANDS WHAT I AM SAYING
VEHICLE HAS TO BE STOPPED TO DO MANY FUNCTIONS ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE RADIO WAS BETTER IN THE MODEL
UPDATED POINT OF INTEREST AND ADDRESS IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM ADDITIONALLY SHOULD BE FREE UPDATES INSTEAD OF FEE TO UPDATE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
USE OF THE NAVIGATION WHILE MOVING THERE IS A SENSOR FOR THE PASSENGER AIR BAG WHY NOT TAP INTO THAT SENSOR AND ALLOW NAVIGATION IF THERE IS A PASSENGER
ON THE NAV SIDE BE ABLE TO INPUT ONLY TOWN NAMES INSTEAD OF HAVING TO HAVE AN EXACT ADDRESS
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BETTER SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM CONCERTS FOR PHONEI WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BETTER SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM CONCERTS FULL SOUND
A BETTER SOUND EQUALIZER
NAV SYSTEM DOES NOT TELL YOU TURNS IN ADVANCE
WHEN TALKING ON THE PHONE WITH THE BLUETOOTH THE SPEAKERS CAN GET VERY FUZZY AT HIGHER VOLUMES
NAVIGATION SYSTEM GENERALLY NEEDS TO BE BETTER SHOULD BE EASY TO USE LIKE GOOGLE MAPS
SPEAKERS PUT IN ON THE PASSENGER SIDE SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE USING HANDS FREE ANYONE CAN TALK AND STILL BE HEARD
PHONE CONNECTIVITY
I ONLY USE THE FM RADIO ONCE IN AWHILE WHILE MY WIFE IS SHOPPING OTHER WISE I NEVER TURN IT ON
NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS A LAG ON THE TRAFFIC AND COULD USE BETTER ROUTING TO ARRIVE AT YOUR DESTINATION FASTER I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING
RADIO IS ALL I USE IT IS FINE DID NOT USE THE SUBSCRIPTION HD RADIO THAT WAS OFFERED
AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE NAV SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO PROGRAM IF THE LOCATION YOU WANT IS NOT IN THE SYSTEM S PROGRAM THIS HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE LOCAL TECHNICIAN BUT CANNOT BE FIXED UNTIL A NEW MAP CARD COMES OUT WHENEVER AND THEN THEY
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS SOME IMPROVEMENT
PROBABLY DID NOT GET THE AUDIO SYSTEM I WANTED NOT SURE WHY THEY ARE MARKETED AS PREMIUM SOUND AND JBL PREMIUM SOUND DEFINITELY LACKING IN THE AUDIO DEPARTMENT I DO NOT LIKE THE OPERATION OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND GENERALLY USE MY SMARTPHONE
MOST OF THE TIME THE VEHICLE S ENTERTAINMENT APPS DON T WORK WITH THE DOWNLOADED ENTUNE APP ON MY MOBILE PHONE
PHONE CONNECTION IS ALWAYS BAD HARD TO TALK AND HEAR
VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY POOR SO CANNOT USE HANDS FREE
IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION COMMANDS
ITS JUST LIKE A CELL PHONE SOMETIMES YOU CAN HEAR GOOD SOMETIMES YOU CAN
I STILL HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO USE ANY OF THE APPS IN MY CAR BECAUSE IT KEEPS GIVING ME AN ERROR MESSAGE
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT GOOD
TIME NEEDS TO BE HIGHER AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I CAN T FIGURE OUT THE EQUALIZER FUNCTION ON THE AUDIO I DON T EVEN KNOW IF IT HAS ONE MAYBE I SHOULD LOOK IN THE OWNER S MANUAL
VOICE RECOGNITION GETTING NAMES PHONE NUMBERS SOME NAMES IT JUST DOESN T RECOGNIZE PLAN TO REORGANIZE NUMBERS I USE MOST REGULARLY SO CAN PULL BY NUMBER
NAVIGATION SHOULD USE GARMIN TECHNOLOGY UNABLE TO BRING UP OUTLINE OF DIRECTIONS SOMETIMES DIRECTIONS ARE VAGUE OR LATE STILL CAN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO END THE NAVIGATION ONCE IT HAS STARTED ONCE AM CLOSE TO HOME FOR EXAMPLE HAVE READ THE
WOULD LIKE MORE TACTILE CONTROLS AND LESS TOUCH SCREEN
IT MAY BE MORE OPERATOR ERROR THAN A PROBLEM WITH THE SYSTEM BUT I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO USE THE AHA APP WITH THE AUDIO SYSTEM I CONFESS I HAVEN T LEARNED HOW TO USE THE VOICE COMMANDS BUT IT S DIFFICULT TO CHANGE RADIO STATIONS WHEN PRESSING TH
SOMETIMES THE BLUETOOTH PHONE CALLS ARE INTERMITTENT
IN OUR LOCATION THE HD TRAFFIC DOESN T WORK DUE TO POPULATION OF OUR AREA NOT A USEFUL APP FOR ME AS A RESULT
I HAVE HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT THEY CANNON UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I PLACE THE CALL USING THE HANDS FREE PHONE IN THE VENZA I GET NO COMPLAINTS WHEN CALLING DIRECTLY FROM MY TELEPHONE
I M NOT SURE WHERE THE SPEAKER LOCATION IS FOR PHONE CALLS BUT I DRIVE ON THE INTERSTATE MOST OF THE TIME AND PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING ME TALK AND I FEEL LIKE I M YELLING I USUALLY JUST TURN OFF THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE DURING A CALL SO I AM
WHEN I HAVE MY IPOD PLUGGED IN AND GO TO MY PREFERRED PLAYLIST IF I WANT TO ADJUST SONGS THROUGH THE TOUCH SCREEN IT TAKES ME BACK TO THE MAIN MENU OF THE IPOD WHICH IS A WASTE OF TIME AND SOMETHING I DON T WANT TO DO WHILE DRIVING HOWEVER IT D
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION TACTILE FEED BACK SO STATIONS CAN BE CHANGED WITHOUT LOOKING AT UNIT TRAFFIC INFORMATION
DO AWAY WITH THE TOUCHSCREEN ALL OF THE MEDIA FEATURES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW THINGS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE HIDDEN BEHIND TOUCH CONTROLS FORCING YOU TO LOOK AWAY FROM THE ROAD TO DO ANYTHING ON TOP OF THAT THE TOUCH SCREEN ITSELF I
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS AWKWARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING MY EYES HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROAD TOO LONG I WISH I COULD CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE DISPLAY
TOUCHSCREEN FOR RADIO PRESELECTS MEANS I HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES OFF THE ROAD TO PICK A STATION HATE THAT
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DONE BY PASSENGER WHILE TRAVELING THE BOOKLETS INCLUDED TO INSTRUCT THE OWNER HOW TO USE ALL THESE SYSTEMS ARE TO COMPLEX
VERY CONFUSING TO SETUP RADIO STATIONS NO INSTRUCTIONS AT ALL IN MANUAL
THE SPEAKERS IN THIS CAR ARE REALLY LACKLUSTRE AND THE AUDIO TUNES IN AND OUT TO HD I TRULY HAVEN T USED THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AS I DO NOT OWN A CELL PHONE I DON T THINK ADDING A COUPLE OF HUNDRED DOLLARS TO MAKE THE CAR S AUDIO SOUND BETT
1 MAKE SOFT BUTTONS CHANGEABLE FOR EXAMPLE I WOULD PREFER THAT ONE BUTTON LEAD DIRECTLY TO AUDIO RATHER THAN APPS I RARELY USE APPS MOVING BACK TO AUDIO FROM PHONE TAKES MULTIPLE STEPS 2 VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAV DOESN T SEEM TO WORK
VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM NOT USER FRIENDLY TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS ARE LOCATED FOR TINY FINGERS AND I HAVE VERY SMALL HANDS THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS PRETTY USELESS
I FIND THE TOUCH SCREEN PROBLEMATIC WHEN DRIVING STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS AND AUDIO KNOBS ON DASH ARE EASIEST WHILE OPERATING VEHICLE
POINTS OF INTEREST HASN T WORKED SINCE I GOT THE CAR AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION ASPECTS ARE HORRIBLE
SOUND QUALITY IS PRETTY BAD I WISH I WENT WITH THE HARMON KARDON SYSTEM BLUETOOTH SPEED DIAL BUTTONS LOCATED ON RADIO SHOULD BE USABLE WHILE DRIVING AS THE RADIO IS
SOUND QUALITY NEED TO IMPROVE ALOT
SETTING UP THE PHONE BOOK IN THE VEHICLE IS RIDICULOUS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS SIRI THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM
MIRROR LINK DOES NOT WORK WOULD LOVE A NAV SYSTEM THAT USES MY PHONE S APPS INSTEAD OF MANUFACTURER NAV
CENTER DISPLAY ON DASH WHEN USING SATELLITE RADIO DOESN T FULLY DISPLAY ARTIST OR SONG
THE TWO MOST FRUSTRATING THINGS ABOUT MY CAR S AUDIO COMMUNICATION AND ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM ARE 1 THE LACK OF EFFECTIVE NOISE CANCELLATION SOFTWARE FOR HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS THIS PROHIBITS ME FROM BEING ABLE TO USE THE SYSTEM WHEN TRAVELING
VOICE COMMANDS NEED WORK
IN HD MODE SOUND IS JUST REALLY BAD QUALITY OF SPEAKER IS BARELY OK I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE UPGRADE
WHEN TALKING ON THE PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH CALLERS ON OTHER END OF THE LINE REPORT A LOT OF BACKGROUND NOISE TRY TO IMPROVE THE NOISE CANCELLING FEATURE OF THE BLUETOOTH MICROPHONE FOR VOICE CALLS
THE SOUND QUALITY IS THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THIS VEHICLE IF I WERE TO BUY IT AGAIN I WOULD PAY FOR THE UPGRADED STEREO SYSTEM
THE HEAD UNIT COULD HAVE BEEN OF BETTER QUALITY I THINK ITS JUST A VERY CHEAP STOCK HEAD UNIT ON THE BASE MODEL WRX BEING CHEAP THE SOUND QUALITY AND SIGNAL QUALITY IS POOR WHICH IS NO PROBLEM REALLY BECAUSE THEY RE EASILY REPLACEABLE WITH AFTE
BLUETOOTH PHONE CALLS ARE SO SO HEATING COOLING AND RADIO SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY TURN OFF WHEN PHONE CALL ENGAGES LIKE I HAVE EXPERIENCED IN OTHER CARS
SOUND SYSTEM LACK CLARITY POWER PUNCH SOUND QUALITY IS ON PAR TO SPEAKERS SUBMERGED IN WATER
THE UNIT TAKES FOREVER TO SCROLL THROUGH AN IPOD LOOKING FOR MUSIC
BLUETOOTH STREAMING AUDIO QUALITY IS NOT SO GOOD NOW
CONNECTING IPHONE CAN BE A PROBLEM RANDOMLY GET DISCONNECTED
CONNECTS WELL TO USB STORED MUSIC BLUETOOTH PHONE WORKS VERY WELL
USE GARMIN IN FOR NAV IN AUTOS
WHEN MY PHONE IS PLUGGED INTO THE VEHICLE S USB PORT IT REPEATEDLY ATTEMPTS TO INSTALL SOFTWARE INTO THE VEHICLE S SYSTEM AND MINIMALLY CHARGES
THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH CALLING QUALITY IS ATROCIOUS NO ONE CAN HEAR ME ALSO THE STOCK SOUND SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO VOICE YOU CANNOT HEAR CLEARWAY AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS WITH THE VOUME ON MAXIMUM
AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY BASIC NO WOW FACTOR
THE AUDIO ISN T OF GOOD QUALITY MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE WHICH WAS A 2003 HAD A MUCH BETTER AUDIO SYSTEM
IT IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE PHONE COMMUNICATIONS AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS THIS IS CAUSED BY THE ROAD NOISE WHILE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS
THE DISPLAY SCREEN NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE BIGGER AND NEEDS SHIELDING FROM OUTSIDE LIGHT ITS HARDER TO SEE DURING THE DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN USING REAR CAMERA
SPEAKERS CAN BE WEAK BUT I DID NOT OPTION FOR THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM ALSO I ACTUALLY LIKE THE BASIC LOOK OF THE RADIO HEAD UNIT
WEAK VOLUME EXCESSIVE HIGHS AT DEFAULT AND MINIMAL BASS TINNY SOUND QUALITY
THE USB PORT SHOULD FUNCTION BETTER AT TIMES THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY DOES NOT FUNCTION AUTOMATICALLY THERE IS A NEED TO MAKE SELECTIONS ON MY PHONE IF DESIRED
SETTINGS FOR SOUND QUALITY ARE NOT EFFICIENT TOO MANY MUSIC TYPE CHOICES WOULD PREFER ONE SETTING FOR AMOUNT OF BASS TREBLE ETC HATE SLIDING FUNCTION
THE BLUETOOTH WILL NOT CONNECT TO PANDORA OR GIVE ME STEP BY STEP NAVIGATION THROUGH THE SPEAKERS
THERE IS NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM COMMUNICATION WORKS WELL THE AUDIO CONNECTIVITY COULD BE MORE FLUID
I HATE TOUCH SCREEN
THEY NEED TO SORT OUT IPHONE INTEGRATION USB AND BT MODES ARE INCOMPATIBLE AND CONFUSE THE SYSTEM SUCH THAT NEITHER WILL WORK CORRECTLY WHEN I SAW THAT THE STOCK HEAD UNIT CAME WITH A USB PORT I WAS HOPING IT WOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC THROUG
NAVIGATION MAP UPDATES SHOULD NOT COST AN ARM OR A LEG ESPECIALLY MOST IF NOT ALL SMARTPHONE HAVE GPS AND FREE NAVIGATION APP SUCH AS GOOGLE MAP OR WAZE
THE IPOD INTERFACE ISN T VERY INTUITIVE IT S CUMBERSOME TO MOVE BETWEEN FOLDERS AND NOT SOMETHING I WOULD WANT TO DO WHEN DRIVING
FIX MENTIONED TOUCH SCREEN PROBLEMS JUST NEEDS REPROGRAMMING OF TOUCH SCEEN
AUDIO SYSTEM TAKES UP MAJORITY OF DASHBOARD SPACE CONTROLS FOR HEATING AND COOLING ARE TOO LOW AND IN SMALLER NUMBERS AND TOUCH PANELS TIME AND OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE DISPLAYS ARE TOO SMALL AND TOO LOW MORE FOCUS AND PRIORITY GIVEN TO AUDIO  COM
SPEAKER FOR VOICE RECOGNITION AND CALLS ARE TO FAR AWAY
VERY DIFFICULT TO USE THE ON SCREEN CONTROLS WHILE DRIVING
BETTER RECOGNITION OF VOICE COMMANDS
I STILL USE MY IPAD FOR DESTINATIONS SINCE THE ON BOARD SYSTEM IS CUMBERSOME AND SOMEWHAT INACCURATE THE SCREEN IS SMALL AND I HAVE FOUND SOME ADDRESSES TO BE UNAVAILABLE AS NOT ALL LETTERS AND NUMBERS APPEAR WHEN TYPING THEM IN I USE THE NAVI
I DO NOT LIKE THAT I CANNOT DIAL ON THE TOUCH SCREEN WHEN THE VEHICLE IS MOVING WHEN I TRY TO USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IT ALWAYS IS INCORRECT AND I AM FORCED TO PICK UP MY PHONE AND DIAL IT MANUALLY THE DIAL PAD ON THE TOUCH SCREEN SHOULD ALWAY
SIMPLIFY THE NAV SYSTEM
NAVIGATION AND THE ABILITY TO PROGRAM WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING
MICROPHONE
AUDIO IS TERRIBLE NAVIGATION IS EASIER ON IPHONE THAN ON TOYOTA SYSTEM
NEED TO HAVE SYSTEM IDENTIFY PARKS CHURCHES ETC WITHOUT SPECIFIC ADDRESSES
BLUETOOTH TO PHONE SEEMS QUIRKY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS GOOD SOUND QUALITY POOR
LOVE THE BLUETOOTH AND AUDIO NOT HAPPY WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT USER FRIENDLY
VOICE CONTROLS MISUNDERSTAND SO OFTEN THAT I DON T USE THEM AT ALL
PHONE VOICE RECOGNITION
POOR SOUND QUALITY FROM FACTORY SPEAKERS
MORE ACCURATE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
SHOULD BE ABLE TO FREE TEXT BY SPEAKING OR HANDS FREE AND SEND IT
AS STATED EARLIER THE MAP COULD BE BETTER AS WELL AS THE SOUND
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL USUALLY CONFUSES WHAT I M SAYING
I M USED TO PHYSICAL BUTTONS AND KNOBS WHEN USING A CAR RADIO THIS IS THE FIRST CAR I HAVE OWNED WITH A TOUCHSCREEN THOUGH THE TOUCHSCREEN ALLOWS MORE FLEXIBILITY I JUST DON T LIKE THE FACT THAT IF I WANT TO CHANGE STATIONS OR AUDIO SETTINGS
WHILE PLAYING MUSIC ON SATELLITE MUSIC THERE NEEDS TO BE AWAY FOR THE NAME OF THE SONG AND ARTIST TO SHOW UP ON THE SCREE
THE STEERING CONTROLS WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU COULD SCROLL THROUGH YOUR PRESETS WITH SATELLITE RADIO
BETTER QUALITY SPEAKERS WOULD HELP THE EXPERIENCE SOUND QUALITY IS A LITTLE TINNY
AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE NOT ADEQUATE OR DON T FEEL NATURAL THE AUDIO SYSTEM HAS A LITTLE DELAY AND I DON T LIKE THE FADE FEATURE WHEN FFD OF SONGS
HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO ATTACH MY IPOD
I LOOKED FORWARD TO CONNECTING MY CELL PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH FOR CELL SERVICE IN THE CAR IT DOES NOT SUPPORT MY PHONE A BROADER SELECTION OF SUPPORTED PHONES WOULD BE GREAT
THE NAVIGATION SUCKS I EXPLAINED WHY IN THE THINGS GONE WRONG
SYSTEM WORKS WELL BUT IS LOW RESOLUTION SMALL AND LACKS CONNECTIVITY USB
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO CHANGE STATIONS IS DIFFICULT
MAKE IT EASIER TO LOAD CD S
WHEN I AM IN PARK AND PUT IT IN DRIVE MY RADIO VOLUME TURNS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY IS NOT VERY EASY TO USE I THINK THE CALIBRATION IS OFF
ABILITY TO CONTROL WITH A KNOB NEAR THE SHIFTER HAVING TO REACH TO THE TOUCHSCREEN IS DIFFICULT WHILE DRIVING AND ALSO DANGEROUS
PLEASE INCLUDE STANDARD USB ON CARS NOT PROPRIETARY CONNECTORS FOR DEVICES TO BE HARD WIRED TO MY MDI CABLE THAT CAME WITH MY CAR DID NOT WORK AND I STILL DO NOT HAVE A NEW ONE FROM THE DEALER
THE DEFAULT VOLUME FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TOO LOW
CAN NOT SWITCH FROM FM TO SATELLITE VIA STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS HAVE TO USE RADIO CONTROLS RADIO SCREEN STAYS IN PHONE MODE AFTER CALL IS COMPLETE CAN NOT SCAN SATELLITE CHANNELS WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL ONLY LISTEN TO PRESETS WHEN PLACING
THE RESPONSE TIME OF THE CONTROLS ARE A LITTLE SLOW IN REACTING FOR EXAMPLE WHEN ADJUSTING VOLUME THERE IS A DELAY IN RESPONSE THE NAVAGATION NEEDS SOME WORK IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE ADDRESS TO BE DISPLAYED WHEN NEARING YOUR DESTINATION ESPE
NOT HAVING A USB PORT OR AT LEAST PROVIDING THE USB VERSION OF THE MDI CORD IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE ON ALL LEVELS IN TODAY S MARKET
I M TOO OLD SCHOOL RADIO CD TO RATE OF USE MOST OF THE GADGETS ON THE CAR
STILL LEARNING THE CONTROLS FOR AN IPOD CHOOSING GENRES OR PLAYLIST IS STILL A LEARNING PROCESS FOR ME
VW S VERSION OF THE USB PORT IS POSITIONED AWKWARDLY IN THE SPACE THAT USED TO BE THE ASTRAY AND IT SHOULD BE A REGULAR USB INSTEAD OF THE PROPRIETARY CONNECTION
I DON T LIKE THE NEED TO SWIPE SCREENS TO ACCESS STORED RADIO STATIONS I ALSO THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE RADIO STATION PRESETS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ABYSMAL REALLY THIS IS MY WIFE USES IT BUT I ALWAYS PREFER GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE YOU NEED TO INTEGRATE WITH GOOGLE GET OFF THE PROPRIETARY NAV SYSTEM AND ALSO GET ANDROID INTEGRATION AS OPPOSED TO APPLE DEPEN
VOICE RECOGNITION AND NAVIGATION NAVIGATION FEELS ABOUT 6 YEARS BEHIND IN DISPLAY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
OTHERS CANNOT HEAR ME WELL ON BLUETOOTH CALLS THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS TOO CONFUSION AND I RARELY USE IT AS A RESULT
NEEDS USB   AUX PORTS
THE USB CABLE IS TOO SHORT IT S PROBABLY OPERATOR ERROR ME BUT I CAN T SEEM TO USE THE BLUETOOTH WITH MY SIRI FUNCTION OF MY CELL PHONE I NEED A LESSON FROM ONE OF MY KIDS
ATTRACTIVENESS OF INTERFACE WHEN USING BLUETOOTH PHONE
MORE CONSISTENT CONNECTION WITH AUX IPOD HARD WIRED ONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS GREAT
SOMETIMES THE SYSTEM IS BALKY WHEN I TRY TO CONNECT MY IPOD
ROAD NOISE IS TOO GREAT DURING PHONE CALLS
MY PRIOR CAR CHEVY CRUZ HAD A MUCH BETTER FEEL AND COLOR SCHEME THE BLUETOOTH AND CONNECTING WAS MUCH BETTER I PREFER THE TIGUAN ALL AROUND BUT THE AUDIO SYSTEM AND TOUCH SCREEN SEEMS A LITTLE BEHIND THE TIMES
VOICE ACTIVATED CALLING
LARGER SCREEN FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE AND IT SHOULD BE CLEAR ON HOW TO RETRIEVE AND COMPOSE TEXT MESSAGES
SATELLITE RADIO
NAVIGATION SEARCHES NEED TO WORK MORE LIKE A SMART PHONE WHERE I SPEAK A POINT OF INTEREST IT IS FOUNDS AND QUICKLY MAPPED THIS NAV SYSTEM DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE THAT FUNCTION TO SEARCH FOR A PLACE LIKE THAT I HAVE TO WAIT A LONG TIME FOR THE IN
THE HD RADIO DOES NOT ALWAYS CONNECT IT IS KIND OF ANNOYING WHEN THE HD DOES NOT CONNECT BECAUSE IT STUTTERS THE MUSIC WHEN IT IS TRYING TO CONNECT
NAVIGATION POIS READING OF USB MUSIC
NEED TO SPEED UP THE ONBOARD APPLICATIONS AND THE INTERNET CONNECTION HAS TO HAVE 4G COMPATIBILITY IN ORDER TO BE WORTH IT ALSO THE MOBILE APP NEEDS TO BE FASTER AND MORE RELIABLE HAVE PROBLEMS CONNECTING TO REMOTE START AND LOCK THE CAR
THE FRONT CENTER DISPLAY FOR SIRIUS IS HORRIBLE IT LOOKS LIKE A DESIGN FROM THE PAST I DISLIKE THE SCREEN COLORS AND THE NAVIGATION TO GO THROUGH IT COULD DEFINITELY BE IMPROVED ALSO THE CAMERA BACK MIRROR IN THE DISPLAY IS NOT VERY HELPFUL
RESPONSE SPEED OF RADIO NAVIGATION UNIT TO INPUTS
SOMETIMES WHEN I M TALKING ON MY HANDS FREE IPHONE THROUGH MY CAR THE CALLER CAN T HEAR ME CLEARLY
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO ENTER AN ADDRESS TO SEARCH
SPEED OF PUTTING IN A NEW DESTINATION
POINT OF INTEREST SPEECH FINDER NAVIGATION FEATURE
AS MENTIONED THE USB LOCATION AND AMOUNTS OF
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE TOUCH SCREEN CAPABILITY INSTEAD OF TURNING WHEEL FOR SOME ENTRIES USE VOICE BUT SO FAR WOULD PREFER A TOUCH SCREEN TO MAKE CHANGES ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN AND A LOGIC BEHIND IT THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE CURRENTLY IN USE
VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE MAKES FAR TOO MANY MISTAKES
THE SCROLL WHEEL TO ENTER INFORMATION INTO THE NAV SYSTEM IS CLUNKY AND SHOULD BE IMPROVED OR ABANDONED IN FAVOR OF TOUCH SCREEN OR SOMETHING ELSE
VOICE CONTROL OF NAVIGATION PLUS EQUIVALENT OF LEXUS ENFORM
NAVIGATION SCREEN SIZE IMPROVED CONTROLS AND BETTER REAL TIME TRAFFIC
THE EASE OF USING THE NAVIGATION CONTROLS
THE SOUND OF THE PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH IS AWFUL THE CARS BUILT IN BLUETOOTH SYSTEM DISCONNECTS AND RECONNECTS WITHOUT WARNING THE CARS BLUETOOTH DOES NOT UTILIZE THE VARIOUS CONTROLS BUILT IN ON MY ANDROID SMARTPHONE SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 THE WIFI H
NAV SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE SIMPLIFIED EVEN MORE
THE SYSTEM OF DIALING IN THE DESTINATION IS NOT VERY GOOD BUT IT MAY BE A MATTER OF JUST GETTING USED TO IT
NAVIGATION IS HARD TO USE IT USES A THUMB WHEEL TO NEGOTIATE THE MENU AND STREET SPELLINGS SEEMS TO NEED ENTIRE DESTINATION ADDRESS BEFORE IT WILL WORK I FREQUENTLY USE MY CELLPHONE FOR NAVIGATION AS IT ASSISTS IN LOCATING DESTINATIONS
BETTER INTEGRATION WITH IPHONE SIRI EYES FREE OR CARPLAY
I WAS EXPECTING A SLIGHTLY MORE DYNAMIC AUDIO SYSTEM I E 9 12 MIXTURE OF SPEAKERS AND A SUBWOOFER AS FOUND IN MY 2004 VOLVO S80 T6 I ALSO THINK THE THAT AT LEAST 2 3 SPEAKERS SHOULD BE PLACED IN EMPTY SPACE ABOVE BEHIND RED SEATS AGAIN AS I
NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND VOICE COMMANDS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT DO NOT WORK
WHEN USING SIRI ON MY IPHONE THERE IS A DELAY THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH AND I M NOT ABLE TO USE IT WHILE IN THE CAR
NAV SYSTEM S REAL TIME TRAFFIC LIKES TO SEND ME A POP UP ADVISING ME THAT TRAFFIC CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED AND SUGGESTING AN ALTERNATE ROUTE WHICH IS USUALLY LONGER MOST OF THE TIME I DECLINE AND NEVER SEE ANY EVIDENCE OF ISSUES AS I DRIVE THROU
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE OPTIONAL IT IS OBSOLETE NOW THAT NAVIGATION CAN BE DONE FROM PHONE AND ADDS UNNECESSARY COST TO CAR
I MUCH PREFER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OF MY PREVIOUS CAR TOYOTA THE TOUCH SCREEN WAS EASIER TO USE FOR BOTH PHONE CALLS AND NAVIGATION AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE NUMBER OF STEPS TO MAKE A PHONE CALL ARE WAY TOO MANY IT SHOULD TAKE ONE OR TWO S
I FIND IT EASIER TO USE MY I PHONE FOR NAVIGATION THAN THE ONE IN THE CAR HOWEVER IT IS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT OVER THE S60 I PREVIOUSLY OWNED
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT IT SIMPLY CAN T COMPREHEND SIMPLE WORDS THAT I USE OFTEN WHEN TRYING TO MAKE HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS SUE AND MOM MY SECONDARY FRUSTRATION IS THE USE OF THE SIRIUS IT S SIMPLE TO GET TO SIR
NON VOICE ACTIVATED CONTROLS ARE TRICKY NAVIGATION OFTEN TRIES TO PUT YOU ON STRANGE ROUTES THE LOCAL ROAD THAT PARALLELS THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY RATHER THAN THE INTERSTATE HIGHWAY THIS CAN BE ANNOYING
WELL THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS PRETTY POOR THE OTHER IS THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WILL BE OUT OF DATE IN A FEW YEARS SO YOU HAVE A CAR WITH A DAMAGED RESALE VALUE THE GIMIC FEATURES ARE SIMPLY NOT WORTH IT NONE OF THEM ADD MUCH SIRIUS IS PROB
EASE OF INPUT TO NAVIGATION
NO TOUCHSCREEN NAVIGATION
I CAN T GET MY TABLET TO CONNECT TO THE INTERNET THROUGH THE INSTALLED SYSTEM
WHEN DRIVING HARD TO FIND THE CHANNEL YOU WANT ON SIRIUS RADIO AND SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN RADIO CD MEDIA SETTING WHILE WATCHING THE ROAD
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE THE SPEECH RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE THE TRAFFIC NEEDS TO HAVE ALL ROADS AND THE APPS ARE SO SLOW THEY RE USELESS IT TAKES FOREVER TO LOAD APPS AND WHY DID YOU GO WITH 3G AND NOT 4G OR LTE BASICALLY 3G IS LIKE
I NEED AN AFTER MARKET CABLE TO CONNECT USB DEVICE CD PLAYER IS IN THE GLOVE BOX AUDIO CONTROLS OTHER THAN VOLUME CHANGING STATIONS REQUIRE TAKING YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD
COMPARE THE NAV AND THE APPS TO THOSE IN IOS AND YOU WILL KNOW WHY THEY ARE SO BAD

BLUETOOTH PLAYING OF AUDIO FROM A PHONE SPECIFICALLY WITH AN AUDIOBOOK SOMETIMES IT S HARD TO KNOW IF IT S PLAYING AND I CAN T HEAR IT OR IF IT S STOPPED OR PAUSED OR WAITING ON ME TO HIT PLAY ON THE PHONE SOMETIMES I GET IN THE CAR AND IT
INCREASED SPEED IN PROCESSING VOICE COMMANDS
THE NAVIGATION ALPHABET WHEEL ENTRY IS TERRIBLE AND VOICE RECOGNITION IS ONLY GOOD FOR TELLING IT TO GO TO A PREVIOUS DESTINATION
DUMP THE VOLVO SYSTEM AND IMPLEMENT APPLE CARPLAY VOICE RECOGNITION IN THE VOLVO SYSTEMS IS FLAT OUT BAD
I D LOVE FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO MEMORIZE MY PREFERRED ROUTES TO PLACES THAT I DON T GO TO VERY OFTEN IF I ONLY GO SOMEPLACE EVERY 6 MONTHS OR SO I M NOT GOING TO REMEMBER THE ROUTE BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE NAV SYSTEM WOULD RECOGNIZE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND COMPARED TO MY OLD TOM TOM
I WISH THE RADIO CONTROLS WERE CONSTANTLY AVAILABLE EVEN WHEN I M NOT IN RADIO MODE ALSO SWITCHING FROM AM TO FM RADIO IS INCONVENIENT TAKING THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT GESTURES
THE NAVIGATION WOULD BENEFIT BY DEFAULTING TO THE CITY YOU ARE IN OR LIVE IN WHEN LOOKING FOR DESTINATIONS ITS SOMETIMES NOT WORTH THE EFFORT TO HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH FOR CITY AS WELL AS OTHER ADDRESS COMPONENTS
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION LOST ON A REGULAR BASIS THE AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE AN INTERNAL HARD DRIVE THAT CAN STORE CD S AND PLAY THEM BACK THROUGH A JUKEBOX I FIND THE MEDIA OTHER THAN RADIOS FRUSTRATING OVERALL TO USE AND LISTEN TO
NAVIGATION EASIER TO FIND POINTS OF INTEREST IN A LARGER AREA THAN YOUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS
CONTROL OF BLUETOOTH CONNECTED DEVICE THROUGH AUDIO SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE
THE VEHICLE NEEDS MORE USB PORTS INSTEAD OF THREE 12V PORTS *A 110 115 120 V OUTLET IN THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE WOULD BE NICE TOO THE ROCKFORD FOSGATE SOUND SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING FOR A STOCK SYTEM BUT THE NAV COULD BE MUCH MORE ACCURATE WITH D
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER
SCROLLING THROUGH ALL THE SATELLITE CHANNELS TAKES A LOT OF TIME YOU CAN PROGRAM 10 STATIONS INTO THE RADIO PRESENT STATION BUTTONS BUT IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU COULD JUMP FROM A FULL SCREEN TO THE NEXT FULL SCREEN RATHER THAN GOING ONE BY ONE
VOICE RECOGNITION IS DIFFICULT TO USE CAN T USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO SET DESTINATION WHILE DRIVING

THE TOUCH PAD MOUSE IS SOMETIMES TOO SENSITIVE I HAVE A POWER CORD PLUGGED INTO THE AUX POWER PORT IN THE CENTER CONSOLE AND THAT CORD WILL OFTEN ACTIVATE THE TOUCH PAD
THE NEW LEXUS MODELS USE A TOUCH PAD TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE AUDIO MEDIA NAVIGATION COMMANDS WITH NO TOUCH SCREEN OPTION DUE TO THE SENITIVITY IT IS VERY DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS TO USE WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON MAKING S
I FIND IT TEDIOUS TO ENTER AN ADDRESS SO ALWAYS USE MY IPHONE INSTEAD
CELL PHONE SOUND AND RECEPTION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MADE MORE INTUITIVE OTHER CARS MERCEDES NAVIGATION SYSTEMS ARE BETTER

I FIND THE NAVIGATION IN PARTICULAR TO BE HARDER TO USE THAN IT HAS TO BE

NORMALIZATION OF VOLUME CONTROLS ACROSS MEDIA TYPES SWITCHING FROM BT AUX TO RADIO RESULTS IS LOUND BLAST OF SOUND THAT IS VERY ANNOYING AND POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS IN HOW IT JOLTS YOU
HANDS FREE FEATURE IS AWKWARD
IT IS CLUMSY TO NAVIGATE THROUGH MUSIC ON AN IPOD
A PORSCHE CAN BE DRIVEN QUICKLY THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP UP TO TURNS IN NAVIGATION I HAVE MISSED TURNS BECAUSE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DID NOT WARN ME OF A TURN SOON ENOUGH
NAVIGATION AND MAP DESIGN IN PARTICULAR SEE EARLIER NOTES A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT
VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE WORKS BETTER IN MY MB E63
I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM I HAD BEEN SPOILED WITH MY PRIOR 2003 ACURA TLS THAT HAD A BOSE SOUND SYSTEM IT S ALMOST LIKE THEY WENT OUT OF THE WAY TO MAKE THIS ONE INFERIOR TO THAT SO PEOPLE WOULD FEEL PRESSU
ABILITY TO STORE ITUNES MUSIC LIBRARY ON THE HARD DRIVE
BOSE IS NOT A HIGH END BRAND AND YOU SHOULDN T BE CHARGING $1 000 000 FOR THE BURMEISTER BOSE SHOULD BE THE STANDARD SYSTEM AND BURMEISTER SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR HALF ITS CURRENT PRICE THE SOUND OF THE SPEAKERS IS VERY POOR PLEASE BUY A LEXU
POI SELECTION ON NAV SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO OPERATE
INTERFACE SEEMS RATHER ANTIQUATED ALSO IF YOU HAVE TWO BLUETOOTH ENABLED PHONES IN THE CAR THE SYSTEM GETS CONFUSED
BETTER SOUND QUALITY IN SPEAKERS
NAV IS SUBSTANDARD REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS THE WORST I HAVE SEEN
THERE ARE NO NAVIGATION SYSTEMS THE AUDIO IS EXCELLENT EXCEPT WHEN THE SUNROOF IS OPEN WIND NOISE KILLS EVERYTHING IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT HAD A NAVIGATION SYSTEM STANDARD
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T WORK PROPERLY
AUTO CONNECTIVITY ON BLUETOOTH COULD BE IMPROVED AS STATED EARLIER THE JETTA AUTO SYNC S 90% OF THE TIME BEETLE NEEDS TO BE COAXED INTO SYNCHING EITHER DUE TO PHONE OR CAR NOT SURE WHICH ONE NOT A DEAL BREAKER LOVE THE CAR
I FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OFTEN SENDS ME ON VERY ROUNDABOUT ROUTES AND IS NEVER UPDATED WITH REAL TIME INFORMATION FOR EXAMPLE IT ADDED 30 MINUTES TO MY TRIP THE OTHER DAY BY TRYING TO TAKE ME ON A ROAD THAT IS CLOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION I LAT
NAV INTERFACE IS SIGNIFICANTLY LAGGING BEHIND OTHER MANUFACTURERS TECHNOLOGY
WHEN I TRY TO DIAL THE PHONE USING MY VOICE THE LADY NEVER GETS THE NAME CORRECT MORE FRUSTRATING THAN TO JUST NAVIGATE TO THE NUMBER I NEED USING THE SCREEN
WHEN YOU HAVE SO MUCH ELECTRONIC COMPUTER STUFF ON A CAR I THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE DVD S FOR ALL THE FEATURES IT IS VERY HARD TO LOOK AT A BOOK AND THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE EVERYTHING OPERATE I AM A VISUAL PERSON AND L
I THINK THE BLUETOOTH QUALITY IS AVERAGE THE CALLS ARE ALWAYS MUFFLED A BIT HARD TO UNDERSTAND ETC AT THAT POINT I DON T EVEN BOTHER WITH THE VOICE COMMANDS BECAUSE THE BLUETOOTH TALKING ON THE PHONE IS HARD ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THE OTHER PER
PHONE CALL SOUND NEEDS IMPROVEMENT USUALLY CHANGE TO IPHONE AUDIO
TOO MANY COMMANDS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A PHONE CALL WITH VOICE COMMAND
I DON T HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM I DON T REALLY HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
THE AUDIO NEEDS SOME OOMPH THE DAYS OF THE MONSOON STEREO SYSTEMS WERE GREAT ESPECIALLY IF THERE WAS A SMALL STOCK 8 SUBWOOFER SOMEWHERE IN THERE THE TRUNK IN THIS CAR IS HUGE I M SURPRISED THERE ISN T AN AMPLIFIER AND SMALL SUB THROWN IN T
THE DISPLAY IS A BIT ARCHAIC TO THAT OF A SMARTPHONE APP E G GOOGLE MAPS
GOOGLE MAPS WOULD BE BETTER
NAVIGATION SCREEN IS TO SMALL
VOICE RECOGNITION AND SOUND QUALITY WHEN USING PHONE
SOME CONTROLS FROM AN IPHONE ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO CHOOSE FROM SO IT S TRULY NOT A WIRELESS WAY TO LISTEN TO MUSIC
SPEAKERS NEED TO BE A HIGHER QUALITY AND INTEGRATED EQUALIZER WOULD HELP WITH THE PERFORMING OF THE AUDIO
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SOMETIMES DOESN T UNDERSTAND WHAT I M SAYING WHICH CAN BE FRUSTRATING
NAVIGATION WITH TRAFFIC
THE LAYOUT OF THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
OVERALL AUDIO PERFORMANCE AND SPEAKERS SOUND QUALITY IS DISAPPOINTING
BIGGEST OPPORTUNITY IS TO IMPROVE THE SOUND QUALITY WHEN USING THE PHONE THROUGH BLUETOOTH
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO PUT IN CERTAIN ADDRESSES SOMETIMES
SIZE OF THE NAVIGATION SCREEN MORE COLORFUL DIFFERENT VIEWING OPTIONS VERBAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF UPCOMING EXITS WITH PICTURE
INSTEAD OF VW SPECIFIC INPUT CABLE USE STANDARD USB INPUT
MORE RELIABLE HARDWIRED CONNECTION TO MEDIA IPOD
THE CAR SHOULD HAVE A USB PORT
I HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS CONNECTING MY ANDROID PHONE WHEN USING IT TO PLAY MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH
FM STATION LOCKING OFTENTIMES THE RADIO DROPS THE STATION ON WHICH IT IS TYPICALLY SET FORCING A REDO
BOUGHT THE CAR MAINLY FOR THE SIZE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I AM WORKING IN A CITY THAT HAS VERY BAD AREAS NOT HAVING A NAVIGATION IS VERY SERIOUS AND DANGEROUS
I M NOT A BIG MUSIC OR TECHNOLOGY PERSON I M SURE THIS SYSTEM IS FAR MORE ADVANCED THAN I AM
I WISH IT WAS EASIER TO USE HANDS FREE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE VERY DIFFICULT TO ENTER DESTINATIONS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS A BETTER MAP AND OPTIONS ITS HARD TO TELL WHEN THE TURN IS COMING UP AND HOW LONG BEFORE WE HAVE TO TURN THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS NOT BAD AT ALL BUT BLUETOOTH PHONE HAS POOR QUALITY AND PEOPLE HEAR ECHOS
THE NAVIGATION SUCKS IT FEELS LIKE THE CAR IS OLDER THAN THE DIRECTIONS ARE NOT VERY CLEAR IT DOESNT SHOW YOU MUTIPLE WAYS TO GET TO YOUR DESTINATION THE TIME DOESNT THINK OF TRAFFIC YOU CANT MOVE THE MAP AROUND AND LOOK FOR POI IN THE MAP
I HAVE SOME DIFFICULTLY GETTING THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO RECOGNIZE WHAT I AM SAYING
IF VOICE RECOGNITION UNDERSTOOD WHAT I AM SAYING IT WOULD HAVE THE HIGHEST MARKS
RADIO SOUND IS GREAT NAV IS TOUGH TO USE AS I JUST MENTIONED BEFORE ON THE RARE OCCASION THAT I DO NOT KNOW WHERE I AM GOING I USE MY IPHONE THIS IS SUCH A MINOR PART OF THE CAR NAVIGATION WHY SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT IT J D
INCOMING VOICE QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED THE SOUND IS NOT REAL CLEAR
LIKE ALL OTHERS WE HAVE TRIED BLUETOOTH ISN T RELIABLE
A HEARING PROBLEM PREVENTS MY FROM HEARING THE PROMPT FORM THE AUTOMATED FEATURE THE TONE OF THE BEEP IS OUT OF MY RANGE OF HEARING A LIGHT ON THE DASH WITH THE BEEP WOULD REMEDY THIS PROBLEM IT IS A LOT OF TROUBLE TO INPUT ADDRESSES INTO
BOSE SPEAKERS WEREN T OFFERED ON THE MODEL OF REGAL I PURCHASED THIS WAS A HUGE TURNOFF AND I M NOT HAPPY THAT I LL NEED TO HAVE CUSTOM SYSTEMS ADDED TO THE VEHICLE AFTERMARKET
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY I HAVE YET TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SAVE A DESTINATION OR PROGRAM HOME EVERY TIME YOU PROGRAM A LOCATION IT KEEPS IT AND I CAN NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO DELETE MULTIPLES OF THE SAME ADDRESS
CADILLAC NAV SYSTEM IS NOT NECESSARILY USER FRIENDLY THE TOYOTA PRIUS NAV SYSTEM IS THE CADILLAC HAS NO ALTERNATE ROUTES FROM WHICH TO SELECT IE SHORTEST FASTEST NORMAL THE SYSTEM REQUIRES MULTIPLE STEPS TO CANCEL ROUTE GUIDANCE RATER
NAVIGATION NOT ACCURATE
USING VOICE COMMAND TO MAKE A CALL IS CUMBERSOME SLOW READ PREVIOUS COMMENT MY 13 JEEP IS EXCELLENT DEPENDABLE
VOICE RECOGNITION OF NAV AND THE WAY IT DOES POIS
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS TO NOT UNDERSTAND YES OR NO AS A RESPONSE TO A QUESTION SUCH AS CALL SO AND SO HOME
DUMP THE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS AND GO BACK TO SIMPLE BUTTONS AND KNOBS
VOICE AND NAVIGATION
OVERALL THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD THE MOST PROBLEMS I HAVE IS WITH NAVIGATION USING THE VOICE ASSISTED PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY CHALLENGING
REAR SEAT DVD CONTROL FROM FRONT WOULD MAKE IT EASIER HAVE TO USE THE REMOTE AND THE KIDS ARE NOT OF AGE TO DO THIS YET
BOSE STEREO IS GREAT
VOICE COMMANDS ARE SLOW
CUE ON SCREEN IS GENERALLKY DIFFICULT TO USE I AM NOT VERY COMPUTER SAVVY AND IT SEEMS COMPLICATED TO GAIN FULL USE OF THE MANY FEATURES IT OFFERS
I DO NOT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS
BETTER CONTROL OF CUE SYSTEM
OUR VEHICLE INCLUDES A CHARGING PAD BUT IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MOST PHONES THEREFORE WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE IT ALSO I HAVE NOT SPENT ENOUGH TIME TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE VOICE CONTROL FEATURES PLEASE ALSO SEE MY PRIOR COMMENTS REGARDING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT EXTREMELY INTUITIVE SINCE IT S NOT USED FREQUENTLY IT TAKES ME A WHILE TO REMEMBER HOW TO USE ALL THE FEATURES
PROVIDE FOR ROUTE GUIDANCE OPTIONS SUCH AS MAXIMIZE MINIMIZE FREEWAYS AVOID TOLL ROADS FASTEST ROUTE DIRECT ROUTE
NAV SYSTEM IS SLUGGISH ALSO BLUETOOTH FEATURE DOESN T WORK WELL WITH ALL IPHONE APPS
THE JEEP CHEROKEE HAS BETTER GPS TECHNOLOGY PUTTING A ENTIRE ADDRESS IN ONE LINE IS A MAJOR DRAW BACK AS OPPOSED TO CITY NUMBER AND STREET ON SEPARATE LINES THAT RECOGNIZE PARTIAL INPUT AND GIVE YOU QUICK REFERENCES COULD NOT BELIEVE HAD T
VOICE COMMANDS ARE DIFFICULT TO REMEMBER THOUGH VOICE RECOGNITION HAS BEEN IMPROVED IT IS FAR FROM PERFECT
CADILLAC S CUE SYSTEM NEEDS VOLUME AND SEEK KNOBS LIKE MY OLD ESCALADE HAD I MISS THE KNOBS FROM MY OLD ESCALADE CADILLAC S CUE SYSTEM IS SLOW AND HARD TO USE WHY DID GM CHANGE TO CUE IT IS A TERRIBLE SYSTEM
WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO BE EASIER TO PLAY MOVIES FROM IPHONE IPAD ITOUCH OR FLASH DRIVE ON THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM
TOUCH SCREEN SEEMS VERY TOUCHY SOMETIMES ACTIVATED VERY QUICKLY OTHER TIMES HAVE TO PRESS MULTIPLE TIMES
ONE OF THE BEST UX WITH SOME HICKUPS IN NAVIGATION SEARCH
AUDIO IS OS FOR PHONE RECOGNITION SEEMS TO HAVE PROBLEM ON NAVIGATION
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS CUMBERSOME TO USE IF ALL VEHICLE VOICE SYSTEMS WORKED LIKE APPLE S SIRI EVERYONE WOULD LIKE THEM BETTER ALSO THE CLOCK DISPLAY IS TOOOOOOOOO SMALL I ALMOST NEED READING GLASSES TO SEE IT
VOICE CONTROL IS TOO SLOW
HAD A DVD PLAYER INSTALLED BY THE DEALERSHIP AND IT UNFORTUNATLEY OVERRIDES MOST OF THE AUDIO FEATURES THE SUBURBAN HAS WOULD HAVE LOVED A FACTORY DVD INSTALLED BUT THE DEALERSHIP SAID THAT THE SURBURBANS WERE NOT SETUP TO ADD FACTORY DVD PLAYE
THE AIR SOUND TO OTHERS WHEN USING THE SPEAKER PHONE THE SLOWNESS OF THE RADIO SCION CHANGING WHEN IN HD MODE THE LACK OF TITLE ON SONGS PLAYED ON FM OR AM RADIO
IT S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD EXCEPT THAT IF SOMEONE ELSE RIDES WITH ME AND WANTS TO PLAY MUSIC FROM THEIR DEVICE IT DOESN T SEEM TO WORK AS EASILY THEY CAN T HOOK UP TO THE BLUETOOTH I AM OVERALL HAPPY WITH IT THOUGH EXCEPT THAT MY SPEAKERS START
BETTER STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
EASE OF ENTERING INFO INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
FIX THE IPOD ISSUE I WAS TOLD I HAD INTERNET CAPABILITY ON DELIVERY BUT I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT IS NOT AVAILABLE
POINTS OF INTEREST IN NAV SYSTEM ARE LIMITED HUGE IMPROVEMENT OVER MY SUBURBAN BUT I STILL RARELY FIND THE POINTS OF INTEREST I NEED I WOULDN T CONSIDER THOSE I SEARCH FOR AS OBSCURE
BMW PHONE SYSTEM IS MUCH BETTER
IMPROVED VOICE RECOGNITION
THE GPS SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED THE LOCATION OF THE HOUSE SEARCHED FOR IS ABOUT 100 YDS PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL ONE MY LAST GARMAN WAS RIGHT ON WITH SUCH A LOCATION
NO USB CONNECTIVITY IN VEHICLE
I DONT USE NAVIGATION BECAUSE I DONT LIKE TO CALL ONSTAR FOR DRIVING DIRECTIONS BUT I HAVE USED THE MAP AND IT IS EASY TO READ WHEN DRIVING
THE SYSTEM MAKES EXTENSIVE USE OF TOUCH SCREEN AND FLUSH PRESSURE ACTIVATED BUTTONS BOTH ARE HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING A GOOD ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE CONVENTIONAL BUTTONS THAT YOU CAN FEEL WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK DOWN
NEVER HAD A NAVIGATION IN MY PREVIOUS CAR REALLY NICE FEATURE LOVE THE SELECTION OF RADIO STATIONS AS WELL
DIFFICULT TO LEARN VOICE CONTROLS
I DON T LIKE THAT WHEN I PLUG MY PHONE IN TO CHARGE IT AUTOMATICALLY STARTS PLAYING TRACKS FROM MY PHONE I WANT TO STILL LISTEN TO THE RADIO I JUST WANT MY PHONE TO CHARGE THROUGH THE USB
CANT USE THE CDS THAT IM ACCOUSTOMED TO USING
DO NOT LIKE THAT THE ONLY PLACE TO PLUG IN MY SMARTPHONE TO USE THE AUX IS THROUGH THE CENTER CONSOLE
ONLY SEEM TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT PANDORA VIS USB PLUG IN FROM IPAD
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CD PLAYER
BLUETOOTH GIVES PROBLEMS SOMETIMES SOMETIMES IT GETS CONFUSED BETWEEN THE USB AND BLUETOOTH TOO MANY BUTTONS WHEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS FOR BLUETOOTH
I M UNABLE TO CONNECT TO PANDORA WIRELESSLY I WOULD LIKE TO NOT HAVE TO HOOK MY PHONE TO THE SUB TO USE IT MY VEHICLE TEXT FEATURE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE WORKING
POOR BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
I DONT THINK THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND IT IS HARD TO TALK NAD LISTEN THROUGH THE STERIO I USE MY BLUETOOTH WHNE I AM DRIVING
THERE ARE NO USB PORTS
PERSONALLY I DON T HAVE A USE FOR 99% OF THESE APPLICATIONS I WISH I WOULD OF KNOWN MY SO CALLED UPLEVEL AUDIO SYSTEM WITH BOSE SPEAKERS DIDN T COME WITH A CD PLAYER SOME PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF COULD CARE LESS ABOUT ALL THIS HIGH TECH JUNK O
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE THE CD PLAYER
I RARELY USE ANY OF THIS EQUIPMENT I BOUGHT THIS CAR PURELY FOR THE SENSUAL DRIVING EXPERIENCE NOT FOR AUDIO OR COMMUNICATIONS
CAPABILITY OF MOVIES TO PLAY ON SCREEN
STANDARD SOUND QUALITY
SPEAKERS DO NOT SOUND AS RICH AND CLEAR AS WHAT I WOULD EXPECT FROM BOSE EXCELLENT SYSTEM OTHERWISE
REAL TIME TRAFFIC ALERTS ARE SO OUT OF DATE AS TO BE WORTHLESS IPHONE INTEGRATION VIA USB TRIES TO FORCE PLAYBACK FROM APPLE MUSIC APP DOESN T ALLOW PLAYBACK FROM SPOTOFY OR SOUNDCLOUD THANKFULLY BLUETOOTH PLAYBACK DOESN T HAVE THIS PROBLEM BU
SOUND QUALITY IS NOT A GOOD AS I WOULD LIKE BUT MUCH OF THAT IS DUE TO THE OVERALL SOUND OF THE CAR
MAKE CD PLAYER STANDARD
ALL WEATHER AND NAVIGATION BEST
3G COULD WORK BETTER OVERALL OTHER THAN THE INTERNET CONNECTION IT IS GREAT
WISHED I KNEW HOW TO CONTROL THE IPOD THRU 1 OF THE USP PORTS WOULD LIKE WIFI IN BASIC VEHICLE NOT THRU ONSTAR
THE ABILITY TO RUN THIRD PARTY APPS
BOSE UPGRADE WITH SUBWOOFER IS TOO BOOMY SOMEWHAT UNDAMPED BASS RESPONSE WORST BOSE SYSTEM MY 2004 350Z BOSE SYSTEM IS MUCH MUCH BETTER BUT BEST IS MY 1996 LEXUS LS400 AUDIO SYSTEM WHICH IS PIONEER SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION SOMETIMES DOES NOT WORK
MORE VOICE CONTROL OF FEATURES
RESPONSIVENESS OF NAV SYSTEM
NOW THE RADIO AND ALL THE TOUCH SCREEN DOES WILL TAKE YOU SO TIME TO FIGURE OUT
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETIMES GLICHY THE ENTERTAINMENT WORKS WELL BUT SOMETIMES CANT REMEMBER WHICH OF THE MANY BUTTONS TO USE TO ADJUST SOUND TO BACK ETC
REAL CHANNEL BUTTONS BELOW THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR THE PRESETS THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU TRY TO CHANGE THE RADIO CHANNEL AND THE TOUCH SCREEN DOESN T FEEL YOUR FINGER DUE TO A LONGER FINGERNAIL ALSO IF YOU LIKE TO SCROLL THRU THE CHANNELS YOU HAV
VOICE RECOGNITION THEY ACT LIKE WE ARE SPEAKING A FOREIGN LANUAGE
NEED A CD PLAYER
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS GARBAGE USING ONSTAR
VOICE RECOGNITION PLEASE MAKE IT SIMILAR TO WHAT GOOGLE MAPS DO PERHAPS I HAVEN T SPENT ENOUGH TIME EXPLORING THAT SYSTEM BUT IT WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS AT LEAST A LIST OF COMMANDS INCLUDED IN THE MANUAL SOMEWHERE ONCE I GOT FRUSTRATED WITH
VOICE RECOGNITION INTERACTION IS SLOW
BLUETOOTH DEVICE SYNCING AND VOICE COMMAND RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED
MAKE BLUETOOTH WIFI CONNECTIVITY TO SMARTPHONE MORE CONSISTENT AND RELIABLE SEEMS ONLY TO WORK SPORADICALLY
ALL VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE WIFI WITHOUT USING ONSTAR THE SPEAKERS COULD BE A LOT BETTER WITH SOUND ALL CARS SHOULD HAVE CRUISE CONTROL CAUSE EVERYONE NEEDS ONE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY I CAN T USE MY BLUETOOTH IN THE CAR TO PLAY
HIGHER QUALITY STEREO SYSTEM INCLUDING SPEAKERS IN ALL MODELS THAT COME WITH THE MANUFACTURER STEREO EXAMPLE WOULD BE A BOSE SYSTEM IN ALL MODELS
LET DRIVER MANUALLY CONTROL NAVIGATION WITHOUT HAVING TO USE ONSTAR
IT WON T RECOGNIZE MY ANDROID PHONE YET PLAYS ZUNE WHO THE HELL STILL HAS ONE OF THOSE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOMETIMES DOES NOT ALLOW DESTINATION ENTRY
RELOCATE USB
EASIER TO REACH TOUCH SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION ONLY EFFECTIVE WHEN PARKED EVEN THEN HAS PHONETIC PROBLEMS MUST WAIT THROUGH ENDLESS INSTRUCTIONS AND OPTIONS AND THE PROMPT SIGNAL BEFORE USE
THE USB PORT I HAD TO SWITCH TO AUX
THE SLIDE CONTROL FOR RADIO STATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO USE
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T ALWAYS RECOGNIZE MY COMMANDS
RADIO WITH NAVIGATION SHOULD BE AVAILABLE WITHOUT HAVING TO PURCHASE ALL THE OTHER OPTIONS
SUB WOOFER WOULD BE NICE
I ABSOLUTELY HATE THAT I CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO PROGRAM MY MUSIC FAVORITES I HAVE READ THE OWNERS MANUAL AND IT DOES NOT MATCH THE MODEL OF IMPALA I HAVE I HAVE ALSO TRIED EVERY BUTTON AVAILABLE ON THE SCREENS AND I CANNOT GET IT TO PROGRAM AN
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON THIS CRUZE IS MUCH NICER AND HAS MORE INFO THAN ON MY LAST CRUZE
THERE ARE TOO MANY MENUS TO NAVIGATE THROUGH EASILY WHILE USING AUDIO
VOICE RECOGNITION IS HARD TO USE AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES A MINUTE TO CONNECT TO PANDORA VS XM RADIO
SOURCE BUTTON ON STEERING WHEEL IS DIFFICULT TO USE FASTER INDEX TIME IPOD CATEGORY AND SHUFFLE PREFERENCE REMAINS ACTIVE WHEN STARTING UP AFTER PREVIOUS SHUT DOWN
I WISH I DIDN T HAVE TO HAVE A SUBSCRIPTION FOR THE NAVIGATION WEATHER MOVIES FUEL ETC THE LARGE TOUCH SCREEN IS USELESS UNLESS YOU HAVE THE SIRIUS SUBSCRIPTION
COST OF ONSTAR IS TOO EXPENSIVE IN MY OPINION
SETTING OF RADIO STATIONS VERY DIFFICULT
THE INTERNAL NAV SYSTEM IS SLOW OR INOPERATIVE AND VERY AGGRAVATING
VOICE ACTIVATION NAVIGATOIN SYSTEM
THE MUSIC AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTS WHEN A CALL COMES IN OR I MAKE A VOICE COMMAND BUT IT DOESN T ADJUST TO THE OTHER CABIN NOISE SUCH AS WHEN ACCELERATING OR DECELERATING THE WAY MY LAST CHEVY DID IT MIGHT BE A SETTING BUT I CAN T FIND IT
ONSTAR NAVIGATION SYSTEMS REALLY STICKS I PREFER TO INPUT MY DESTINATION INSTEAD OF HAVING TO CALL THEM OR GO TO MAP QUEST THIS IS ALSO REALLY HARD TO MAKE CHANGES WHEN IN ROUTE AND DOESN T SHOW ANY POINT OF INTEREST
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVED TAKES TOO LONG TO RE ENTER INFO IF IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND
BETTER VOICE COMMAND OF USB SONGS PLAY LED ZEPPELIN 4 OUGHT TO BE CLEAR ENOUGH
WHEN I USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I GUESS THE SYSTEM DOESN T UNDERSTAND ME I SPEAK CLEAR ENGLISH
NAVIGATION SELECTED ROUTES ARE NOR ALWAYS THE SHORTEST OR THE QUICKEST AND ETAS ARE POOR AT BEST
SOUND QUALITY IS POOR FOR BOTH PHONES CALLS AND MUSIC
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PHONE EASE OF SCROLLING THROUGH MENU
THE SOUND QUALITY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HEAR ME IS SAID TO BE POOR
I AM HEARING IMPAIRED AND DO NOT USE THE AUDIO COMMUNICATIONS OR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS MUCH AS I CAN T UNDERSTAND THEM AND IT DISTRACTS FROM MY DRIVING I M AFRAID MY ANSWERS FOR THIS SECTION ARE NOT ACCURATE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED
SINCE THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY BAD WHEN ENTERING NAVIGATION DESTINATIONS AND THE SYSTEM CAN T BE MANUALLY USED WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING THE MANUFACTURER SHOULD CONSIDER ALLOWING THE SYSTEM TO BE MANUALLY ACCESSED WHILE MOVING IF THERE IS
VOICE RECOGNITION BLOWS TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVITY STINKS AUDIO VOICE SOUND GOOD BLUETOOTH GREAT
THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE PRETTY MUCH STINKS IT HAS CALLED PEOPLE I NEVER WANT TO CALL AND WON T CALL THE PEOPLE I DO WANT TO CALL I NEVER USE IT ANYMORE ALSO IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO TOGGLE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT DISPLAYS WHEN USING THE M
TOUCH SCREEN FOR ENTERING DESTINATIONS IS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE DOES NOT SENSE TOUCH OR SKIPS LETTERS AND NUMBERS OFTEN
ITS SO EASY TO CHANGE STATIONS ON THE RADIO YOU DON T HAVE TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD AT ALL
NAVIGATING THE MENUS VOICE COMMANDS NEED TO IMPROVE
THE ONE IN OUR LACROSSE WAS BETTER DON T LIKE THE TOUCHSCREEN INSTEAD OF BUTTONS IT ALSO TAKES MORE TIME AND MULTIPLE SEQUENTIAL TOUCHES TO DO WHAT WAS FASTER AND ONE TOUCH OF A BUTTON BEFORE THE TURN BOX FROM THE NAV SYSTEM IS TOO BIG AND
IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO ADJUST SOUND VOLUME OF RADIO AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS SEPARATELY
NAVIGATION TOO COMPLICATED AND VOICE ACTIVATION IS AWFUL SHE DOESN T UNDERSTAND SIMPLE COMMANDS MOST OF THE TIME ONLY THING SHE SEEMS TO REALY UNDERSTAND IT CANCEL ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM HARD TO GO FROM AM TO FM TO SAT
NAVIGATION PANEL NOT VIVID ENOUGH LOOKS WASHED OUT HARD TO SEE
CONTINUE TO SIMPLY THE GUI AT THE MOMENT YOU HAVE TOO MANY OPTIONS MENU FEATURES TO NAVIGATE PERHAPS IF YOU COULD ALLOW THE DRIVER TO CUSTOMIZE THE GUI FOR THOSE APPS THEY USE MOST THAT WOULD BE BEST
+OFTEN HANDS FREE CALLING OPERATOR DOES NOT GET INFORMATION  NUMBERS CPRRECTLY
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE EASIER TO MANIPULATE THE ON SCREEN NEEDS TO BE EASIER CONTROLS NEED TO BE STREAMLINED
MORE APPS THAN I NEED
I BELIEVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD DEFAULT TO A LARGER GEOGRAPHICAL AREA I FIND THE STANDARD DEFAULT LIMITING
CONNECTING TO BLUETOOTH PHONE IS NOT SIMPLE AND DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK SPECIALLY WITH MULTIPLE PHONES USING THE IN DASH NAVIGATION IS CUMBERSOME SO I HAVE FAVORED USING MY PHONES NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR CHANGING STATIONS AND MENU OPTIONS IS DIFFICULT TO USE SOMETIMES IT RESPONDS IMMEDIATELY AND OTHER TIMES ONE HAS TO TOUCH THE SCREEN MANY TIMES TO EFFECT A CHANGE SOMETIMES IT CHANGES TO AN OPTION THAT YOU DON T WANT
PROGRAMMING THE NAV IS DIFFICULT THE TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS FOR PROGRAMMED STATIONS ARE HORRIBLE NOT EASY TO SELECT AND NAVIGATE THEM
KEYBOARD FOR ENTERING DESTINATION ADDRESS DISAPPEARS BEFORE ADDRESS IS COMPLETED GUESSES WHAT THE ADDRESS WILL BE BEFORE COMPLETED AND OCCASIONALLY IS INCORRECT
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BLUE RAY FOR VIDEO SYSTEM
ENTERING THE ADDRESS FOR NAVIGATION IS CLUNKY WE HAD A GARMIN PREVIOUSLY AND I LIKED HOW GARMIN HAD US ENTER THE STATE FIRST ONLY THE FIRST FEW LETTERS WERE NECESSARY AFTER THAT IT MADE SUGGESTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM THEN THE STREET ADDRESS AG
CANNOT USE THE TEXTING FEATURE
VOICE COMMAND AND WRITING OPTION OFTEN DO NOT WORK
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY POOR DOES NOT RESET PROPERLY IF YOU CHANGE OR TAKE A DIFFERENT ROUTE KEEPS ASKING YOU TO MAKE A U TURN TO GO BACK TO THEIR ROUTE HAVE GOOGLE SET IT UP FOR YOU I NOW HAVE TO USE MY SMARTPHONE FOR NAVIGATION
I HAVE GONE BACK TO THE DEALER TWICE TO HAVE THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM CONNECTED IT SEEMS TO BE OK NOW
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE ADD NAVIGATION TO THE BUICK WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THRU ONSTAR THAT WAS NOT AN OPTION WITH THE LEATHER PACKAGE ON THIS VEHICLE
NAV SYSTEM SOMETIMES INSTRUCTS TO MAKE U TURN FOR NO REASON IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE NAV SYSTEM ANNOUNCES THE NAME OF THE STREET TO TURN ONTO INSTEAD OF SAYING TURN IN 400 YDS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN WHICH MAKES IT HARDER TO PROGRAM DESTINATION
TOUCH SCREEN DOES NOT RESPOND VERY WELL
WOULD BE NICE IF NAVIGATION SYSTEM RESPONDED TO VOICE COMMANDS MAYBE IT DOES AND I DO NOT KNOW THAT
IF IT DIDN T DEFAULT TO IPHONE SOURCE FOR MUSIC WHEN PLUGGING IT IN TO CHARGE
VOICE RECOGNITION ALTHOUGH IN OTHER VEHICLES THAT I VE HAD THAT HAD THIS FEATURE I HAD ENCOUNTERED PROBLEMS SIMILAR TO THESE
WHEN USE SUB TO CHARGE PHONE THE AUDIO SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHS TO IPOD MODE AND PLAYS A U2 SONG
I WOULD LOVE IF THE CAR HAD THE ABILITY TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THROUGH THE TOUCH SCREEN VERSUS CALLING ONSTAR OR SENDING DIRECTIONS TO THE VEHICLE
INTEGRATION WITH GOOGLE MAPS FROM SMARTPHONE AND ABILITY TO SEND A DESTINATION FROM MY PHONE TO THE THE VEHICLE NAV SYSTEM BY BLUETOOTH OR SOME OTHER SIMPLE METHOD
MANUALLY ENTERING NAVIGATION ADDRESSES IS TIME CONSUMING AND TEDIOUS
THE VOICE NEVER UNDERSTANDS WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR AND THEREFORE I NEED TO PUT IN MY DESTINATION
DON T CARE FOR TOUCH SCREEN APPLICATION IT S HARD TO WORK AND A DISTRACTION AS YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THE ROAD TO LOOK AT THE ICON IN ORDER TO PUSH IT CORRECTLY
THERE IS A SLIGHT DELAY IN RESPONSE WHEN CHANGING SATELLITE STATIONS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN LIKEWISEA DELAY WHEN DOING PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING ON THE TOUCH SCREEN OR WHEN USING THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS WOULD LIKE INSTANTANEOUS RESPONSE WHEN PUSHING
WORK OFTEN AND WELL PHONE CALLS DIFFICULT WHEN VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T WORK WELL THE NAVIGATION IF UPDATED WOULD BE OUTSTANDING RATHER THAN USELESS
DEFINITELY NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEED IMPROVE
MORE SENSITIVE SPEAKER PHONE THAT PICKS UP YOUR VOICE MORE CLEARLY TO PERSON RECEIVING CALL
BIGGER BETTER SCREEN LESS INFO ON SCREEN FREE UP THE THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE NAV SYSTEM
I AM OLDER AND PREFER TO HAVE BUTTONS FOR MY STATIONS THE TOUCH SCREEN IS HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING AND I DON T FEEL COMFORTABLE TRYING TO USE THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL AS IT REQUIRES TOO MUCH CONCENTRATION FROM ME JUST NOT USED TO
THE QUALITY OF SOUND FROM THE SPEAKERS SEEMS TO BE AIMED MORE TOWARDS THE VOICE CONTROLS THAN THE MUSIC
I REALLY DISLIKE THE SOFTWARE THAT DRIVES THE AUDIO AND NAVIGATION IT IS NOT EASY TO NAVIGATE AND DEFINITELY NOT INTUITIVE I WOULD HAVE RATED THE SYSTEM MUCH HIGHER IF IT WAS NOT FOR THE SOFTWARE
THE TOUCH SCREEN TO CHANGE STATIONS IN UNRELIABLE AND DIFFICULT TO USE
PRACTICALLY 85% OF CELL PHONE USERS USE ANDROID HAVING A VEHICLE SET FOR I PHONES IS ANNOYING
THE DEALER COULD HAVE EXPLAINED HOW TO USE THE WIFI AND EXPLAINED THE CONTROLS ON THE STEREO BETTER
THE TOUCHSCREEN IN MY RAV4 IS MUCH EASIER TO USE WHILE DRIVING
IF VEHICLE IS RUNNING AND YOU GET IN YOU CAN NOT CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH UNTIL THE CAR HAS BEEN SHUT OFF AND THEN TURNED BACK ON
USB AUDIO FILES NEED TO BE ABLE TO BE SORTED ALPHABETICALLY
DON T LIKE THE ONSTAR NAV SYSTEM WOULD PREFER SOMETHING THAT SHOWED A MORE ROBUST MAP INSTEAD OF TURN BY TURN NAV THAT DOESN T REALLY GIVE AN OVERVIEW OR SENSE OF ACTUAL LOCATION
THE SOUND QUALITY VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN ACCESSING THE VARIOUS FEATURES REPETITION IS USUALLY NEEDED TO GET CONNECTIONS
IT TRIES TO BE A BIT TOO FUTURISTIC SIMPLER WOULD BE BETTER EASIER TO NAVIGATE MORE INTERACTIVE MORE INTUITIVE
VOICE RECOGNITION BLUETOOTH NEEDS IMPROVEMENT DOSE NOT RECOGNIZE MY CONTACTS
TOO MANY CONFLICTING FUNCTIONS ON THE SCREEN THAT ARE DISTRACTING MY IPOD IS PARTICULALRY DIFFICULT TO USE IT S AN OLDER CLASSIC MODEL WITH LOTS OF SONGS AND IT TAKES TOO LONG FOR THE SYSTEM TO DOWNLOAD MY MUSIC I WIND UP OPERATING IT MANU
GET RID OF THE CONSOLE BUTTONS HAVE A LARGER TOUCH SCREEN THAT CAN SHOW MORE CONTROLS AT ONCE
ADD NAVIGATION AS A STD FEATURE
IT SHOULD HAVE NAVIGATION USING IT ON ONSTAR IS GOOD BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT
TRYING TO ASK FOR NAVIGATION VIA VOICE REC WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IF YOU COULD CORRECT WRONG STREET BY SPELLING I FINALLY STOPPED AND USED TOUCH SCREEN ALSO DESPITE MULTIPLE TRIES CAN T MAKE WIFI HOTSPOT WORK
CAN I REMOVE THE XM RADIO FEATURES IF I DON T SUBSCRIBE
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CONFUSING TO ACCESS
RADIO STATION AND MODE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE NEEDED TOO AWKWARD TO REACH THE PANEL WHEN DRIVING EASIER INTEGRATION OF MOBILE PHONE TO DISPLAY FOR NAV PURPOSES IS NEEDED AND A BACK UP CAMERA WOULD BE NICE
I HIGHLIGHTED ON THAT PREVIOUSLY HAVING TO REPEAT MYSELF TO BE TOLD I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR REQUEST ON THE NAVIGATION I HAVE YET TO HAVE IT WORK WHEN I SPEAK AN ADDRESS I ALWAYS HAVE TO TYPE IT OR USE ONSTAR
TOUCHSCREEN IS OVERLY COMPLICATED AND REQUIRES TOO MANY ACTIONS TO DO A GIVEN TASK CLIMATE AND AUDIO CONTROLS SHOULD HAVE DEDICATED BUTTONS SWITCHES KNOBS NAVIGATING THROUGH THE TOUCHSCREEN IS AN EXERCISE IN TECHNOLOGY FOR THE SAKE OF TECHNOLOGY
PANDORA IS UNABLE TO CONNECT DIRECTLY IT NEEDS A CELL PHONE TO CONNECT
WE VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES WITH LEARNING THE VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM WE WIND UP USING ON STAR
NEVER GETS A VOICE COMMAND RIGHT TOO MANY STEPS IN ACCOMPLISHING TSKS CAN KILL YOURSELF ON ROAD TRYING TO CHANGE STATIONS OR NAVIGATE RIDICULOUS
MAP UPDATES MORE FREQUENT
RUNNING EVERYTHING THROUGH TOUCHSCREEN MENUS FORCES A CHOICE BETWEEN DRIVING OR ADJUSTING THE AUDIO NAVIGATION SYSTEM CANNOT BE USED SAFELY WHILE DRIVING
AUDIO AND CLIMATE CONTROLS TOO CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER AND IT WOULD BE NICE IF SIRIUS COULD REMEMBER ALERTED SONGS WITHOUT USING PHONE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A JOKE ITS EASIER TO USE THE APP ON MY PHONE THE NAV SYSTEM TAKES WAY TO MANY STEPS AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PHYSICAL ADDRESS CAN NOT PUT IN A BUSINESS OR JUST THE CITY WASTE OF TIME
ROUTE GUIDANCE AND CLARITY OF HEARING CALLERS
NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ALL DEVICE EXAMPLE IPHONE 4 DOES NOT WORK WITH VOICE CONTROLS
I MENTIONED IN AN EARLIER SECTION MY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE AUDIO CONTROLS ALSO I PURCHASED THE PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM BUT IT MEDIOCRE COMPARED TO OTHER BRANDS I VE OWNED THE AUDIO CLARITY AND IMAGING AND SOUND QUALITY IS JUST NOT QUITE WHAT I
AT TIME THE SOUND IS GARBLED I DON T KNOW IF THIS IS THE CAR OR THE CELL PHONE I HAVE
MAKE THE IN CAR WIFI SYSTEM EASIER TO SET UP
MANUAL CENTER STACK MOUNTED CONTROLS FOR RADIO AND HVAC SYSTEMS VERSUS RELIANCE ON CAPACITIVE SWITCHES AND TOUCH DISPLAY
HAVE TRIED A FEW TIMES TO USE VOICE COMMANDS TO OPERATE DIFFERENT THINGS BUT USUALLY ENDED UP DOING IT MANUALLY PRETTY MUCH GAVE UP ON AUTO STUFF I LIKE THINGS TO WORK WHEN I WANT THEM TO
REMOTE CONTROL OF THE VEHICLE HAS TO GO THROUGH ONSTAR AND EITHER THE ONSTAR CONNECTION OR THE ONSTAR SERVERS HAVE PROBLEMS RELAYING SIGNALS APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE TIME AT THAT RATE A DYNAMIC DNS SERVICE WITH DIRECT CONNECTION FROM PHONE TO C
MORE INTUITIVE NAVIGATION ENTRY CONTROLS AND SEARCH
DISPLAY TOO HARD TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING
MORE SOUNDPROOFING ACTIVE NOISE CANCELATION TECHNOLOGY
MAKE A CD PLAYER AVAILABLE AGAIN
IF YOU ARE LISTENING TO IPAD THAT YOU SHOULDN T HAVE TO LISTEN TO RADIO TOO
ADD HANDS FREE TEXTING COMPATIBILITY FOR IPHONES
PHONE CALLS AND TEXT MESSAGES ARE SUPER LOUD
I WOULD LIKE NORMAL BUTTONS FOR MEMORY PRESETS
I PAID EXTRA FOR A BOSE SOUND SYSTEM AND IT SOUND AVERAGE AT BEST NOT IMPRESSED MY JETTA HAD MUCH BETTER SOUND QUALITY
MAKE THE GPS EASE OF USE SIMILIAR TO GARMIN AUTOMOTIVE GPS UNITS
WHILE USING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION AND PASSENGER PLUGS IN THE USB PORT THE SYSTEM WILL TRY AND READ THE USB PORT EVEN AFTER SETTING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION CAN BE PROBLEMATIC
I DO NOT KNOW PURCHASED IN LATE NOV AND HAVEN T HAD ANYONE HERE TO USE THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEMS
HARD DISK DRIVES IN COST VERY LITTLE WHY THE STINGINESS WITH CAPACITY AS MEWNTIONED BEFORE I AM EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
IF THE CAR IS SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW THERE IS A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT WITH THE USE OF SEAT BELTS WHY CAN T THE PASSENGER HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITHOUT HAVING TO STOP THE CAR TO PUT IN A DESTINATION
VOICE COMMANDS ARE NOT GOOD TOUCH SCREEN IS SMALL DVD IS TOUGH TO CONTROL FROM FRONT WHILE DRIVING W  CHILD IN CHILD SEAT SAT RADIO IS A LITTLE FUZZY AT TIMES
RECOGNITION DIFFICULTIES OF CELL PHONE CONTACT AND NUMBERS FAILURE TO HAVE OPTION FOR TOUCH AND CALL
I WISH I COULD GET MUSIC INFORMATION WHILE LISTENING THROUGH BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
YOU CAN HEAR PHONE CONVERSATION OUTSIDE VEHICLE IT IS LOUD OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE ALSO IF I AM TALKING ON THE PHONE USING BLUETOOTH IN VEHICLE IT IS AWKWARD SWITCHING BACK TO THE PHONE WHEN I REACH MY DESTINATION AND EXIT THE VEHICLE
I HAD AN AFTER MARKET DVD PLAYER INSTALLED THE RADIO RECEPTION IS NOT VERY GOOD IT HAS A LOT OF STATIC
SIZE OF DISPLAY SCREEN COULD BE LARGER
LOCATION AND NUMBER OF USB PORTS FOR CHARGING AND USE OF DEVICE THRU SPEAKERS
I HAVE NOT SET UP THE VEHICLES AUDIO COMMUNICATION SYSTEM DON T KNOW HOW
WE HAVE NO NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IN OUR VEHICLE
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE CD
BETTER CONNECTIVITY WITH PHONES FOR MUSIC AND CALLS ALSO THE TWO SUBWOOFERS IN THE TRUNK IS A BIT MUCH ONE WOULD BE PLENTY OR NONE TO SAVE SOME WEIGHT
WHEN USING THE IPOD IF YOU SEARCH BY ARTIST IT IS ALPHABETICAL IF I HAVE MORE THAN ONE ALBUM BY AN ARTIST WITH A NAME STARTING WITH Z I HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH THE WHOLE LIST TO FIND THE ARTIST AND THEN PICK A DIFFERENT ALBUM INSTEAD OF GOING
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD USE SOME WORK SOMETIMES NEED TO REPEAT WORDS TO GET IT TO RESPOND PROPERLY
THE VOICE RECOGNITION COULD B MUCH BETTER
A BASIC SYSTEM I REALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF TOUCHSCREEN OR NAVIGATION BUTTONS TO USE THE AUDIO SYSTEM IT IS MOSTLY VOLUME AND TUNER THAT IS GREAT
ITS A CAR NOT A COMMUNI8CATION CENTER THESE THINGS ARE NOT NEEDED IN A CAR YOU ONLY NEED A RADIO AND CD PLAYER PERIOD
WHEN I HAVE A PASSENGER AND I KNOW THAT CAN BE DETECTED AUTOMATICALLY THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL I UNDERSTAND DISABLING TYPING FOR THE DRIVER BUT IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE PASSENGER IS PREVENTED FROM ASSISTING WHENEVE
AGAIN CD PLAYER
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF MY VOICE COMMANDS
VOICE RECOGNITION TO PAGE BACK BETWEEN SCREENS SHIFT LIGHT ON SCAT PACK DODGE PERFORMANCE PAGES SCAT PACK BEE LOGO DISPLAY ON STARTUP
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND
I WISH MY CAR HAD A CD PLAYER IN IT
IT SHOULD HAVE HAD AN CD PLAYER IN THE VEHICLE EVERYONE DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTERS
THE QUALITY OF THE HANDSFREE CALLING LOWERS THE OVERALL RATING CALLED PARTIES COMPLAIN ABOUT THE NOISE LEVEL THERE ARE HIGH QUALITY NOISE CANCELLING HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGIES WHICH COULD BE INSTALLED
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS MY ONLY POINT OF CONTENTION THE RECOGNITION OF NAMES COULD BE IMPROVED IN REFERENCE TO PLACES OF BUSINESSES
PHONE OFFERS HANDS FREE DEVICE FOR CALLS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HANDS FREE FOR TEXT MESSAGING ALSO
THE ACTUAL SOUND QUALITY COULD BE IMOROVED
BE ABLE TO READ SEND TEXT MESSAGES FROM APPLE DEVICES
THE SYSTEM WILL NOT GET MESSAGES FROM MY PHONE PHONE IS SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 RUNNING ANDROID 5 0 2
SIRIUS NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAD A RECALL OR PROBLEM WITH ALL OF THESE VEHICLES SHOULD BE RESOLVED WE ARE TOLD BY END OF FIRST QUARTER
I WISH IT HAD CD PLAYER CHANGER AS STANDARD WITH THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM I WILL LOOK INTO ADDING THE FACTORY STYLE PLAYER IF IT S NOT OVER PRICED I HAVE HUNDRED S OF CD S BUT AM CURRENTLY UNABLE TO PLAY THEM ON THIS FANTASTIC 506 WATT SOUND SY
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS BETTER COVERAGE AND VOICE RECOGNITION
THE VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVEMENT OR THE MICROPHONE NEEDS BETTER PLACEMENT IT CONSTANTLY REGISTERS THE INCORRECT NAME
IPHONE INTERGRATION
THE U CONNECT INTERACTION WITH APPLE IPHONES COULD BE UPDATED TO ENABLE TEXT MESSAGING
I PHONE 5 INTERFACE IS HORRIBLE THE UCONNECT UPDATE TAKES TO LONG SO YOU CAN NOT SEE YOUR ORGANIZED PLAYLISTS TO SELECT AND PLAY MUSIC EASILY
UCONNECT WON T SYNC WITH TEXTING ON FROM TO MY BRAND NEW SMARTPHONE
THE HANDS FREE PHONE IS HARD TO PICK UP CALLS
THE PHONE SYSTEM IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY 09 RAM IN REGARDS TO MAKING MORE THAN ONE CALL ONE AFTER THE OTHER WILL NOT ALLOW ME TO HANG UP AND IMMEDIATELY MAKE ANOTHER CALL AS THOUGH TIME NEEDS TO PROCESS BETWEEN PHONE AND RADIO
I FEEL THAT ALL THE SHOULD HAVE THE 8 INCH TOUCH SCREEN WITH ALL THE FEATHERS IN IT IT S REALLY SAD THAT I CAN NOT GET THE RADIO INSTALLED AT A DODGE DEALERSHIP HOWEVER I CAN GET A SUNROOF IN STALLED AT THE DEALERSHIP
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A GARMIN LIKE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OPTION
THROUGH THE USB CONNECTING A IPOD IT IS GREAT HAVING EVERYTHING APPEAR ON THE TOUCHSCREEN PLAYLISTS ARTISTS AWESOME EASY TO USE I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH THE HANDS FREE VOICE RECOGNITION TEXTS GOING TO WRONG PEOPLE CALLING WRONG PEOP
VOLUME CONTROL ON STEERING WHEELS WHICH IS STANDARD ON A LOT OF OTHER VEHICLES VOICE RECOGNITION IS SHODDY
TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVITY SOMETIMES TAKES WAY TOO MUCH FORCE TO GET IT TO REGISTER
DOES NOT DUE VOICE COMMANDS NAVIGATION IS NOT EASY TO OPERATE ENTIRE VOICE COMMAND IN CAR IS NOT HELPFUL
WISH IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THE PASSENGER TO INPUT ADDRESSES WHILE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION
AT THIS POINT I BELIEVE THAT BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE IN EVERY VEHICLE
THE VIEW ON THE NAV SYSTEM IS AWFUL THE ABILITY TO NARROW IN AND OUT OF MAP IS NOT VERY GOOD
NAV IS UNACCEPTABLE RATHER HAVE A PAPER MAP
DIFFICULT TO SYNC UP WITH PHONES TAKES A LONG TIME TO SYNC LOAD
NAVIGATION DETAIL IS TERRIBLE THE IMAGE QUALITY LOOKS VERY CHEAP RESOLUTION IS TOO LOW
NO CD PLAYER KIND OF STUPID
THE VOICE ACTIVATION
SO FAR I M NOT ABLE TO USE OTHER VOICE COMMAND THAT THE PHONE SYSTEM
IMPROVED BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY QUALITY
THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS VERY USER FRIENDLY I M NOT ELECTRONICALLY SAVVY SO I M VERY PLEASED THE SYSTEM IS NOT COMPLICATED BUT YET STILL VERY HIGH TECH
JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE U CONNECT IS JUNK I JUST WANTED A REGULAR AUDIO SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE MUCH MORE USABLE IF IT WORKED WHEN VEHICLE WAS IN MOTION ITS NOT A SAFETY ISSUE PASSENGER CAN PROGRAM IT I FIND IT MORE DANGEROUS TO PULL OVER
THE GPS COORDINATES ROUTE MAPPING DOES NOT WORK WELL FOR DIRT ROADS GOING FROM PAVED AREA TO A LOCATION ON A DIRT ROAD WORK OK BUT WHEN STARTING FROM A GPS LOCATION ON A DIRT ROAD THE NAV SYSTEM CANNOT GUIDE YOU TO ANOTHER GPS COORDINATION LOCA
THIS MAY NOT BE A FAIR COMPLAINT BUT MY PREVIOUS 2003 DODGE RAM HAD AN AFTERMARKET RADIO WITH A WIRELESS REMOTE TO CHANGE VOLUME & MUSIC TRACKS THE NEW RAM RADIO CONTROL IS ON THE FAR RIGHT OF THE HEAD UNIT AND CHANGING TRACKS IS VERY DIFFICULT A
SPEED OF NAVIGATION SOFTWARE TO FILTER THROUGH STREETS WHEN TYPING IN THE ADDRESS ALMOST LIKE IF THERE WAS A COOKIE FEATURE WHICH REMEMBERED YOUR FREQUENT INPUTS THAT WOULD SPEED UP ENTERING IN AN ADDRESS
SOUND QUALITY ON PHONE CALLS IS NOT IDEAL
RELOCATE THE CD PLAYER SO IT IS ACCESSABLE
SOME APPLICATIONS REQUIRE THE VEHICLE TO BE IN PARK UNDERSTANDING THE SAFETY ISSUES IT IS NOT ALWAYS CONVENIENT TO PULL OVER & PARK OR DESIROUS TO USE THE HANDS FREE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURES BUT THE OPTION TO CHANGE ROUTES IN NAVIGATION SYSTE
IT WOULD BE REALLY COOL IF WHILE PLAYING A VIDEO FROM MY CELL PHONE THE VIDEO COULD PLAY ON THE MEDIA SCREEN
NOT SURE HOW I FEEL ABOUT THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO PAY TO HAVE MY SYSTEM UPGRADED OR FOR THE DOWNLOADING OF THE NAVIGATION INFORMATION
JUST WISH I HAD A CD PLAYER IN MY SYSTEM
PUTTING USB PORT ON DASH INSTEAD OF IN CONSOLE
NEED IMPROVE THE MAPS ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN NEEDS TO HAVE MORE COLOR GREY AND BLACK COLORS FOR MOST OF THE MAPS ARE NOT SATISFYING I HAVE OTHER VEHICLES WITH GREAT MAP COLOR RATIO
THE VOICE COMMAND NEEDS A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT>
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE STANDARD FOR THIS PACKAGE
CHOICE OF FASTEST SHORTEST ROUTES AT ADDRESS ENTRY
THE BUILT IN MIC WHEN USING HANDS FREE
RESPONSE TIME TO VOICE COMMANDS
I M NOT A TECHNO NERD AND I DON T PLAN ON CONTINUING THE ON STAR SERVICES AFTER THE FREE 6 MONTHS ITS HARD FOR ME TO RATE THESE ITEMS AS I DON T USE THEM I D RATHER THE CAR CAME WITH CRUISE CONTROL
VOICE CONTROL IS HARD TO USE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE VOICE CONTROL AT TIMES
SMARTPHONE RECEPTION IS NOT GOOD
NOT THE SYSTEM SO MUCH AS THE SURVEY YOU ASK IF I USE A MOBILE DEVICE WITH USB BUT LUMP THEM ALL TOGETHER I USE THE USB FOR MY IPOD I USE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION FOR MY PHONE BECAUSE I AM UNABLE TO CONNECT MORE THAN ONE DEVICE WITH BLUETOOTH
MORE MICROPHONES WITHIN THE VEHICLE SO IF THE DRIVER IS BUSY DRIVING THE PASSENGER CAN ASK FOR DIRECTIONS USE THE COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN THE VEHICLE
I WISH IT HAD CARPLAY SUPPORT
EASE TO ADD FEATURES SUCH AS SATELLITE RADIO
DON T CARE FOR SET UP OF TOUCH SCREEN WOULD PREFER TO JUST HAVE PRE SET BUTTONS FOR RADIO TUNING
WHEN USING BLUETOOTH TO MAKE CALL SYSTEM HAS A TENDENCY TO UNDERSTAND WHO I SAY TO CALL
BUILT IN NAV NOT JUST ONSTAR ONSTAR HAS BROUGHT ME TO THE WRONG PLACE AT TIMES
IMPROVED NAVIGATION FOR LOCATING VALID ADDRESSES
I THINK A DISPLAY DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER WOULD ADD SAFETY AND EASE OF USE
THE NAVIGATION DOES NOT UNDERSTAND CLEARLY STATED COMMANDS
SPEAKERS ARE THE WEAK POINT I USE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY NOT MENTIONED ON SURVEY WHEN USING IPHONES SOURCED CONTENT TYPICALLY AUDIBLE THOUGH SOMETIMES PANDORA AND GOOGLEPLAY MUSIC
MY CAR DIDN T COME WITH A USB I DON T HAVE A CD PLAYER WHICH IS FINE BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO HOOK UP AN MP3 PLAYER IPHONE ETC VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING
BAD RECEPTION TAKES TOO LONG TO CONNECT AND SWITCH CHANNELS BLUETOOTH DOESN T WORK
NAVIGATION CANNOT LOCATE TRAFFIC AS I COULD IN MY TRAVERSE ALSO ENTERING THE ADDRESS TAKES LONG AS YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN MANUALLY IN MY PAST TRAVERSE AS YOU WOULD START TYPING IT WOULD POP UP CHOICES FOR CITY STREET NAME ETC THIS IS TIME C
NOT NEEDING TO USE ONSTAR TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE NOT INTUITIVE
MY PHONE IS EASIER TO USE TO NAVIGATE THAN GETTING HELP FROM THE CAR NAV
NAVIGATION SYSTEM ACCURACY UPDATES TOO EXPENSIVE TOO FEW UPDATES EACH YEAR AND EASE OF DESTINATION ENTRY
I MISS THE ABILITY TO HAVE 5 DISC CD AND REAR ENTERTAINMENT SEPERATE FROM THE RADIO
SPEAKERS ARE NOT OF GREAT QUALITY VOICE CONTROL SHOULD SUPPORT MORE THAN JUST IPHONES
THERE ARE HUGE LETTERS FOR FM AM XM BUT TINY LETTERS TELLING THE NAME OF THE SONG AND ARTIST TRYING TO READ THE INFORMATION I FIND INTERESTING IS A DISTRACTION TO DRIVING ALSO I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT A NAVIGATION IS NO LONGER INCLUDED FREE
THE SYSTEM IS VERY COMPLICATING AND LIMITING I WOULD ASSUME THE TOUCH SCREEN WOULD MAKE ACCESSING THE APPLICATION EASY BUT IT DOESN T
CUE SYSTEM LOOKS GREAT BUT FUNCTIONALITY COULD BE IMPROVED TOUCH SCREEN IS TEMPERAMENTAL BRING BACK CONTROL KNOBS FOR THE HEATER AC AND THE AUDIO SYSTEM
SYSTEM LACKS THE ABILITY TO SHOW POI S FOR DESTINATION MERCEDES HAS THIS FEATURE
IT COULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED IF CADILLAC NEVER BUILT THIS ESCALADE JUST TO MAKE ANOTHER MODEL S WHICH IS BETTER IN EVERYWAY OFFERS WIFI ETC
CONTROLLING THE DVD PLAYER FRONT FRONT SCREEN NOT HAVING TO BE IN PARK
USING VOICE COMMANDS TO ENTER DESTINATION ADDRESSES MUST BE IMPROVED IT IS FAR TOO DIFFICULT TO DO CURRENTLY AND RARELY WORKS PROPERLY THE PROCESS IS CUMBERSOME AND SHOULD BE SIMPLIFIED
I REALLY ONLY USE THE SATALITE RADIO AND MOSTLY THE SAME STATION
THE CUE SYSTEM TAKES A LONG WHILE TO GET USED TO YOU SHOULD TRAIN YOURSELF WELL ON USING IT BEFORE YOU DRIVE IT MAKES YOU TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF THE ROAD FOR TOO LONG LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT SCREEN BUTTONS BUT THE DISPLAY IS GREAT THE VOICE REC
I WISH THEY JUST WOULD PUT VOLUME AND TUNING NOBS ON THE DASH THEY USE THESE HAPTIC SWIPE BARS THAT ARE A PAIN I JUST USE THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS INSTEAD
THE VOLUME CONTROL ON THE PHONE IS HARD TO ADJUST CHANGING OUT A CD ON THE SINGLE PLAY IS NOT CONVENIENT DIDN T REALIZE THE CAR DID NOT HAVE A MULTI CD CHANGER MY ERROR
IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I WISH IT SHOWED THE VEHICLE GOING FORWARD UP ON THE SCREEN RATHER THAN NORTH SOUTH EAST OR WEST I KNOW I AM NOT EXPLAINING THIS VERY WELL BUT ON MY DENALI THE CAR WAS ALWAYS HEADED UP ON THE SCREEN AND NOW IT SHOWS
NAVIGATION POINTS OF INTEREST ARE REALLY BAD THEY DO NOT COME UP
SETTING UP FAVORITE RADIO STATIONS
TO COMPLICATED AND YOU CAN T PLAY AN AUDIO BOOK FROM A DEVICE CONNECTED TO THE USB PORT
TOUCH SCREEN TO SENSITIVE
RETURN TO THE ROUTE GUIDANCE ON STAR SYSTEM SHOWING REAL TIME EXITS AND ENTRANCES BY NUMBER ON THE INTERSTATE SYSTEM USING SPLIT SCREEN AS IT WAS IN OUR CRX ALSO ADD REAL TIME INFO ON TRAFIC AND COSTRUCTION HOLD UPS
IMPROVE ACCURACY OF VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION  HANDS FREE CONTROL DOESN T WORK WELL GETS PHONE NUMBERS WRONG AND GETS COMMANDS WRONG SOMETIMES SOMETIMES EASIER TO JUST USE YOUR HANDS
MAP DISPLAY SHOULD INCLUDE CURRENT SPEED AND SPEED LIMIT MORE DETAIL AVAILABLE IN MAP CONTROL OF ENTIRE SYSTEM CAN BE CONFUSING
DIFFICULT TO USE ANYTHING ON TOUCHSCREEN NEVER GOT SUFFICIENT INSTRUCTION FROM DEALER ABOUT HOW TO USE ALL VOICE COMMANDS AVAILABLE
VOICE COMMANDS ARE VERY USER FRIENDLY
MAKE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MORE LIKE IPHONE OR GOOGLE ITS TOO CLUNKY
THE PHONE SYSTEM SOUND IS TERRIBLE
USB PORTS IN THIRD ROW THERE ARE SEVERAL IN FRONT ONLY ONE IN SECOND ROW AND NONE IN THIRD ROW WITH 4 KIDS NEED PORTS IN ALL ROWS
THE NAVIGATION USE A GARMIN
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER TEXTS ELECTRONICALLY
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE TOUCH SCREEN DIFFICULT TO DO WHILE DRIVING UNLIKE A BUTTON ON THE DASH YOU CAN JUST PUSH
I WISH MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM WORKED
GET RID OF THE CUE SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS AVERAGE AT BEST IT IS SLOW AND THE LIVE TRAFFIC FEATURE IS USELESS BECAUSE IT IS SO INACCURATE MUSIC PLAYBACK THROUGH THE USB INTERFACE IS BELOW AVERAGE THE IS A 4 TO 5 SECOND DELAY WHEN CHANGING SONGS AND THE DISPL
LESS TOUCH SCREEN APPLICATION
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION
COMMUNICATION RECEPTION DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ADDRESSES VERY WELL NEED TO BE SO DETAILED IT TAKES AS MUCH TIME TO ENTER DIRECT RATHER THEN VERBAL
THE NAV SYSTEM DOESN T WORK FOR SQUAT WITH REGARDS TO ENTERING REQUESTING A DESTINATION SO WE USE OUR MOBILE PHONE SYSTEMS INSTEAD
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION IS NOT AS ACCURATE AS IT SHOULD BE
BLUETOOTH MUSIC PLAYBACK WAS SOMETHING I REALLY THOUGHT WAS A FEATURE WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE ONLY TO FIND OUT THAT BLUETOOTH IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO MAKE PHONE CALLS SEEMS LIKE ONLY A SOFTWARE THING RATHER THAN A HARDWARE DILEMMA
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE YOU ARE FORCED TO USE ONSTAR SERVICES FOR NAVIGATION NOTHING PRE LOADED INTO SYSTEM YOU CANT JUST TURN ON NAVIGATION AND SEE MAPS YOU MUST ENTER A DESTINATION ONLINE BEFORE LEAVING OR CALL ONSTAR AND GIVE THEM
GAL TALKS TO MUCH SHOULD GET MORE TO THE POINT QUICKLY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND VOICE COMMANDS
POOR VOICE RECOGNITION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T ALWAYS RECOGNIZE WHAT I AM SAYING
SOMETIMES DOES NOT RECOGNIZE VOICE COMMANDS
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ADD A CONTACT TO THE MEMORY SCREEN USING THE TOUCH SCREEN
WHEN I VE USED THE STEERING WHEEL HANDS FREE COMMAND FOR PHONE CALLS THERE IS NO WAY TO END THE CALL IF I USE ONSTAR OR MY CELL PHONE END APPEARS ON THE SCREEN NOT SO WHEN I USE THE STEERING WHEEL ICON
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT INTUITIVE AND NO GOOD INSTRUCTIONS
I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO USE MY NAVIGATION IT QUIT WORKING BOUT 2 WEEKS AFTER GOT THE VEHICLE WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS CONTROLS FOR THE DVD IN THE BACK SO I DIDN T HAVE TO CHANGE AND START MOVIES WHILE DRIVING
DIFFICULTY GETTING NAVIGATION TO WORK PROPERLY DIFFICULTY GIVING AUDIO COMMANDS AND WITH RECOGNITION DIFFICULTY WITH SATELLITE RECEPTION
MISS THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL WITHIN FM OR SIRUS WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
SOUND QUALITY IS REALLY GOOD NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A BIT TRICKY TO NAVIGATE BACK AND FORTH TAKES A WHILE TO ENTER POI S EASIER TO JUST NAVIGATE WITH MY PHONE DROP PIN OR USE CURRENT LOCATION TO NAVIGATE WOULD HELP
CONSISTENT CONNECTION USING BLUETOOTH WITH MY PHONE SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE TO SHUT OFF THE VEHICLE IN ORDER FOR IT TO RECOGNIZE THE INTERNET AND USE PANDORA VERY FRUSTRATING
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY PLACEMENT OF THE USB AND AUX PORTS
COULD BE FASTER WITH VOICE RECOGNITION RESPONSE BACK
THE MULTIPLE FAVORITES MENUS ARE HARD TO GET TO ON THE SCREEN YOU HAVE TO SWIPE AT JUST THE RIGHT POINT ON THE SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION IS HORRIBLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SOMETIMES HAS A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING NEARBY POIS
THE NAVIGATION DOESN T RESPOND AND DOES NOT LOCATE ADDRESSES
ABILITY TO MAKE CALLS USING YOUR VEHICLE CELLULAR PLAN
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC VIA A MEMORY CARD I M OBVIOUSLY DOING SOMETHING WRONG BUT IT SHOULD BE EASIER
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE TURN BY TURN FEATURE
OFFER A CD
THE ODD DELAY BETWEEN IPOD TRACKS AND THE CONSTANT NEED TO RELOAD TRACK NAMES PHONE NUMBERS ETC FROM EXTERNAL DEVICES
DEFINE WHAT SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE THAT I DON T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH AND HAVE NO NEED FOR FOR EXAMPLE DOES NAVIGATION CAPABILITY EXIST OR NOT VERBAL ONSCREEN TEMPORARILY AVAILABLE PERMANENTLY AVAILABLE VAGUE AND CONFLICTING DESCRI
BLUETOOTH USB CONNECTIVITY MY IPOD AND IPHONE CAN CONNECT MAYBE 1 OUT OF 3 TRIES
THE ONE THING THAT BOTHERS ME MOST IS THAT THERE WAS NO CD PLAYER ALSO THE SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM AS GOOD AS THE ONE IN THE COLORADO IT SEEMS PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING UNDERSTANDING ME WHEN I USE BLUETOOTH THE SYSTEM DOESN T SEE
THE AUDIO VOICE COMMANDS NEEDS A SIMPLE VOCABULARY UNDER STAND WHAT CANCEL MEANS
I STILL HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET VOICE COMMAND TO WORK WITH MY IPHONE 6 PLUS
USB IF USB ITEMS ARE GOING TO BREAK THE SYSTEM THEN DON T CALL IT USB COMPATIBLE BECAUSE IT IS NOT IF A USB ITEM DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY THAT IS ONE THING BUT FOR A USB ITEM TO BREAK THE SYSTEM IS UNACCEPTABLE
SHOULD HAVE CD PLAYER AND HOME LINK THIS IS NOT OFFERED
MY CORVETTE IS A MY FAMILY HAS AND FORD VEHICLES WITH MUCH FRIENDLIER TO USE SYSTEMS VOICE RECOGNITION REACTS MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND ACCURATELY IN THE FORDS MAYBE CHEVROLET COULD REVIEW THE FORD SYSTEMS TO SEE WHAT I MEAN TH
EASIER CONNECTIVITY OF INTERNET MEDIA
WOULD LIKE TO SEE EASIER AUDIBLE TEXTING AND RECEIVING TEXTS
HANDS FREE PHONE PEOPLE SAY THEY CAN T HEAR ME
CAR SHOULD COME WITH A CD PLAYER
SOUND QUALITY BETTER
I DON T USE THE VOICE CONTROLS MUCH BECAUSE I HAVE TO GO THROUGH SO MUCH CRAP TO DO WHAT I WANT IS SHOULD BE ABLE TO PUSH THE BUTTON AND SAY CALL CLAIRE BUT IT S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT
THE LOOK OF THE INFOTAINMENT CENTER IS A LITTLE LACKING THE LOOK AND FEEL OF MY CAMARO S INFOTAINMENT CENTER WAS A LOT SLEEKER AND MORE RESPONSIVE AND THATS ODD CONSIDERING THEY RE BOTH CHRYSLER S
BOTTOM OF TOUCH SCREEN AWKWARD TO REACH
DIFFICULTY WORKING WITH ON STAR AND VOICE RECOGNITION CALLING WRONG CONTACT
THE CAR SHOULD HAVE LANE CHANGE NOTICE AND AUTO STOPPING AND BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEMS
I DIDN T WANT AN ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM I JUST WANT A GOOD STEREO SYSTEM WITH CD PLAYER BUT IT IS NOT AVAILABLE
A CENTRAL COMMAND KNOB WOULD BE NICE SOMETHING LIKE THE BMW IDRIVE SYSTEM AS THE TOUCH SCREEN IS TOO DISTRACTING TO USE SAFELY WHILE DRIVING
I HAVE FOUND THAT ALL VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY LAGS BEHIND THE TECHNOLOGY IN YOUR MOBILE PHONE IT S GREAT FOR A FEW WEEKS BUT THEN I END UP GOING BACK TO JUST USING MY PHONE MY IPHONE IS A BETTER NAVIGATION TOOL A BETTER TEXT MESSAGER ETC THAN THE
PANDORA RADIO IS SPOTTY AT BEST I AM CONSTANTLY HAVE TO KILL THE PROCESS ON THE TRUCK SYSTEM FOLLOWED BY KILLING AND RESTARTING PANDORA ON MY PHONE THEN RESYNCING TO THE TRUCK AUDIO
WHEN CONNECTING A PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH THERE SHOULD BE MORE OPTIONS THAN JUST MAKING AND RECEIVING PHONE CALLS LIKE PLAYING MUSIC
DOESN T DISPLAY THE ARTIST SONG THAT IS PLAYING ON THE RADIO ONLY WILL IF ON SATELLITE RADIO
STORING OF WIFI INFO ON BOARD IT SEEMS TO LOSE DATA WHEN SOFTWARE GETS AN UPDATE PUT INFO IN A SECURE FILE IN THE UNIT
I HAVE A FULLY LOADED LTZ BUT NO PIONEER SYSTEM WHICH ALL TOP MODELS SHOULD HAVE THIS IS THE ONLY THING MISSING
BACK UP CAMERA SHOULD COME ON WHEN RIGHT DIRECTIONAL IS IN USE TO HELP WITH LANE CHANGES THIS FEATURE IS IN THE HONDA ACCORD
IT WOULD BE NICE TO TURN THE RADIO OFF FROM THE STEERING WHEEL I CAN ANSWER MY PHONE CHANGE THE VOLUME OF THE PHONE OR RADIO BUT IF I WANT TO CHANGE STATIONS OR TURN THE RADIO OFF ON I MUST DO THAT FROM THE RADIO ITSELF
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING THE ONE TIME I USED THE ON STAR SYSTEM I DID NOT LIKE THE WAY IT WORKED COMPARED TO MY TOMTOM GPS FROM A PREVIOUS VECHICLE
PANDORA IS WONDERFUL TO HAVE IN THE CAR DO NOT NEED CDS ANYMORE
NAVIGATION IS THROUGH ONSTAR WOULD PREFER A ACTIVE GPS WITHOUT HAVING TO PHONE A FRIEND
WELL WHEN I FIRST GOT MY CAR THE ONSTAR MODULE WENT BAD AND I HAD TO WAIT FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS TO GET A NEW ONE INSTALLED
CANNOT CONNECT BY BLUETOOTH TO MY IPHONE YOU HAVE TO PLUG IT IN ANDROID DOES NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE NAV SYSTEM VOICE COMMANDS DO NOT WORK VERY WELL THEN YOU HAVE TO PULL OVER TO MANUALLY PUT IN THE ADDRESS TAKES A LONG TIME TO TYPING IN ADDRESSES
THE BROWSE SCREEN FOR THE SATELLITE RADIO TOUCH SCREEN FINGER SCROLL UP AND DOWN IS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE
THE 4 DISPLAY IS GOOD AND OFFERS WHAT I NEED HAVING THE 8 SCREEN AS AN AFFORDABLE OPTION WOULD HAVE BEEN PREFERRED
USB CONNECTIVITY USING AN IPOD DEVICE IS TERRIBLE IT S SO BAD I WOULD NEVER CONSIDER A GM PRODUCT AGAIN AMERICA IS CAR CULTURE AND CARS AND TUNES GO TOGETHER EVEN MORE SO WITH A CORVETTE MY IPOD USB CONNECTIVITY ISSUES HAVE REALLY SPOILED
I HAVE ENJOYED BEING ABLE TO DRIVE NORMALLY AND TALK ON THE PHONE THROUGH MY BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY
I D LIKE A MORE POWERFUL SOUND SYSTEM 250 WATTS JUST ISN T ENOUGH
LARGER IN COLOR DISPLAY WITH TOUCH FEATURES
I CAN HEAR PEOPLE FINE WHEN USING HANDS FREE PHONE HOWEVER OFTEN THEY CAN T HEAR ME I FEEL I HAVE TO LOOK UP ABIT TO TALK INTO THE MICROPHONE AREA TO BE HEARD I AM SHORT LEGGED AND I TEND TO SIT VERY CLOSE TO THE FRONT AND MY VOICE IS NOT EA
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS DOWNRIGHT UGLY
VOICE RECOGNITION REQUIRES RADIO TO BE ON THEN MUST WAIT FOR BEEP BEFORE GIVING A COMMAND RATES BELOW FORD SYNC SYSTEM ONSTAR SYSTEM TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE CASUAL USER
THE RADIO STATION DISPLAY SETUP IS POOR COMPARED OTHER CAR MODELS NEEDS BETTER LAYOUT
VOICE COMMANDS ARE MISUNDERSTOOD OFTEN NOT PICKING UP EVERYTHING I STATE
A MORE REASONABLY PRICED BOSE SYSTEM
SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT I DON T USE LIKE WI FI I AM DRIVING I DON T NEED MY CAR TO BE A HOT SPOT SATELLITE RADIO IS A WASTE FOR ME SINCE I DON T TRAVEL LONG MILES ON A REGULAR BASIS THE HANDS FREE WORKED WHEN I GOT THE C
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY COULD START AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT HESITATION OR DELAY
I WOULD RATHER THE SYSTEM NOT START AUTOMATICALLY IT STARTLES ME TO HAVE MY IPOD BEGIN PLAYING AS I M BACKING OUT OF MY GARAGE I AM CAPABLE OF TURNING THINGS ON WHEN I WANT THEM ON
VOICE RECOGNITION OPTIONS TO TRAVEL POINTS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE DIRECTIONS PRIOR TO DRIVING OFF
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THERE WAS A PHYSICAL � NOT TOUCH SCREEN � PLAY PAUSE BUTTON FOR IPODS SD CARDS ETC
I HAVE ONLY USED FM RADIO AND SATELLITE RADIO VOICE COMMAND HAD WORKED FINE WITH SATELLITE TO CHANGE STATIONS HAVEN T TRIED YET WITH FM AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE AUDIO CONTROLS OR CHANGING STATIONS ARE A GUESS TO USE BEHIND STEERING WHEEL CON
MAKE THE AUDIO TOUCH SCREEN AN OPTIONAL CHOICE
AS STATED BEFORE THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH VOICE TEXTING
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T ALWAYS WORK PROPERLY
THE BASIC SPEAKERS ARE OF RELATIVELY BELOW AVERAGE SOUND QUALITY
FM RADIO RECEPTION
I DO NOT USE MY CELL PHONE WHILE DRIVING I DO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND FIND THAT I USE THE BUTTONS RATHER THAN THE TOUCH SCREEN BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT I AM USED TO I HOPE TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR LONGER TRIPS
CAN NOT READ SMALL PRINT ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN
GOOD EXCEPT FOR BLUETOOTH ISSUES
I THINK THE BLUTOOTH SPEAKER STRENGTH COULD BE IMPROVED I DO NOT LIKE HOW THE CAR GIVES ME ALERTS FOR UPCOMING ROAD CONDITIONS THAT I CAN T SEEM TO FIND A WAY TO TURN OFF FOR EXAMPLE TOLL BOOTH AHEAD SOMETIMES I FIND THE TOUCHSCREEN A LIT
IT WOULD HE HELPFUL FOR THE SYSTEM TO DISPLAY THE SPEED LIMIT ON THE SCREEN LIKE THE GARMIN GPS S
THE RADIO SATELLITE RADIO AND USC FOR IPOD IS GREAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GET TO KNOW HOW TO USE
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM I USE A SMART PHONE AND AN IPOD AND ON OCCASION HAVE HAD MUSIC PLAYING FROM THE IPHONE EVEN THOUGH I VE DONE NOTHING TO CAUSE THAT THE DIRECTIONS THAT COME WITH THE CAR ARE OF NO
I HAVE ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR 3 MONTHS AND HAVE HAD NO NEED TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE ONLY AUDIO I HAVE USED IS THE RADIO WHICH IS TUNED TO SATELLITE RADIO ALL THE TIME I HAVE NOT USED THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AS I HAVE NO NEED FOR IT RIGHT
SPEAKERS ARE BELOW AVERAGE DONT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN TO DISTRACTING TO USE WHILE DRIVING
THE TRAFFIC INFORMATION DOES NOT APPEAR FOR ALL MAJOR ROADS FOR EXAMPLE TRAFFIC IS SHOWN FOR I80 IN NJ BUT NOT FOR I287 PORTIONS OF THE NJ TURNPIKE ALSO DO NOT APPEAR
THE STEERING WHEEL KNOB FOR THE RADIO CONTROLS IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO USE IT EITHER DOESN T SENSE ME TRYING TO SWITCH IT OR MY FINGER SLIPS OFF OF IT HALF THE TIME I GIVE UP AND USE THE DIALS ON THE RADIO WHICH IS KIND OF A REACH FOR ME
I MAY BE MY PHONE BUT I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONNECT MY PHONE TO THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM
ONCE AGAIN IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO HAVE THE TOUCH SCREEN INSTEAD OF HAVING TO GO THROUGH ALL THOSE BUTTONS
LARGER CONTROL BUTTONS TOUCH SCREEN ON NAVIGATION
I WOULD LIKE IT TO DO A BETTER JOB OF VOICE RECOGNITION
AUDIO COMMAND NEVER UNDERSTANDS ME THE DISPLAY SCREEN OFTEN DIMS WITHOUT WARNING EVEN WHEN THE LIGHT IS CONSTANT
CUE IS THE MOST DIFFICULT SYSTEM I VE EVER ENCOUNTERED MAYBE AS TIME GOES ON AND I CAN REFERENCE THE OWNER S MANUAL WITHOUT FALLING ASLEEP IT LL COME MORE NATURALLY BUT RIGHT NOW I STICK TO USING THE CD PLAYER AND A FEW OF THE PRESET RADIO STA
AS STRANGE AS IT MIGHT SEEM TO YOU SOME OF US DO NOT HAVE I PHONES OR OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES NO NEED FOR ON STAR OR SIRUS RADIO OR OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES AM FM RADIO IS ALL THE DISTRACTION I NEED
THE CUE SCREEN SLIDE BAR FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK THE BEST OR I AM NOT USING IT PROPERLY
DON T KNOW HOW TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NO ONE AT THE DEALERSHIP SHOWED ME HOW TO USE IT ONLY SHOWED ME THE RADIO
SOMEONE THAT UNDERSTANDS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE
PEOPLE ON THE RECEIVING END OF PHONE CALLS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THEY DO NOT LIKE THE SOUND FROM MY END WHEN USING HANDS FREE CALLING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT EASY TO USE INSTEAD I USE THE BLUE STAR WHERE I JUST PRESS A BUTTON AND VERBALLY GIVE AN ADDRESS AND THEY DOWNLOAD IT TO THE SCREEN IN SECONDS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM FREQUENTLY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE COMMANDS
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND FOR MY PHONE I WILL GET THIS LOOKED INTO SOON
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE AND SOUND FOR STANDARD SPEAKERS COULD USE IMPROVEMENT
MY ONLY NEGATIVE IS THAT I AM TOLD THAT MY BLUETOOTH SOUND IS NOT AS GOOD AS ON MY PREVIOUS BUICK IT APPARENTLY IS NOT A CLEAR VOICE THEY ARE HEARING SAY IT SOUNDS LIKE I AM UNDER WATER
NAVIGATION IN VEHICLE IS HARD TO USE HARD TO COMMUNICATE WITH IT
DASHBOARD CUE SCREEN A LITTLE BIT TOO CROWDED FOR ME BUT MAYBE IT IS A GENERATIONAL ISSUE
WITHOUT A TOUCH SCREEN USING THE KNOW TO TYPE IN AN ADDRESS IS TERRIBLE MUST HAVE TOUCH SCREEN
SIRIUX OR WHATEVER THE NAME OF THE COMPANY THAT COMES WITH THE CAR SHOULD BE OPTIONAL I DON T CARE THAT IS FREE I THINK IT IS ANNOYING THAT YOU HAVE TO RECEIVE CALLS CONSTANTLY FROM THIS COMPANY REGARDING A SUBSCRIPTION WHEN I DID NOT WANTED IT
MORE INTUITIVE CONTROLS ON CUE SYSTEM AND BETTER CONNECTIVITY WITH APPLE PRODUCTS INCLUDING CHARGING MAT
HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO GET THE CAR TO READ MY TEXTS OR LET ME SEND TEXTS EVEN THOUGH THE DEALERSHIP SET IT UP FOR ME I ALSO HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO RUN THE TEXT ALERTS THROUGH THE CAR SO IF ONE COMES IN WHILE I AM DRIVING I NEVER HEAR IT WHEN I CH
FIX THE CUE
I MISS HAVING AT LEAST ONE KNOB FOR VOLUME CHANNEL SELECTION THE TOUCH AND HOLD NATURE OF BUTTONS OR TOUCHSCREEN TO CHANGE THESE THINGS IS OFTEN TOO SLOW FOR MY TASTE
DROPS IPHONE AT LEAST ONCE A MONTH AND THIS IS AGGRAVATING
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN USING MEDIA COMMANDS
I VE HAD TO HAVE IT REPLACED AND IT IS SLOW AND DOESN T INTERACT WELL WITH MY IPOD
I WISH THAT THE TOUCH SCREEN DID NOT GET SOILED SO EASILY FINGER PRINTS AND DUST
VOICE RECOGNITION I JUST GAVE UP USING FOR NAV AND AUDIO OR CLIMATE
NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION AS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY
TOO MUCH TECHNOLOGY HORIZONTAL SOUND VOLUME BAR IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL
TOO HARD TO USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
ALLOWING FOR VOICE CONTROL OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE DRIVER IS DRIVING IN CAR ALONE KEEP THE LAWYERS OUT OF IT
VOICE RECOGNITION SOMETIMES UNRELIABLE
CUE SYSTEM HAS SOME RESPONSE DELAY MORE PROCESSING POWER COULD HELP
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I AM NOT LOVING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I THINK THE MAP IS NOT SO CLEAR AND I WISH THERE WERE A WAY TO QUICKLY SEE WHAT STREET I WAS ACTUALLY DRIVING ON AS OPPOSED TO PERPENDICULAR STREETS OUR OLD ESCALADE HAD I THINK A
I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT NOT ONLY DIDN T HAVE A CD PLAYER NEVER DISCLOSED UNTIL DELIVERY BUT THAT I HAD LOST THE FUNCTION TO STORE MUSIC RECORD CD S
I NEED MORE TRAINING I WOULD HAVE LIKED A CD PLAYER
WHILE CADILLAC FINALLY GOT THE QUERTY KEYBOARD ON THE NAV SYSTEM THE SYSTEM JUST SEEMS MORE DIFFICULT TO USE OVERALL TOO MANY SCREENS NEEDED TO GET IT DONE NOT INTUITIVE ON HOW TO USE TO MANEUVER BETWEEN SCREENS OR WHERE TO GO TO CHANGE VOLUM
IT D BE A 10 EXCEPT FOR THE CUE SYSTEM
USE OF VOICE COMMAND FOR NAVIGATING MUSIC SOURCES CALLING HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC FOR ME I PROBABLY JUST NEED MORE EXPERIENCE THE TOUCH CONTROLS WORK FINE SO I RELY ON THEM
WITH NO TOUCH SCREEN IT IS SLOW TO ENTER ADDRESS INFORMATION ETC FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO TURN THE KNOB TO EACH LETTER AND PUSH THE KNOB TO ENTER IT TEST DRIVING AND LOOKING AT THE CAR I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TOUCH SCREEN ALSO FOR
USING THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR DETAIL LIST WHEN FREEWAY DRIVING IS DIFFICULT DUE TO BOUNCY RIDE
SOMETIMES WHILE I M LISTENING TO THE RADIO THE SONG TITLE AND ARTIST WILL DISPLAY ON THE SCREEN IT S ODD BECAUSE AT TIMES IT LL BE THE WRONG SONG AND IN MOST CASES A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT GENRE A SECOND THING MY RADIO GIVES ME A FEW DIFFERENT P
WHEN USING THE VOLUME CONTROLS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IT BLACKS OUT THE WHOLE SCREEN IT S NOT A HUGE ISSUE BUT FOR SOME REASON I D RATHER IT NOT BLACK OUT THE SCREEN WHEN ADJUSTING VOLUME
LOSE THE USB AND GIVE BACK TO CD PLAYER TOO MUCH BASS SPEAKERS SOUND HOLLOW WE ALL DON T LISTEN TO HOP HOP AND HAVE GRILLS FOR TEETH
NEEDS BETTER VOICE CONTROL MFG HAS TWO LEVELS OF MYLINK RADIO LG LOWER END AND PANSONIC HIGHER END WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY WERE THE SAME FOR ALL THEIR VEHICLES AS WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE LESSER CAPABILITIES OF THE LG RADIO
THE ON OFF BUTTON FOR THE MYLINK ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS NOT IMMEDIATELY RESPONSIVE AND DOESN T PROVIDE ANY TACTILE FEEDBACK WHEN YOU PRESS IT VOLUME CONTROLS ALSO COULD BE MORE RESPONSIVE AND EVEN BETTER AUDIO BETTER BASS MORE OF A SURROUND S
WISH THERE WAS A CD PLAYER
I WISH IN MY VEHICLE I COULD CONNECT BY BLUETOOTH FOR MY MUSIC PLAY FROM PHONE
IT SOUNDS MUFFLED WHEN COMING FROM MY IPHONE
I USE AN ANDROID SMART PHONE WHICH IS NOT COMPATIBLE WHEN CONNECTING VIA USB THIS IS A PRETTY BIG DEAL TO ME
I DON T LIKE THE ONSTAR BUTTONS ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I ACCIDENTALLY TOUCH THEM WHEN FIXING THE MIRROR
THE RADIO PRESETS ALSO A MORE INTUITIVE FUNCTION FOR TURNING THE RADIO ON AND OFF WHILE KEEPING THE OTHER DISPLAYS ON THE LITTLE CONSOLE SCREEN I E THE FLOW OF ELECTRICITY
THE USB CONNECTION IS NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE SOMETIMES THE SYSTEM DOESN T RECOGNIZE MY IPOD IS CONNECTED THROUGH THE USB AND I M FORCED TO USE THE AUX CONNECTOR MY USB CORD IS NOT DAMAGED AND HAS BEEN PLUGGED INTO THE USB PORT SECURELY ALSO ALLOW
THE ABILITY OF THE VEHICLE S SYSTEM TO MAKE DRIVING TOTALLY HANDS FREE
I WOULD PREFER A NAVIGATION SYSTEM DISPLAY MAPS
BUILT IN NAVIGATION NOT AN APP
I HAVE A BASE MODEL AND ALL THERE IS TO PLAY MUSIC IS AN AUX CABLE I WOULD HAVE LIKED A CD PLAYER
BASIC AM FM RADIO NO CD PLAYER NO USB PORT AND PORTABLE CD PLAYERS OBSOLETE
I DO NOT LISTEN TO THE RADIO AND THIS MODEL ONLY HAS AM FM RADIO I DO LISTEN TO SIRIUS IN MY EQUINOX 2LT BUT DISLIKE THE MUSIC ON THE RADIO SO I JUST DON T LISTEN I CAN T COMMENT ON THE QUALITY SINCE I DON T USE IT
ADDIND A CD PLAYER MEAYBE A COUPLE OF USB OR ANOTHER AUX CABLE
I HAD ONSTAR IN SEVERAL PREVIOUS LUXURY VEHICLES AND HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED IN IT I HAVE NOT ACTIVATED THE ONSTAR FOR THAT REASON AND MY CELL PHONE HAS GOOD APPS I AM 66 AND WILL GET ASSISTANCE FROM THE DEALER IN CONNECTING TO BLUETOOTH WHEN I G
PLACEMENT OF THE MICROPHONE IF I TURN MY HEAD WHILE SPEAKING IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE LISTENER TO DISCERN WHAT I HAVE SAID
NOT A FAN OF USING TOUCHSCREEN FOR CHANNELING MUSIC STASTIONS
BLUETOOTH PHONE QUALITY ESPECIALLY WHEN TALKING TO ONSTAR
SINCE CAR IS ONLY 4 MONTHS OLD I HAVE NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SEVERAL OF THE OPTIONS I DID NOT TRAVEL IN THE FIRST 3 MONTHS SO ON STAR WAS NOT USED I DO NOT USE THE HANDS FREE PHONE APPLICATION I LOVE SIRIUS XM RADIO BUT WISH THE RULES FOR IT
TOUCHSCREEN OPERATION IS NOT USEFUL AS IT REQUIRES A DISTRACTED DRIVING SITUATION CREATED BY THE MANUFACTURER ELIMINATE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS
HANDS FREE USE OF MY CELL PHONE
THE FACT THAT THE VOICE CONTROL LINKS DIRECTLY TO SIRI ON MY IPHONE IS GREAT BUT THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTROL ANYTHING NOT PHONE BASED ALSO THE CENTER INFO SCREEN NEEDS A BIT OF RE THINKING LIKE IT NEEDS TO RETURN TO RADIO DISPLAY AFTER USING PHO
I STILL HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS IT S NEVER BEEN OPERATIONAL YOU COULD TEST THE SYSTEMS BEFORE YOU SELL THE CARS AND MAKE SURE THE INTERNET HOT SPOT AND NAVIGATION ARE WORKING I DON T THINK THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TO ASK
BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE WIFI CONNECTIVITY
FOR SOMEONE NEW TO ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY IN A VEHICLE IT IS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING AND CONFUSING
NEEDS A CD STANDARD
TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVITY AND SCROLL NEEDS IMPROVEMENT HARD TO CHANGE SCREENS VIA SWIPING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT OFTEN RECOGNIZE ENTRIES ALTHOUGH IT IS A NEW CAR AND SHOULD HAVE THIS DATA
BETTER QUALITY SPEAKERS CURRENT SPEAKERS HAVE VERY LITTLE BASS THERE IS NO ENCLOSURE FOR THE REAR SPEAKERS STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE NOT ERGONOMIC I HAVE TO READJUST MY HAND TO REACH THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE ON THE STEERING WHEEL
MAKE NAVIGATION STANDARD AND NOT PART OF THE LUXURY PACKAGE
I WISH THE SPARK HAD APPLE CAR PLAY SO IT COULD FUNCTION WITH MY CAR MUCH BETTER AND HAVE ACCESS TO MY APPS LIKE GOOGLE MAPS AND BE ABLE TO COMPOSE TEXT MESSAGES BY VOICE
EASE OF USE WHEN GIVING VOICE COMMANDS
EASIERFOR PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT TECH SAVY
IT IS A VERY BASIC SYSTEM THERE IS ON STAR IN THE CAR BUT I WOULD RATHER HAVE A SIMPLE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR MY CELL PHONE RATHER THAN ONSTARS EXPENSIVE PHONE SERVICE TAKE OUT ON STAR AND INSTALL A BETTER AUDO SYSTEM WITH BLUETOOTH
COULD ATLEAST HAVE A CD PLAYER
BETTER WAY TO SHUFFLE THROUGH FAVORITES ON THE RADIO
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN I SAY CALL PERSON S NAME HAS BEEN AWFUL NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS MY SONIC
I AVOID USING THE TOUCH SCREEN WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE IT IS A BIG DISTRACTION
DEALER INSTALLED REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS NOT A BLU RAY HOWEVER THE PRICE WAS THAT OF TOP OF THE LINE PRODUCT
USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO MAKE A CALL NEVER WORKS
RADIO OPERATIONG SEPERATLY FROM NAVIGATION SYSTEM
DIFFICULT TO DRIVE AND USE THE SYSTEM BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE SCREEN IT CAUSES DRIVER TO REMOVE EYES FROM THE ROAD AND LOOK DOWN ALSO NAVIGATION IS TOO VAGUE
THE SOUND QUALITY OF PHONE CALLS THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH IS POOR
SYNCRONIZATION OF PHONE S MEMORIZED PHONE NUMBER DATABASE WITH THE VOICE CONTROL SYSTEM I CAN T SEEM TO REQUEST A CALL OF A PERSON BY NAME
THE MAP IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE NORTH IS USUALLY STRAIGHT UP AND IT IS NOT ON THE MAP
ALREADY INDICATED HOW THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T WORK
WE WERE TRULY DISAPPOINTED WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT OUR OLDER VEHICLE HAD BETTER AUDIO FEATURES THAN THE NEW CHEVY TRAVERSE THERE IS NO BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR THE PANDORA THAT WE LOVE TO LISTEN TO WE NOW DO NOT HAVE THAT FEATURE AT ALL
HAVE YET TO USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS USED RARELY AND COMMUNICATION PHONE IS USED LITTLE WHAT HAS BEEN USED SO FAR IS GOOD
MUST USE ONSTAR FOR NAVIGATION
TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE
THE WHOLE THING IS TEMPERAMENTAL IN REGARDS TO BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
THE ONE ASPECT OF MY NEW VEHICLE S AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS THAT COULD BE IMPROVED THE MOST IS THE SOUND QUALITY
VOICE RECOGNITION TO DIAL NUMBERS IS A HIT AND MISS EXPERIENCE THE AUDIO SOUND IS MEDIOCRE FOR A BOSE SYSTEM
VOICE COMMAND IS HARD TO USE AND NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PHONE CALLS
THERE ARE SEVEN PRESET SCREENS FOR RADIO STATIONS IT IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN THEM WHILE DRIVING THE ON WHEEL CONTROLS ALLOWS YOU TO GO THRU THESE 7 SCREENS ONE STATION AT AT TIME BUT DOES NOT HAVE A SEARCH FEATURE SUCH AS THE ONE ON THE
THERE IS NO BUTTON TO GET DIRECTLY TO THE NOW PLAYING MUSIC YOU HAVE TO NAVIGATE TO THE HOME MENU THEN TO NOW PLAYING THIS IS QUITE ANNOYING
NAVIGATION VOICE COMMANDS GOOGLE IS SO MUCH BETTER
CONTROLLING IPOD VIA VEHICLE CONTROLS IS VERY CUMBERSOME IN TERMS OF SONG ARTIST SELECTION ALSO IF I PLUG MY PHONE IN TO CHARGE THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY STARTS PLAYING RANDOM MUSIC TRACKS STORED ON THE PHONE LAST COMPLAINT IS AGAIN THE STEER
EASE OF ACCESS WHILE DRIVING HAVE NOT USED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PHONE IS TERRIBLE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOES NOT EVER UNDERSTAND WHAT I WANT EVEN WITH THE SIMPLEST OF COMMANDS SUCH AS CALL HOME
VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR SO I DON T USE IT
A SINGLE DISC CD PLAYER SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED
THE OWNERS MANUAL SUPPLEMENT STATES THAT VOICE COMMANDS CAN BE USED WITH THE AUDIO SYSTEM TO CHANGE A SOURCE STATION ETC HOWEVER CHEVROLET ADVISES THAT THE TRAX DOES NOT INCLUDE VOICE COMMANDS FOR AUDIO FOR THE PHONE ONLY I BELIEVE THE T
IT IS EASY TO CHANGE THE VOLUME ON THE RADIO AND I DON T USE ANY OF THE OTHER AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS I AM DRIVING AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE DANGEROUS DUE TO DISTRACTION
I ONLY PLAY MUSIC FROM APP BASED STREAMING PLAYLISTS I HAVE TO USE THE AUX JACK TO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC SINCE THERE S NO FILES ACTUALLY STORED IN THE PHONE BUT IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO JUST CONNECT THE USB STOW MY PHONE IN THE CENTER CONSOLE T
EASE OF USE FOR SELECTING RADIO CHANNELS HAVE TO NAVIGATE SEVERAL SCREENS TO CHANGE CHANNELS IN GENERAL THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT WELL DESIGNED FOR EASE OF USE AS SOME BUTTONS ARE LOCATED AT THE BOTTOM EDGE AND REQUIRE SQUEEZING YOUR FINGER I
THE MENUS HAVE TOO MANY STEPS AND TOO MANY FEATURES HAVE TO BE ACCESSED THROUGH THE TOUCH SCREEN AND NOT THROUGH PHYSICAL CONTROLS
BE LIKE APPLE AND LINK THE CAR WITH THE PHONE SAME INFO ON ALL SAME WAY TO DO IT ON ALL DEVICES IN AND OUT OF CAR
THE NAG SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND ACCESS I USE MY IPHONE WITH THE BLUETOOTH BECAUSE IT S SO MUCH EASIER AND HAS CLEARER DIRECTIONS
BUTTONS ARE NOT WELL LAID OUT ON DASH AND TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE NEEDS RETHINKING
THE UCONNECT APP REQUIRED FOR USING IN CAR APPS IS JUNK I ONLY SUCCESSFULLY USED IT THREE TIMES MOST OF THE TIME IT WOULD CAUSE MY SMARTPHONE NOT TO BE DETECTED AFTER I UNINSTALLED UCONNECT FROM MY PHONE IT EASILY CONNECTS AS A BLUETOOTH MEDIA
IPOD CONNECTION IS SOMETIMES ERRATIC NOT SURE IF IT IS MY IPOD OR THE CAR
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE INCLUDED AT PRICE POINT THAT BEING SAID IF IT WAS CLOSER TO $250 00 WE WOULD CONSIDER ITS A SOUR TAKEAWAY FOR US WILL USE THE PHONE INSTEAD
NAVIGATION SYSTEM MORE LIKE GARMIN
IT WOULD BE NICE TO USE THE NAVIGATION WHILE CAR IS MOVING I DRIVE WHEN WE ARE GO TRIPS AND MY WIFE EVEN IN THE PASSENGER SEAT CANT US THE NAVIGATION UNLESS IN PARK
I DID NOT GET NAVIGATION OR UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM SO SOUND IS A LITTLE MUFFLED
NOT SURE IF THERE S A PLACE LATER TO COMMENT OR IF THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE BUT THE ONSTAR SYSTEM HAS NOT WORKED SINCE DAY 3 OF PURCHASE AND THE REPLACEMENT PART IS STILL NOT AVAILABLE 3+ MONTHS LATER THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHY I VE RATED THE S
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM STOPS IF YOU GO OFF COURSE AND YOU HAVE TO RE ENTER INFORMATION THIS IS A TERRIBLE FEATURE
NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION HAS A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING STREET AND CITY NAMES
TOUCH SCREEN NAVIGATION WOULD BE AMAZING BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE SCREEN LIKE YOU DO AN IPHONE
AUTOMATIC CONNECTIVITY TO THE PHONE INSIDE THE CAR
THE VOLUME IS NOT LOUD EVEN WHEN IT IS ON MAX BOSE SOUND SYSTEM IS MUCH BETTER
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SUCKS I AM TOTALLY DISGUSTED THAT THEY USE SUCH AN OUTDATED MAP I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PURCHASE AN UPDATED MAP FOR A BRAND NEW VEHICLE
I FEEL THAT THE PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM COULD BE BETTER
I WISH A NAVIGATION SYSTEM WAS OFFERED ON MY VEHICLE
USB AND EXTERNAL AUDIO PLUG IN CLOSING COMPARTMENT ABOVE GLOVE BOX COULD HAVE A HOLE PORT SO A DEVICE CAN BE PLUGGED IN AND STILL EASILY SHUT THE COMPARTMENT
MAKE THE NAV SYSTEM MORE LIKE TOYOTAS SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENTER DESTINATIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO GO CITY FIRST AND THE MAP NEEDS TO GIVE BETTER DIRECTIONS IT OFTEN TELLS ME TO TAKE AN EXIT FOR A HIGHWAY WITHOUT TELLING ME NORTH SOUTH OR EAST WEST
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE SLOW AND CAN ONLY BE USED WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED FRUSTRATING FOR THE PASSENGER WHO COULD USE IT WHEN MOVING I USE MY GOOGLE MAPS ON MY SMARTPHONE AS IT IS A BETTER SYSTEM DON T USE ON STAR AS THAT
EASIER NAVIGATION SYSTEM
BLUETOOTH SELDOM UNDERSTANDS MY VOICE DIALING REQUESTS
WISH I HAD A NAVIGATION SYSTEM
IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAIR MY PHONE TO THE BLUETOOTH
CANNOT CONNECT TO YOU UCONNECT BECAUSE OUR RADIO IS TOO NEW
I WISH IT HAD A CD PLAYER
STILL WISH I COULD LOAD CD S INTO A JUKEBOX SYSTEM LIKE FORD S
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT RECOGNIZE NAMES
WHAT I DON T LIKE IS THERE IS NO CD PLAYER OR SATELLITE I HAD TO BUY A SATELLITE SIRIUS XM RADIO FOR THE CAR
CAN NOT GET SIRI TO RESPOND PROPERLY
MANUAL USE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I HAVE HAD TO ALMOST SOLELY RELY ON DOWNLOADING DESTINATION INFO VIA THE MOBILE APP OR UTILIZE ONSTAR CONNECTED DESTINATION DOWNLOAD TO THE NAV SYSTEM AS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO SO MANUALLY AND HAVE NO
VOICE RECOGNITION RE PHONE USEAGE I MUST STATE THAT I M NOT SURE IF IT IS THE VEHICLE S COMMUNICATION SYSTEM OR MY OWN CELL PHONE I HAVE NOT INVESTIGATED IT AS YET BUT EXPECT TO RESOLVE AS MY STATE HAS PASSED LEGISLATION BANNING HAND HELD PHONE
ENDING A CALL WITH THE IPHONE DOES NOT ALWAYS HANG UP
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED AND SO DOES THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE PHONE AS LISTENERS COMPLAIN THAT WE ARE TALKING TO THEM FROM INSIDE A BOX
MAYBE A MORE DETAILED MAP ON NAV
COMPATIBILITY WITH POPULAR PRODUCTS LIKE IPHONES
THE USB MULTI MEDIA PLAYER FOLDER LIST IS IMPOSSIBLE TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING THE SOUND VOLUME IS TOO LOW WHILE USING THE BLUETOOTH UCONNECT
MY PARTICULAR MODEL HAS AN UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM THAT I PAID MORE FOR AND SUPPOSEDLY FEATURES INFINITY SPEAKERS PAST VEHICLES THAT I HAVE HAD WITH THIS AUDIO SYSTEM HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IN THIS PARTICULAR VEHICLE THE BASE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FAR S
SOUND QUALITY AND ADD GRAPHIC EQUALIZER
STILL CAN T BELIEVE IT DIDN T COME WITH A CD PLAYER I DOWNLOADED HUNDREDS OF SONGS ONTO MY ITUNES APP ON MY PHONE TO REPLICATE CDS AND I WILL SAY THAT THE SYNCH UP FEATURE WORKS QUITE WELL AND IF EVEN IF THERE ARE ONLY SIX SPEAKERS IN THE CAR
I NEVER USE ANY OF THIS I NEVER TURN ON THE RADIO NOR USE ANY OF THE CONNECTIVBITY CONTROLS AS I DO NOT HAVE A SMART PHONE NOR NEED BLUETOOTH I WANT TO HEAR TRAFFIC NOISES AND STAY ALERT
IT IS LIMITED ON VOICE COMMAND TEXT MESSAGING
CAN T READ THE DISPLAY IN SUNLIGHT I DON T USE BLUETOOTH WILL NOT KEEP SATELLITE RADIO HAVING ALL THAT IN THE CAR IS WORTHLESS TO ME
SOUND FOR HANDS FREE PHONE CONNECTION
ONLY HAVE RADIO AND CD PLAYER
AUXILIARY NEEDS TO BE FIXED
I BOUGHT SEPARATE SPEAKERS AND EQUALIZER TO HAVE A BETTER SOUND SYSTEM
I WISH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOADED FASTER
THE ONLY ODDITY IS THAT I CANNOT PLAY A YOUTUBE VIDEO AUDIO THROUGH THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY EVERY TIME I START A YOUTUBE OR EXTERNAL SOURCE VIDEO OUTSIDE OF PANDORA OR ITUNES IT CLICKS BACK OVER TO PANDORA OR ITUNES IT S VERY ODD THAT
ALL IS GREAT BUT THE SPEAKERS SOUND QUALITY IS HORRIBLE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS PRETTY BAD IN THIS CAR ESPECIALLY WHEN TRYING TO USE THE NAVIGATION ALSO I VE TRIED TO TYPE IN AN ADDRESS TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND IT EITHER DOESNT FIND IT OR WONT LET YOU TYPE THE CORRECT ADDRESS AS THE NUMBERS INACT
WISH IT HAD A CD PLAYER
WOULD LIKE THE TRAFFIC AND WEATHER OPTIONS ON RADIO NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE MORE DETAIL STREET NAMES SHOULD BE ON THE STREET DISPLAY OF MAP AND NOT LOCATED IN BUBBLES WITH A POINTER NEXT TO THE STREET DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND STREET NAME
$ 70 000 DOLLAR CAR DOES NOT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM UNLESS YOU PAY $600 DOLLARS EXTRA TO HAVE IT ACTIVATED MOST CARS WAY LESS THAN HALF OF THE PRICE WILL COME FROM THE FACTORY WITH BUILT IN NAVIGATION AT NO EXTRA COST
IMPAROVE VOICE RECOGNITION ALSO WHEN LOOKING UP A POI IT TAKES FOREVER TO FIND WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR AND I USUALLY RESORT TO FINDING IT ON MY I PHONE
BACK UP CAMERA QUALITY AT TIMES SEEMS GRAINY OR UNCLEAR MOSTLY AT NIGHT
CONNECT BETTER TO IPOD
NAVIGATION SYSTEM OFTEN REPORTS TRAFFIC DELAYS THAT ARE CLEARED BY THE TIME I REACH THEM
I WOULD SPEED UP THE RESPOSE TIME OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION SERVICE AND TAKE ALL THE STUPID BUTTONS AND PADDLES OFF OF THE STEERING WHEEL
NEEDS RICHER SOUND AND DEEPER BASS FOR SOMETHING LABELED ALPINE IT S SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTING THE STOCK STEREO AND SPEAKERS IN MY RAM 1500 EXPRESS SOUND SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IN COMPARISON IF THAT S THE BEST DODGE ALPINE CAN MANAGE THEN
GETTING LINKED TO MY IPOD CAN BE A LITTLE WONKY FROM TIME TO TIME
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY WHEN SEARCHING FOR SONGS USING VOICE COMMANDS FOR EXAMPLE BEING ABLE TO SAY ONE WORD IN THE TITLE RATHER THAN THE ENTIRE TITLE OR BEING ABLE TO PLAY THE ENTIRE ALBUM AFTER HEARING ONE SONG
USER INTERFACE IS HIDEOUS LOOK TO BOTH IOS OR ANDROID FOR INSPIRATION THE CURRENT UI LOOKS LIKE IT WAS BORROWED FROM A MICROWAVE
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE MORE ACCURATE
LOCATION OF THE USB PORT IS INSIDE THE CENTER CONSOLE WHICH REQUIRES CONNECTED DEVICE TO BE INSIDE CENTER CONSOLE INSTEAD OF AT HAND THIS SEEMS SILLY THE PORT SHOULD BE IN THE DASHBOARD OR ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE CENTER CONSOLE
WENT ON A TRIP AND ONSTAR DIDN T WORK AT ALL IT NEEDED A NEW SENDING UNIT
AUDIO SYSTEM NOT UNDERSTANDING COMMANDS
NOT HAVING TO USE ZIP CODE FOR NAVIGATION
BLUETOOTH MUSIC CONTROL THROUGH THE CONSOLE ISN T INTUITIVE IT S CUMBERSOME AND IT S JUST EASIER TO USE THE USB PORT TO CONTROL MUSIC
EASE OF USE OF USB PORT
FAVORITES SLIDE BAR AT BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SLIDE TO NEXT SET OF FAVORITES
DISAPPOINTED THAT NAVIGATION DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO DISPLAY A MAP VIEW
I USE SPOTIFY THROUGH MY PHONE TO LISTEN TO MUSIC AND SOMETIMES VEHICLES AUDIO SCREEN FREEZES UP MUSIC WILL PLAY PUT SONG TITLES WILL NOT ADVANCE ON DISPLAY SCREEN
A SUBWOOFER SHOULD COME WITH THE BOSE PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FINE AND I REALLY LIKE THE WIFI HOTSPOT FEATURE HOWEVER I USE MY SMART PHONE WITH A BLUETOOTH HEADSET FOR CALLS AND I ALSO USE MY SMARTPHONE S MAP NAVIGATION SYSTEM PRIMARILY BECAUSE I M USED TO IT
TEXTING VOICE RECOGNITION IS DIFFICULT OFTEN WILL SEND THE WRONG WORD SPOKEN
SYSTEM IS GREAT BUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS BELOW AVERAGE PREVIOUS IMPALA AND ACADIA HAVE BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A STEP BACKWARDS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS GM VEHICLES WE HAVE OWNED TURN AND ROUTE INFORMATION IS CONFUSING AND INADEQUATE EASE OF OPERATION IS POOR
NAVIGATION THE ONLY WAY TO GET NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS IS BY GOING THROUGH ONSTAR EVEN THEN WHEN THE DIRECTIONS ARE DOWNLOADED THERE IS NO OVERALL MAP TO SHOW YOU WHERE YOU ARE IN YOUR PROGRESS ALONG THE ROUTE ALL YOU GET IS TURN BY TURN DIRECTI
A BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE I DO HAVE ONE THROUGH ON STAR BUT IS HARD TO USE AND REQUIRES AN ADDITIONAL FEE
TAKES TOO LONG TO DIAL ONSTAR ESPECIALLY WHEN I BEEN REALLY LOST IVE BEEN DISCONNECTED TWICE WHILE GETTING DIRECTIONS NOT SOMTHING I WILL BE BUYING I WILL GO BY A NEW TOM TOM FOR MUCH LESS $
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD GIVE YOU A CHOICE IN WHICH ROUTE YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE HIGHWAY AS DIRECT ROUTE OR 2 LANE AS SENIC
WOULD LIKE TO BLUETOOTH APPLE DIRECTIONS DISPLAY TO MY VEHICLE SCREEN
NAVIGATION IS THE ONLY ISSUE HERE IT S NOT ACCURATE EFFICIENT
GREAT BLUETOOTH PHONE A BIT MIFFED WITH THE AUDIO OUTPUT AS FAR AS VOLUME
CANT MANIPULATE REAR DVD SCREEN FROM THE FRONT SEAT
WHEN CONNECTING TO PHONE HANDS FREE YOU CAN BARELY HEAR THE TONE OF THE PHONE CONNECTION FOR VOICE ACTIVATION OF CALLS OR OTHERWISE
IT S BETTER THAN NOTHING THE TOUCH SCREEN INTERFACE SUCKS
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAMES NEED TO BE BETTER
ALL STS NO TUTORIAL ON WIFI HOW TO SET CLOCK ALL FANCY SHIT IN CAR IAN 70 SALES PERSON DON T GIVE A SHIT IF I KNOE HOE TO USE FEATURE VERY DISAPPIONTED
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
I AM TOLD IT THAT IT CAN BE HARD TO HEAR ME OR THERE IS A LOT OF BACKGROUND NOISE WHEN MAKING HANDS FREE CALLS
THE ENTERTAINMENT SCREEN IN THE BACK FOR PLAYBACK OF DVDS
NAVIGATION HAS GLITCHES AND REVERSED COURSE ON ME MORE THAN Z FEW TIMES CAUSING LOST TIME AND WASTED MILES DRIVEN
SOUND QUALITY OF HANDS FREE SPEAKER MIROPHONE
XM RADIO HAS LIMITED BASS SOUND NAG SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE AN OPTION TO GET TO A DESTINATION USING A CERTAIN ROAD YOU DIRECT IT TO USE MANY TIME GPS SYSTEMS USE LEAST MILEAGE WHICH SOMETIMES IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT
POOR SOUND QUALITY TO ME AND OTHERS
RECOGNITION OF COMMAND WORDS TOO NARROW OFTEN MISUNDERSTANDS KEY PAD FOR TYPING IN DESIRED DESTINATIONS IS LOCKED OUT WHEN DRIVING I SUPPOSE IT S AN EFFORT TO AVOID DISTRACTIONS BUT A PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS
IMPROVE VOICE COMMANDS EASE OF USE
THE ONLY WAY TO SHUT OFF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS TO TURN THE VOLUME TO 0 IF THE SOUND IS MUTED IT UN MUTES ITSELF WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STARTED TURNING THE VOLUME TO 0 ALSO AFFECTS NAVIGATION AND THE BUILT IN PHONE SO I AM CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING THE VO
I HAVEN T USED THE VOICE ACTIVATED CONTROLS I M NOT MUCH INTO THAT
TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE APPLE IPHONE
SOUND QUALITY OF BLUETOOTH HAS ARTIFICIAL SOUND QUALITY
SOUND QUALITY ON THE HANDS FREE FREQUENTLY PEOPLE TELL ME I SOUND LIKE I AM IN A TUNNEL
I PURCHASED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR THE MODEL IT STUNK WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE UPDATED ONLY ONCE IN FOUR YEARS THAT WAS INCORRECT BUT THE UPDATING INTERVAL STILL WAS TOO LONG I NOW USE IPAD APS FOR NAVIGATION ON THE AND HAVE ABSOLU
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SAME AS MY RAM SHOULD BE UPDATED SOME NEW ROADS LIKE NEW AS OF 2 TO 4 YEARS AGO NOT ON THE SYSTEM
THE TOUCHSCREEN IS SOMETIMES SLOW TO RESPOND THERE IS NO POWER BUTTON FOR THE RADIO STEREO JUST A PAUSE AND MUTE
I DON T LIKE TO PAY FOR ALL THAT FANCY TECHNO NONSENSE THE PHONE BLUETOOTH IS A MUST FOR PHONE WHILE DRIVING AN SD CARD SLOT WOULD BE NICE I DON T WANT TO HAVE TO PAY FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL DO THINGS I DONT NEED IT TO DO OR WOULD BE TOO LAZY
INCLUDE AUDIO CONTROLS FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
UPDATE TO DO TEXT WITH IPHONE
THE SAME AS ANSWERED BEFORE I HAVE HAD DIFFICULTIES WITH THE PANDORA APP AND HAVE HAD TO STREAM PANDORA ON MY PHONE USING IT AS A MEDIA DEVICE CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH INSTEAD OF USING THE APP BECAUSE OF ISSUES WITH THE UCONNECT EVEN WHILE BOTH M
VERY DIFFICULT TO PLAY BLUETOOTH AUDIO HAVE TO PRESS MUTE & PLAY SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT WILL WORK
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE PLEASE JUST GET GOOGLE MAPS AND CALL IT A DAY END UP USING MY PHONE FOR ALL NAVIGATION
VOICE RECOGNITION OF COMMANDS
THE VOICE COMMAND OPTION IS NOT USER FRIENDLY THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING APPLICATION DOES NOT UPDATE OFTEN ENOUGH IF YOU TRY TO REFRESH THE CAR S STATUS LOCATION IT DOESN T REFRESH
THE SOUND QUALITY DURING A PHONE CALL ON THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM TENDS TO COME IN SCRATCHY AT TIMES
HIGHER QUALITY SPEAKERS AND IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION
MOVE THE CLOCK TO THE RADIO DISPLAY IT S TOO SMALL IN THE CLUSTER
BLUETOOTH INTERNET RADIO
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZE THE IPHONE IS AVAILABLE NOT SURE IF THIS AUDIO OR PHONE ISSUE I HAVE THE BEATS SPEAKERS NOT OVERLY IMPRESSED WITH THE SOUND PERFORMANCE GIVEN THE COST
AGAIN LOVE THE BLUETOOTH LOVE THE FEATURES OF THE AUDIO BUT THE RADIO AND SPEAKERS ARE HORRIBLE PROOF IS IN DODGE OFFERING A $ 400 00 AMP TO MAKE IT RIGHT WHERE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FROM THE GET GO NOT FOR AN ADDITIONAL $ 400 00 TO THE CONSUM
THE VOICE SYSTEM IS TOO SLOW IN A LOT OF CASES I CAN PUSH THE BUTTON OR NAVIGATE THE SCREEN FASTER
WELL I DON T USE FIAT S NAV SYSTEM MY IPHONE DOES IT BETTER
THERE S NO VISIBLE VOLUME INDICATOR THE GRAPHICS ON THE RADIO COULD BE A LITTLE SMALLER SO THAT THE ARTIST AND SONG TITLE COULD BOTH BE DISPLAYED
THE USB PLAYER IS NOT AS RESPONSIVE AS IT COULD BE THE SONGS ARE DIFFICULT TO BROWSE AND IT FORGETS THE POSITION OF THE LAST SONG SOMETIMES
IF IT COULD BE HANDS FREE
I WOULD LIKE IT IF THE CALLER ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE COULD HEAR ME WHEN USING THE CAR S BLUETOOTH
VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY COMPLICATED THERE ARE TO MANY STEPS TO ACCOMPLISH ANY TASK IT IS QUICKER TO USE MANUAL OPERATIONS
VOICE RECOGNITION IS HARD TO MANEUVER THROUGH AT TIMES DOESN T UNDERSTAND COMMANDS
COULD BE IMPROVED BY ADDING A TOUCH SCREEN COMPARED TO WHAT IS ALREADY OUT IN THE MARKET WITH OTHER CAR COMPANIES THIS CAR IS PRETTY BEHIND ON TECHNOLOGY
NEEDS APPLE CAR PLAY OPTION
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY WITH OTHER DEVICES WOULD BE A PLUS
NEED REAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE MICROPHONE WHEN I TALK WITH OTHER PEOPLE THE VOICE QUALITY THEY RECEIVE IS NOT VERY GOOD AT ALL
NAV SYSTEM ABILITY TO AVOID OFF ROUTE SITUATIONS WHEN I M ACTUALLY ON THE ROUTE
VOICE COMMANDS BOTH IN THEIR ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE VOICE COMMANDS AND THE EASE OF USING VOICE COMMANDS MEANING MORE LIKE SIRI OR GOOGLE NOW LESS LIKE AN AUTOMATED PHONE SYSTEM
THE BUILT IN SOFTWARE SHOULD DO A MUCH BETTER JOB OF IMPORTING RECOGNIZING MUSIC ON A USB FLASH DRIVE THE PHONE SHOULD PAIR MUCH QUICKER THAN IT DOES
THE USB BLUETOOTH SOMETIMES IS VERY SCRATCHY EVEN WHEN PLAYING AUDIO
HAVE A BUILT IN NAV SYSTEM THE TOM TOM ON A STICK SUCKS
VOICE RECOGNITION I DON T EVEN USE IT ANYMORE BECAUSE OF HOW UNRESPONSIVE INCORRECT IT ALWAYS WAS
DON T REALLY KNOW HOW TO USE VOICE COMMANDS
HAD MAJOR ISSUES IN THE BEGINNING WITH GENERATING VEHICLE HEALTH REPORT AND AFTER REPLACING A MODULE WITH CONNECTING TO THE SMART PHONE EVEN NOW HAVING ISSUES WITH CONNECTING TO PANDORA
IT WOULD BE NICE IF VOICE COMMANDS WERE RECOGNIZED MORE EASILY WITHOUT HAVING TO REPEAT SEVERAL TIMES
THE USB CONNECTION IS RATHER CUMBERSOME IN THAT IT FREEZES QUITE FREQUENTLY AND WILL SKIP AROUND MUSIC APPS
I LIVE IN A BORDER TOWN AND WHILE MY IPHONE HAS MAPS THAT WORK WHEN I CROSS THE BORDER AS SOON AS I AM ONE INCH INSIDE OF MEXICO MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS USELESS I NEVER USE IT BECAUSE OF THIS AND WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER FORD AGAIN
IMPROVE DRIVER EASE OF ACCESS TO TOUCH SCREEN AND OPTIONALLY INCREASE THE SIZE OF ICONS OUR OTHER VEHICLE IS A PRIUS AND THEY HAVE DONE IT RIGHT
SOME WAY TO LEARN THE VOICE COMMANDS EASIER THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM IT IS HARD TO LEARN OR MEMORIZE THEM
ANDROID AUTO
I VE NEVER GOTTEN USED TO VOICE RECOGNITION ON ANY TECHNOLOGY DEVISE SO I DON T REALLY USE IT HOWEVER THE PHONE AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE AMAZING I REALLY LOVE THE SOFT TOUCH OF ALL THE BUTTON CONTROLS THROUGHOUT THE CAR EASY T
THE NAV PROGRAM IS HARD TO NAVIGATE PUTTING IN AN ADDRESS ITS SOMETIMES LOST AND DOESN T AUTOMATICALLY GUIDE YOU THERE
MULTIPLE CD PLAYER RATHER THAN THE SINGLE PLAYER I HAVE NOW
THE RADIO TOUCHSCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN ON BUMPY ROADS
THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED AS IT IS VERY BASIC
THE UCONNECT FEATURES LIKE PANDORA HAVE DIFFICULTIES SYNCING AT TIMES I STILL HAVE NO BEEN ABLE TO SYNC MY PHONE BOOK WITH THE PHONE SYSTEM
VOICE COMMANDS DON T FUNCTION WELL HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO GET MY PHONE NAVIGATION TO WORK WITH THE BLUETOOTH
TRANSMISSION OF VOICE OVER MICROPHONE UNCLEAR
WHEN USING HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION THE SOUND COULD BE CLEARER IN OTHER WORDS THE PERSON I M TALKING TO COULD SOUND CLEARER
THE DISPLAY IS NOT AS SLEEK AS I D LIKE IT TO BE ESPECIALLY FOR BT STREAMING SOME ADDITIONAL EFFORTS CAN BE PUT IN THE OVERALL LOOK OF THE CONSOLE
USB PORT KEEPS TELLING ME TOO MANY FILES WHEN THERE IS ONLY 1 FILE ON THE USB STICK
BETTER SPEAKERS BETTER OUTGOING HANDS FREE PHONE CALL QUALITY SORRY THAT S 2
MORE COMMANDS FOR BLUETOOTH I DON T LIKE TO GET OUT MY IPHONE TO CHOOSE PLAYLISTS NEEDS TO HAVE MORE VOLUME IT IS NOT LOUD ENOUGH
MAKE THE VOICE COMMANDS EASIER
LOADING UP THE GPS SYSTEM COULD BE FASTER IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO TURN ON AND LOAD BEFORE AN ADDRESS CAN BE ENTERED MAKE THE DEVICE LESS CLUNKY TO INSTALL IN THE DASHBOARD I HAVE A SEPARATE GPS THAT I MANUALLY INSERT INTO A PORT IN THE DAS
SOUND QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED
SOUND OF VOICE QUALITY W HEN MAKING PHONE CALLS
YOU MUST INSTALL A HARD DRIVE LIKE MY EXPEDITION NOT HAVING A HARD DRIVE IS A MAJOR STEP BACKWARD THAT S WHY THE GRACENOTES DOESN T WORK LIKE IT SHOULD I CANT BELIEVE THIS DECISION WHO MADE THE DECISION TO BUILD AN AUDIO SYSTEM INFERIO
STILL LEARNING TO USE IT A BIT COMPLICATED AM USED TO A GARMIN ONLY HAVE HAD CAR FOR 3 MONTHS
VOICE COMMANDS FOR NAVIGATION MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE RACES ME WITH SYNC AND HIM USING AN IPHONE THE IPHONE ALLWAYS WINS TYPICALLY I GIVE UP TRYING WITH SYNC BECAUSE IT IS SOOOO FRUSTRATING
CELL PHONE RECEPTION FOR HANDS FREE CALLING IS POOR TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS AT BOTTOM OF SCREEN ARE HARD TO GET AT
THE NAVIGATION IS A LITTLE FUSSY BOTH WITH TOUCH SCREEN AND VOICE ACTIVATION
WE ONLY USE THE AM AND FM RADIO I FOUND SETTING THE CHOICE KEYS CONFUSING I THOUGHT I HAD THEM SET BUT THE NEXT TIME I DROVE THE CAR THEY WEREN T SET
INPUTTING A DESTINATION WHILE DRIVING NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED GARMIN DOES IT FAR BETTER UPDATES TO NAVIGATION MAPS AND POI S SHOULD BE INCLUDED FOR THE FIRST TWO TO THREE YEARS OF OWNERSHIP
WE DO NOT USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BECAUSE WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING AS SENIOR CITIZENS WE HAVE LITTLE NEED FOR THE ELECTRONIC GIMMICKS BUT IT LOOKS NICE THE BOOK LEAVE MUCH TO BE DESIRED COULDN T FIND AUTO WIPER INFO TO SHUT OFF FOR GOING
IT HAS SOME TROUBLE WITH VOICE RECOGNITION IT SEEMS THAT IF A DIFFERENT PERSON IS USING IT IT GOES HAYWIRE SO IT MAY RESPOND TO ME BUT IF MY FRONT SEAT PASSENGER TRIES TO USE IT THE SYSTEM SIMPLY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE WHAT HE OR SHE IS SAYING
NAVIGATION SCREENS ARE UN INTUITIVE AND CLUNKY AND SLOW TO USE THEIR DESIGN JUST SCREAMS MICROSOFT I MUCH PREFER MY GARMIN NUVI GPS UNIT
SOUND QUALITY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
PURE AND SIMPLE IT IS NOT VERY GOOD AUDIO IS POOR AND HANDS FREE PHONE CLARITY NOT THE BEST
ALLOW ACCESS TO POI GAS STATIONS AND RESTAURANTS WHILE MOVING ALSO SHOW ELEVATION IMPROVE SPEED LIMIT INFORMATION
VOICE RECOGNITION HARD
MY CARS BLUETOOTH IS NOT CONNECTING TO EACH OTHER
THE FACTORY SUBWOOFER IS WEAK AND UNDERPOWERED NOT ENOUGH CLEAN BASS DOOR SPEAKERS SHOULD CLIPPED TO PLAY ONLY MIDS AND HIGHS THEY ARE TRYING TO REPRODUCE LOW FREQUENCIES THEY CANNOT CLEANLY HANDLE OK TO MOST BUT NOT TO AUDIOPHILES EVEN
BEING ABLE TO PLAY IPOD MUSIC LOUDER
IMPROVE RESPONSE TIME TO INPUT ON TOUCH SCREEN SCREEN SLOW TO RESPOND TO INPUT COMPARED TO OTHER SYSTEMS
ITS ALMOST LIKE TEXTING WHILE DRIVING WITH SO MANY DISTRACTIONS
MAKE IT EASIER TO ADD DESTINATIONS
EASIER TO NAVIGATE
EASY TO USE TOUCH SCREEN
I STILL HAVE DIFFICULTIES COMMUNICATING WITH NAVIGATION
TOUCH SCREEN LEAVES SPOTS
WISH SPEAKERS SOUNDED BETTER AND SATTELITE RADIO SOUNDED BETTER
EASIER TO USE VOICE COMMANDS
THE NAV APP ON MY MOBILE PHONE IS EASIER TO USE SO I DON T USE THE ONE IN THE CAR
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO USED BY PASSENGER WHILE ROLLING WE HAVE TO USE A SECONDARY GPS FOR DIRECTIONS
THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR THE RADIO WHICH DOES TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO SCROLL THROUGH USING THE HANDS FREE OPTIONS WHILE DRIVING
I NEED SPECIFIC WRITTEN DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON ALL THE FEATURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AS I M SURE THAT I M MISSING SOME DUE TO A LACK OF TECH SAVVY
VOICE NAVIGATION REQUIRES MANY STEPS REAL TIME TRAFFIC AND ROUTING IS NOT AS EFFICIENT AS OTHER NAVIGATION APPS LIKE WAZE
VOICE RECOGNITION I WOULD PROBABLY USE IT MORE IF THE VOICE RECOGNITION WAS BETTER I HAVE TO REPEAT THINGS TOO MANY TIMES TO MAKE IT USEFUL
SEEK BUTTON ON STEERING WHEEL SHOULD EITHER GO TROUGH PRESET CHANNELS OR SEEK ALL CHANNELS ESPECIALLY SATELLITE RIGHT NOW IT SEEKS PRESETS ONLY
VOICE RECOGNITION DON T LIKE THE SPLIT SCREEN ON THE NAV SYSTEM
WHEN USING THE SYNC SYSTEM WITH THE BLUETOOTH PHONE THE WIND NOISE AND THE AIR FLOW NOISE FROM HEATERS INTERFERES WITH THE CALLERS ABILITY TO HEAR MY VOICE
FASTER NAVIGATION BETWEEN SCREENS
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION FOR SPECIFIC NAMES ON PHONE CALLS
TOO MUCH TOUCH SCREEN TECHNOLOGY
BE ABLE TO READ TEXT MESSAGES COMPOSE BY VOICE DISPLAY SMART PHONE SCREEN ON THE DISPLAY BE ABLE TO USE NAV IF SOMEONE IS IN THE PASSANGER SEAT AND THE VEHICLE IS MOVING BE ABLE TO DISPLAY DVD VIDEO ON THE DISPLAY FOR THE KIDS TO WATCH WHEN
SIRE WORK VERY GOOD MAKES BUILT IN VOICE RECOGNITION FEEL PAIN FULL
WOULD LIKE HARD BUTTON TO CHANGE INPUT VICE HAVING TO USE SCREEN OR THE STEERING WHEEL WHICH MOVES THRU THE INPUTS IN SEQUENCE
SINCE YOU DO NOT HANDLE TEXT BY AUDIO I TRY IPHONE TEXT MICROPHONE BUT ONCE PAIRED TO TRUCK THAT MICROPHONE NOR THE TRUCKS MICROPHONE SEEMS TO WORKS FOR THAT PURPOSE
SYSTEM IS SLOW TO UPDATE ESPECIALLY SATELLITE RADIO
DELAYS AND VOICE CONTROL
THE BLUETOOTH PHONE IT SOMETIMES DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE COMMAND OR NUMBER TO BE CALLED PEOPLE ON THE OTHER END HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY HEARING ME WHEN I SPEAK TO THEM THERE SHOULD BE SPEAKERS IN THE THIRD ROW SEATING FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM I D
AUDIO RECOGNITION OF THE NAV INSTRUCTIONS
THE ORDER OF INFO INPUT FOR NAVIGATION WOULD PERFER STREET   STREET NAME CITY STATE IN THAT ORDER THE WAY IT IS SET UP NOW TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO
MP3 FOLDERS ARE DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THROUGH QUICKLY ADD FAVORITES AND ALLOW THE FOLDERS TO BE MORE QUICKLY CYCLED THROUGH
IMPROVE EASE OF VOICE CONTROL AND COMMANDS AND UPDATE ACCURACY OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM
GOES TO PHONE REDIAL AND HAVE TO SCROLL MENU TO EXIT PHONE WHICH REMOVES HANDS FREE IDEA SHOULD HAVE A MORE IN DEPTH APP OR ON LINE LINK TO SHOW STEP BY STEP AND FULL FEATURES OF THE EQUIPMENT I DID NOT KNOW HALF OF OPTIONS WERE AVAILABLE UNTIL I
RADIO SOUNDS GREAT SOMETIMES PHONE RECEPTION NOT THAT GOOD HAVEN T USED NAV SYSTEM JUST HAD MAP ON
HAVE PROBLEMS WITH USING TOUCH SCREEN WHEN DRIVING ON ROUGH ROADS I USE VOICE COMMANDS THE ICONS COULD BE BIGGER
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY I TRIED TO USE IT BUT KEEP GOING BACK TO MY GARMIN
ENJOYED THE NAVIGATION FORMAT IN MODEL COMPARED TO VERSION ALSO SCREEN LAYOUT EASIER IN OLDER VERSION
THE NAV DOES NOT SHOW REAL TIME TRAFFIC YOU HAVE TO CLICK ON THE SETTINGS SCREEN AND GO INTO TO SERIOUS TO SEE IT ON A SEPARATE MAP IT IS BOGUS I WANT TO SEE REALTIME TRAFFIC AS I DRIVE
THE LAG TIME I SOMETIMES EXPERIENCE WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE A SONG WITH THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION COULD BE INVESTIGATED AND IMPROVED
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IN THE PLATINUM SERIES IS NOT VERY GOOD THE SPEAKERS ARE SO CHEAP THAT IF YOU TURN THE VOLUME UP THE RADIO CUTS OFF THE BASS AND TREBBLE SO THE CHEAP SPEAKERS DONT BREAK AND THIS MAKES THE RADIO SOUND WORSE ALL MORE CONTROLS
THE VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION ASPECT IS A COMPLETE JOKE I HAVE YET TO GET IT TO UNDERSTAND ME AND WORK PROPERLY NOT EVEN ONCE HAS IT WORKED I WIND UP SCREAMING AND CUSSING IT I GAVE UP AND PUNCH ALL ADDRESSES IN MANUALLY AND USE IT EVERY DAY
HAVING ALL THE RADIO STATIONS COME IN CLEAR
INITIAL SYNC FUNCTIONS AND SYNC INSTRUCTIONS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT HOW TO CONNECT AND LOCATE OTHER INSTRUCTION INFORMATION ONLINE
SYNC DISPLAY ISSUE HAS BEEN MY ONLY COMPLAINT OF THE SYSTEM BEYOND HOW I EXPECTED IT TO FUNCTION
CALLERS ON BLUETOOTH SAY THERE IS EXCESSIVE ROAD NOISE AS IF I HAVE A WINDOW OPEN WHEN AT INTERSTATE SPEEDS IN TRAFFIC
THE CURRENT DISPLAY IS HORRIBLE THE CAR SHOULD HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN OR AT LEAST A MULTI COLORED LCD
IT WOULD BE NICE IF I DIDN T HAVE TO RE SYNC MY PHONE EVERYTIME I GET IN MY CAR
FIX THE SYNC
JUST THE OVERALL USER FRIENDLY VOICE INTERFACE WHICH I BELIEVE IS BEING ADDRESSED WITH SYNC 3
NAVIGATION DISPLAYS ARE NOT INTUITIVE RATHER CLUNKY INTERFACE
FOR WHAT I USE THE SYSTEM IS VERY EASY TO INTUITIVELY NAVIGATE IT
PLACE THE DVD PLAYER SOMEWHERE MORE ACCESSIBLE CENTER CONSOLE IS NOT CONVENIENT
SOMETIMES IT S DIFFICULT TO USE VOICE COMMANDS LOLA DOESN T ALWAYS HEAR THE COMMANDS OR IT S A LONG TIME TO GET HER TO MOVE INTO ACTION
EASE OF USE OF VOICE CONTROLS
VOICE COMMAND DIFFICULT TO USE BECAUSE DOESN T RECOGNIZE COMMANDS EASILY
ALL VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE NAVIGATION WITH A TOUCH SCREEN AND SHOULD ALL STILL HAVE CD PLAYERS
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER MIS INTERPRETS COMMANDS FREQUENTLY
BUTTONS FOR RADIO STATIONS ARE TOO SMALL OR IN A BAD LOCATION TOP OF SCREEN WHEN DRIVING IT IS SOMETIME DIFFICULT TO TOUCH WOULD BE NICE FOR VOLUME CONTROLS ON FRONT OF STEERING WHEEL INSTEAD OF IN THE BACK
VOICE COMMANDS DON T WORK TEXT MESSAGES ARE NOT RECEIVED AND CAN T BE SENT NAVIGATION ESTIMATES ARE NOT ACCURATE
NOT SURE HOW TO GET PHONE TO WORK ALL THE TIME WITH THE HANDS FREE IT WORKED FOR THE FIRST MONTH THEN IT HASN T WORKED SINCE I CLEARLY DON T KNOW HOW TO USE IT HOWEVER IT IS A GREAT FEATURE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SEE EARLIER COMMENTS
NAVIGATE FASTER ROUTES MORE ACCURATELY
BLUETOOTH CONNECIVITY COULD BE INPROVED BUT ITS RARE THAT MY PHONE IS DROPPED ITS PROBABLY JUST A MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE APPLE OS IN THE CAR AND THE ANDROID OS OF MY PHONE
A CHARGER SHOULD BE STOCKED WITH NAVIGATION AND REAR VIEW VISUAL CAPABILITIES FOR THE PRICE OF THE VEHICLE THAT S ALMOST EXPECTED WITH THE CAR
THE VOLUME OF NAVIGATION GUIDE VOICE NEED LOUDER
HAVE A CLOCK VISIBLE WITHOUT HAVING TO USE ANY OF THE OTHER FEATURES
THE USB PORT WILL ONLY PLAY MP3 FORMATTED MUSIC FROM A MEMORY STICK THIS IS LIMITING I WISH IT COULD PLAY OTHER MORE MODERN AND HIGHER QUALITY FORMATS SUCH AAU OR WMA OR EVEN UNCOMPRESSED WAV MUSIC
DO NOTUSE THE COMMUNICATION OR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE NO HANDS VOICE COMMUNICATION APP COULD BE IMPROVED
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR BLUETOOTH IS HARD TO USE FOR NON ENGLISH SPEAKING PEOPLE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO NOT OVERRIDE THE DISTANCE TO EMPTY DISPLAY WHEN YOY ARE GOING ON A TRIP
I WISH THERE WERE MORE RADIO STATION PRESET SPOTS
SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING A PASSENGER CAN RUN IT SEEMS CRAZY I HAVE TO PULL OVER TO USE IT
PLAYBACK CONTROLS ON FRONT DASHBOARD OF THE REAR SEAT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM THE CONTROLS SOMETIMES DO NOT INITIATE THE APPROPRIATE COMMANDS ON THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM E G PLAY PAUSE FAST FORWARD ALSO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK
THERE IS A DELAY BETWEEN THE IPOD AND THE AUDIO SYSTEM
THE GRAPHICS ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CAN BE VERY HARD TO READ VERY BUSY LOOKING ON THE SCREEN
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE TYPED IN BY THE PASSENGER WHILE THE CAR IS DRIVING
I AM STILL READING THE MANUAL ON THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM I CONVINCED SIRRUS THAT I WANTED MORE THAN A THREE YEAR SUBSCRIPTION SINCE I KEEP CARS OR TRUCKS FOR AT LEAST 12 YEARS I GOT IT I DRIVE WITH GLOVES AND THE TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS CONDUCT
SOUND QUALITY OF BLUETOOTH
THE SOFTWARE NEEDS AN OVERHAUL THE TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS TO BE UPDATED
NAVIGATION TOOK AWHILE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE
VEHICLE READS TEXT MESSAGES BUT CAN T SEND REPLY VERBALLY
IT WOULD HELP IF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD SPEAK THE DIRECTIONS
THE LOOK OF THE TOUCH SCREEN COULD BE IMPROVED GREATLY OR GIVE YOU THE OPTION TO CUSTOMIZE THE BACKGROUND
MOVE THE LOCATION OF AUXILIARY PLUG
NAVIGATION COULD BE EASIER TO USE VOICE RECOGNITION OFTEN MISINTERPRETS WHAT IS SAID
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE
IN MY FORD EXPEDITION I REPLACED THE FACTORY RADIO WITH A KENWOOD DDX318 AND FOR NAVIGATION I USE A TOM TOM BOTH THOSE DEVICES ARE WAY SUPERIOR TO THE MICROSOFT PACKAGE FROM A UI FUNCTIONALITY ACCURACY AND COST PERSPECTIVE YOU CAN GET
DO NOT LIKE RADIO CONTROLS ON CONSOLE
CLEARER BETTER INSTRUCTIONS FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE NEWEST ROADS DON T SEEM TO BE IN THE NAVIGATION AND NAVIGATION DOESN T SEEM TO WORK WHILE DRIVING AS IF A PASSENGER WAS TO ENTER THE INFORMATION THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION SOMETIMES DOESN T RECOGNIZE MY VOICE OR COMMAND
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE DENALI HAD NAVIGATION WITH OR WITHOUT SIRUS BUT IT DOES NOT
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED SOUTHERN DRAW
I HAVE THE HIGHEST LEVEL AUDIO SYSTEM WITH THE SUB WOOFER IT DOESN T SOUND BAD BUT IT DOESN T FEEL LIKE THE SUBWOOFER IN THE TRUNK DOES MUCH
I HAD NO IDEA I COUDL EVEN DO VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION AND SOME OF THE OTHER TOOLS IF THAT S THE CASE ALONG WITH SOME OF THE OTHER FUNCTIONALITY I VE BEEN MISSING OUT ON IT WOULD BE A BIG PLUS TO HAVE THAT DEMOED AT THE DEALERSHIP RA
VOICE COMMAND NAVIGATION HAS REGRESSED FROM 2010
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT ACCURATE OR EFFECTIVE
SOUND QUALITY OF AUDIO IS GOOD OUTGOING SOUND QUALITY OF HANDS FREE CALLING IS NOT SO GOOD LOTS OF ROAD NOISE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS APPARENT TO OTHER END OF CALL WITH IPHONES AT LEAST
NAV IS FALLIBLE INFALLIBLE IS ALWASYS BETTER
NAVIGATION AND COMPASS ARE CURRENTLY DOWN DUE TO DEFECTIVE COMPUTER
I HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO FIND A GUIDE ME HOME FEATURE AND WOULD LIKE THAT ALSO THERE IS A SLIGHT DELAY ON THE TOUCH SCREEN THAT I FEEL COULD BE IMPROVED
NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE VOICE CONTROLS DO NOT WORK HALF THE TIME
VEHICLE NEEDS NAVIGATION SYSTEME AND BETTER SPEAKERS
AUDIO QUALITY COULD PROVIDE FOR A MORE RICH SOUND QUALITY WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO ALLOW SYNCING PHONE WITH A GOOGLE APPLE MAP APP INSTEAD OF FORCING THE CUSTOMER INTO ON STAR NAV
WHEN YOU HAVE BOSE SPEAKERS AND A SUB YOU BETTER MAKE SURE IT SOUNDS GOOD MY SISTERS FIRST CAR A 1986 DODGE RELIANT HAD A BETTER SOUNDING SOUND SYSTEM THAN THIS VEHICLE DOES TRULY FRUSTRATING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS BETTER INSTRUCTIONS ESPECIALLY FOR SAVING DESTINATIONS MY OLD GARMIN WORKS BETTER
ABILITY TO WORK WITH IPHONE
THE VEHICLE HAS NO CD PLAYER IN I FEEL CD S ARE STILL POPULAR ENOUGH THAT A CD PLAYER SHOULD BE BUILT INTO THE VEHICLE
THE NAV SYSTEM IS LESS THEN USEABLE HORRIBLE SET UP NO FAVORITES SECTION VERY DIFFICULT TO INPUT INFORMATION
MUST SPEND $1500 FOR DIFFERENT TRIM PKG TO GET SAT RADIO OFFER SAT RADIO ON ALL TRIM PKG
ADD MORE VALUE BETTER SCREEN DEFINITION BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION VERY BLAND SYSTEM
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED HAVING A MULTIPLE CD PLAYER IN THE VEHICLE I TRIED TO HAVE ONE ADDED AND HAVE BEEN TOLD I HAVE TO HAVE THE WHOLE AUDIO SYSTEM REMOVED TO HAVE THIS DONE THIS WAS DISAPPOINTING
MISSING CD PLAYER
FM RADIO SOUND QUALITY
GET RID OF THE COMPLICATED SCREEN AND USE BUTTONS LIKE OUR SILVERADO EVEN USING ONSTAR PHONEN IS MORE COMPLICATED WITH TOO MUCH YIK YAK FROM OPERATOR DID ON HAVE IN THE
WE WERE SUPPOSE TO HAVE MORE APPS WITH THE INTELLILINK AND MYLINK ONE OF THE REASONS I WENT WITH GM AND IN VEHICLE 4G LTE ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE SYSTEM AND IT IMPENDING CABABILITIES WHAT IT HAS NOW IS VERY LACKING GM PLEASE BRING US APPLE
VERY NICE AUDIO SYSTEM
I DON T LIKE THAT THE NAG SYSTEM ALWAYS GIVES THE OTHER COUNTRY INFORMATION BC UNLIKELY AND UNNESESSARAY AND TAKES LONGER TO GET TO ROUTE GUIDANCE
I WISH MY OLDER IPOD WOULD PLAY IN THE VEHICLE AND REALLY DON T UNDERSTAND WHY NOT
MAKE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM RELIABLE
NAVIGATION EASE OF USE
RECOGNIZING WHAT THE DRIVER WAS LISTENING TO ON THE LAST DRIVE WHETHER IT WAS FM SATELLITE BLUETOOTH OR IPOD MY HONDA WOULD GO BACK TO WHATEVER I WAS LISTENING TO LAST THE ACADIA ALWAYS DEFAULTS TO THE IPOD EVEN IF IT WASN T WHAT I WAS LISTEN
NO XM RADIO PROVIDED
RESOLVE ISSUES WITH IPHONE AND TEXT MESSAGING NOT BEING FULLY AVAILABLE
I WISH I COULD ACCESS THE FULL MENU VIA BLUETOOTH
MENUS ARE NOT INTUITIVE OR WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE OWNER MANUAL RATHER DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOSE SOUND QUALITY COMPARED TO MY 2003 BOSE SYSTEM IN MY MERCEDES ML350 10 YEARS SHOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT BUT ACTUALLY NOT SO MUCH VERY DISAPPOINTED TH
AUDIO SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO KEEP FROM COMING ON AT START UP ANNOYING TO A PERSON THAT RARELY LISTENS TO MUSIC ON THE SYSTEM
THE VOICE COMMAND NEVER GETS IT RIGHT AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MAPS ARE REALLY HARD TO READ ESPECIALLY WHILE DRIVING
I EXPECT MUCH MORE RESPONSIVENESS OF TOUCH SCREEN SIMILAR TO WHAT AN IPAD IS ABLE TO OFFER
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T WORK FOR NAVIGATION USUALLY
SOMETIMES IF TWO BLUETOOTH CONNECTED PHONES ENTER THE VEHICLE WE HAVE TO TURN ONE OFF FOR THE SYSTEM TO BE USABLE
CENTRALIZE THE SPEAKER PICK UP FOR USE WITH THE MOBILE PHONE AND ONSTAR SO THE PASSENGERS VOICE IS PICK UP BETTER THE SPEAKER PICK UP IS CURRENTLY POSITIONED ABOVE THE DRIVERS SIT
THERE IS QUITE A LAG WHEN USING THE VOICE COMMAND AND IPHONE THE TEXT MESSAGE FUNCTION APPEARS TO EITHER NOT BE FUNCTIONAL ON MY TRUCK OR I DON T KNOW HOW TO USE IT WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR ME USING COMPUTER DEVICES I GUESS I NEED TO SPEND MORE TI
ADD A HOME BUTTON ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO QUICKLY NAVIGATE HOME
NAVIGATION AND VOICE COMMANDS COULD BE MUCH BETTER CONNECTIVITY OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WITH THE IPHONE 6 IS SPOTTY AT BEST SYSTEM ALSO SEEMS TO BE SLOW OR BOGGED DOWN AT TIMES PROBABLY DUE TO POOR COMPATIBILITY
THE INTELLINK SYSTEM NEEDS AN APP STORE AND MORE CONNECTIVITY TO IPHONES THERE NEEDS TO HAVE THE OPTION TO WATCH VIDEOS FROM PHONE S LIBRARY & YOUTUBE THE OVERALL SYSTEM IS NICE BUT THE LACK OF APPS FOR ENTERTAINMENT NAVIGATION AND WEATHER IS
NAVIGATION DISPLAY IS LACKING NOT AS GOOD AS PORTABLE GARMIN GPS
HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM RECOGNIZING MY VOICE AND ALSO TYPED IN DESTINATIONS ON ONE OCCASION I HAD TO PUT THE DESTINATION IN MY MOBILE PHONE SINCE THE NAVIGATION DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE DESTINATION
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OPEN MY GARAGE DOOR WITHOUT HAVING TO USE A REGULAR REMOTE DEVICE I WAS SURPRISED THAT THIS WASN T A FEATURE
NAVIGATION TOO HARD TO USE MY GAR IN WAS BETTER
VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM VERY POOR
USE OF PANDORA RADIO APP THROUGH BLUETOOTH WOULD BE GREAT
PANDORA APPLICATION ON THE TOUCJ SCREEN DISPLAY WORKS POORLY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS REALLY CLUNKY AND NEEDS A MAJOR OPERATING SYSTEM   PROCESS OVERHAUL PLUS IT IS MISSING SOME FEATURES AND EASE OF USE OPTIONS
THE TOUCH SCREEN GETS VERY CONFUSING WHEN TRYING TO DRIVE AND MAKE CHANGES TO THE RADIO
THE DISPLAY IS TOO BRIGHT AND BUSY I WOULD PREFER THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM FOR THE RADIO WHERE YOU CAN FLOW THRU THE GROUPS OF STATIONS WITHOUT HAVING TO SWIPE THE SCREEN ALSO THE ABILITY TO SHUT THE BACK UP CAMERA OFF
THE ONSTAR RECEPTION IS UNACCEPTABLE COMPARED TO THE SYSTEM IN MY GMC I HAVE MADE INQUIRIES TO RESOLVE AND NO ANSWERS YET THE ATT CONNECTION IS NOT GOOD
VOICE RECOGNITION IS HORRIBLE
THE FAVORITES SHOULD SCROLL WHEN YOU MOVE TO THE NEXT PAGE OF FAVORITES THAT IS SERIOUSLY DUMB THAT YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR FINGER TO CHANGE THE VISIBLE 5 FAVORITES HORRIBLE UI FOR A MOVING VEHICLE
INDEPENDENT AND NOT RELYING ON ONSTAR FOR EVERYTHING I DO NOT HAVE ONSTAR THAT S WHY MY NAVIGATION VEHICLE DIAGNOSTICS ETC DON T WORK I HAD A NISSAN FRONTIER SD CARD NAVIGATION LOVED IT
NO APPS OR ANYWAY TO CUSTOMIZE CONTENT NOTHING LIKE IPHONE AND ITS NOT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ISNT AVAILABLE INTELLILINK WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE MORE UPDATES AND ITS DISAPPOINTING IT DOESNT FRIEND BOUGHT A JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE THE SYSTEM HAD MUCH MORE
INPUTTING DESTINATIONS
NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION HAVE TO PULL OVER TO ENTER ADDRESS OR ENTER IT BEFORE HAND
VOICE RECOGNITION IS WAY TO SLOW AND INACCURATE
CONNECTIVITY OF ITUNES FROM IPHONE WITHOUT ALWAYS OPENING ITUNES TO GET YOUR MUSIC TO PLAY
WOULD HAVE BETTER HAD A RADIO WITH GPS MAP INTO DASH
THE CONTROLS FOR THE IPOD ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL CORRECTLY THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO CONTROL THE SELECTION IS DAUNTING WHEN TRYING TO SELECT FORWARD OR BACK FOR THE CD THE TOGGLE SWITCH IS EASILY DEPRESSED WHICH CHANGES THE AUDIO SO
THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED IMMENSELY
VOICE RECOGNITION AND AS STATED EARLIER IN SURVEY NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO CONSISTENTLY OFFER MORE THAN ONE ROUTE OPTION WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE
BETTER SOUND QUALITY WITH MUSIC BETTER ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND SPOKEN LANGUAGE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO MAKE PHONE CALLS ABILITY TO HAVE HANDS FREE TEXTING OR AUDIBLE TEXT READING I DO REALLY LIKE HOW THERE IS A AUTO ADJUST WHEN GOING FROM MUSIC TO
SOUND QUALITY FOR AUDIO IS GOOD BUT NOT GREAT  BUT I PAID FOR THE BASE MODEL WITH NO UPGRADES SO I AM NOT DISSATISFIED
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE SLOW TO CHANGE RADIO STATIONS
IN CABIN MICROPHONE IS NOISY TO PHONE CALL RECIPIENT
USB NOT WORKING NAVIGATION NOT WORKING PARTS BACK ORDERED DUE TO WATER DAMAGE
SINCE I DON T HAVE XM RADIO TRIAL PERIOD OVER I WOULD RATHER NOT HIT ON XM RADIO AT ALL WHEN I USE THE SOURCE FEATURE
VOICE RECOGNITION IS SLOW TO INTERPRET ADDRESSES AND POINTS OF INTEREST PROBABLY A FIRMWARE UPGRADE LATER COULD REMEDY THIS OFTEN A REPEAT OF THE PROCESS IS REQUIRED TO GET IT RIGHT THE TOUCHSCREEN SOMETIMES REFUSES TO BE ACCESSED WHILE THE VE
SINCE NO ONE SHOWED US HOW TO USE THE VOICE ACTIVATED FEATURES AND I VE BEEN TOO BUSY TO PULL OUT THE INSTRUCTIONS WE HAVEN T USED IT
I EXPECTED BETTER MORE POWERFUL SOUND FROM THE BOSE SYSTEM BARELY ADEQUATE
EASE OF ENTERING NAVIGATION DESTINATION VOICE RECOGNITION
NAV SYSTEM KIND OF A PAIN TO ENTER LOCATIONS NEW SYSTEM FOR ME THOUGH I WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH OLD TRUCK SO THIS MIGHT BE A ME FAULT
FRONT SEAT PASSENGER NEEDS TO HAVE FULL CONTROL OF ENTERTAINMENT CONTROLS TOUCH SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO WORK FASTER
I HAVE NOT HAD MUCH USE FOR NAVIGATION NEEDS DURING THE FIRST 3 MONTHS WITH THE VEHICLE I WILL HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY NEXT MONTH FOR A GODD PERIOD OF TIME AND CAN EVALUATE BETTER
IT WOULD BE NOCE IF THE NAV SYSTEM STORED PREVIOUS DESTINATIONS MAYBE IT DOES AND I JUST HAVEN T FIGURED IT OUT YET
SENIOR CITIZEN DRIVER NOT TECH SAVVY NOT REALLY SOMETHING I AM ENAMORED WITH
DO NOT ALLOW TEXT OR NON HANDS FREE TELEPHONE CONNECTION IN MOVING VEHICLE
GARMIN GPS INTERFACE WOULD BE SO MUCH NICER AND RESPONSE TIME TO BUTTONS IS SLOWER THAN IDEAL
IT S GOOD BUT STILL VOICE RECOGNITION CAN BE ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES
WHEN USING THE TOUCH SCREEN IT TAKES A FEW TAPS TO GET A RESPONSE I D LIKE TO SEE A LARGER AREA TO TAP ON IT SOMETIMES SLIPS TO ANOTHER AND CAUSES AN INCORRECT RESPONSE
THE REAR SEAT ENTERTAINMENT IS SO DIFFICULT TO USE THE CONTROLS ARE HORRIBLE IF YOU HAVE SMALL CHILDREN 1990 S CONNECTIVITY AND WITH THE SCREEN DOWN THE REAR WINDOW MIGHT AS WELL BE METAL AS ITS USELESS
APPARENTLY I GOT THE MODEL THAT DOESN T HAVE A FULL BLUETOOTH CONNECTION FOR THE PHONE I CAN CONNECT AND USE IT TO MAKE AND RECEIVE CALLS BUT IT DOESN T SYNC WITH MY CONTACTS IN THE PHONE I WOULD HAVE TO MANUALLY ENTER ALL OF THESE CONTACTS I
AUDIO SYSTEM IS TOO CONFUSING
MAYBE A LITTLE BETTER SPEAKERS OR A LITTLE EASIER NAV SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS
PAIR UP BETTER WITH MY IPHONE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NOT NAV EQUIPPED HAVE NOT STUDIED OPERATION ENOUGH AT THIS POINT
SOUND IS HARD TO HEAR WHEN DRIVING AND RECEIVING A PHONE CALL HAD TO TURN OFF THE SPEAKERS AND WORK WITH THE MOBILE PHONE INDEPENDENTLY
EASIER MENU NAVIGATION
BLUETOOTH FOR USE OF IPHONE AND APPS
SHOULD BE ABLE TO TUNE RADIO WITH KNOB OR TOUCHSCREEN
COME UP WITH A SOFTWARE UPDATE SO YOU CAN HAVE MORE FINE CONTROL OF AM FM XM FROM THE STEERING WHEEL MAKE THE TUNING KNOB WORK LIKE A TUNING KNOB SHOULD WORK DIRECTLY TUNE THE RADIO BANDS SO I DON T HAVE TO LOOK AT A SCREEN WHILE DRIVING TO CH
VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY
I NEED TO GET THE BLUETOOTH WORKING
EASIER INPUT OF ADDRESSSES TO NAVIGATION
ALLOW PHONE NAVIGATION APP TO DISPLACE ON THE VEHICLE S SCREEN
AS MENTIONED EARLIER VOICE RECOGNITION IS A LITTLE FRUSTRATING
LOOK AT AN IPOD PHONE FOR EASE OF TOUCHSCREEN DIFFICULT ROUSE ROCKER SWITCH FOR BACK  AND PUSH KNOB TO SELECT
THERE ARE TOO MANY STEPS TO FIND WHAT YOU WANT VOICE CONTROL COULD MAKE THIS EASIER
APPLICATIONS ARE NOT USER FRIENDLY I AM HAVING A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT HOW TO USE THEM THE MANUAL INPUT FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY TIME CONSUMING AND CONFUSING I TOOK A USER CLASS AT MY DEALERSHIP EARLY ON AND THEY DID NOT ADDRESS AN
CONNECTION TO BLUETOOTH
IT S MORE DIFFICULT THAN IT NEEDS TO BE TO FIND A POINT OF INTEREST IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I AM NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE NAV SYSTEM THE AUDIO AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS ARE OK
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS TO NEED SOME WORK IT DOESN T SEEM TO RECOGNIZE MY VOICE COMMANDS VERY WELL
I MOST FREQUENTLY USE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION SINCE MY PASSENGERS CHILDREN USE IT TOO WE FREQUENTLY SWITCH BETWEEN PHONES AND THE USB SEEMS CRANKY OFTEN GETS FUSSY WHEN ADDING PHONES OR SELECTING PHONES
PANDORA APP DOES NOT WORK
MY CAR IS SUPPOSE TO READ MY TEXT MESSAGES BUT WITH READING THE MANUAL WE WERE UNABLE TO MAKE IT WORK WE WERE ALSO UNABLE TO SAVE PHONE NUMBERS ON CONSOLE
THE TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM IS A LITTLE HARD TO USE NEED TO PRESS HARD
I DO NOT HAVE NAVIGATION THE OPTION WAS TOO EXPENSIVE
I WOULD GIVE A 9 IF ONLY I COULD USE MY NEW CELL PHONE IN THE CAR UNFORTUNATELY OUR BLUETOOTH S ARE NOT COMPATIBLE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK WELL
VOICE RECOGNITION HAS TROUBLE WITH DICTION
I M NOT SURE WHETHER IT MY PHONE OR THE CAR BUT IT SEEMS HARD FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ME WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE FEATURE
I HAVEN T USED THE AUDIO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEMS ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH IT I AM STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE IT MAKING IT EASIER TO USE WOULD BE THE ONE ASPECT I WOULD CHANGE
NEEDS DIRECT OUTGOING CALL FLOW PERHAPS EVEN LESS BUTTON OPTIONS THAT ARE POTENTIAL DISTRACTIONS WHILE DRIVING THE THREE STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS THAT CONTROL VOICE COMMANDS NEED TO BE ONE BUTTON MAKE VOICE COMMAND END VOICE COMMAND OR CALL
AS I HAVE INDICATED PREVIOUSLY IN THIS SURVEY I DO NOT LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEMS AND I DO NOT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN
I WISH IT HAD NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I AM HEARING IMPAIRMENT WISH TO HAVE BETTER ACCESSIBILITY FOR DEAF PEOPLE SUCH FLASH WARNING SYSTEM AT SAME TIME AUDIO WARNING OR ALERTS
HAVING A BUILT IN RADIO FOR SIRIUS AND NAVIGATIONS SYSTEM
SPEAKERS WEAK VS PRIVOUS FITS MAP DIRECTIONS VS RADIO WHEN USING NAVIGATION FROM PHONE LOG BITS OF TIME WHEN RADIO IS OFF USING GOOGLE MAPS AND NO VOICE DIRECTIONS WHEN USING APPLE MAPS
I MISS THE GPS BUT I DO USE MY IPHONE WHEN NEEDED
ABILITY TO CONTROL AUDIO FROM EXTERNAL DEVICE PHONE IPOD WHILE CONNECTED VIA USB RATHER THAN CONTROLLING FROM CONSOLE
IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION SO YOU DON T HAVE TO WAIT FOR IT TO GO THROUGH THE DIRECTIONS EVERY TIME BEFORE YOU CAN SPEAK IMPROVE SO IT ACTUALLY RECOGNIZES NAME YOU SAY IMPROVE ENTIRE MENU SYSTEM FOR AUDIO IT S RIDICULOUSLY COMPLICATED FOR WHAT Y
DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THE RADIO PERHAPS I NEED TO READ THE OWNERS MANUAL
TOUCH SCREEN DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK YOU HAVE TO TOUCH IT SEVERAL TIMES
THE ABILITY TO CONNECT A FLASH DRIVE STORAGE UNIT IN AND PLAY YOUR MUSIC FROM THAT DEVICE IS GREAT I LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN ALL THE TIME AND DON T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SOMEBODY SPOTTING AN I POD AND BREAKING IN TO STEAL IT
SPEAKERS SOUND CHEAP NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM INSTALLED
DON T LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY UNATTRACTIVE ALSO THE VOLUME CONTROL BUTTONS ARE WEIRD AND TOO SMALL
THIS IS A CAR I SHOULD BE DRIVING AND ONLY DRIVING MUSIC IS OKAY OTHERWISE I DO NOT NEED NOR CARE TO HAVE OTHER COMS NAVIGATION OR ENTERTAINMENT THOSE SHOULD JUST BE REMOVED TO ALLOW MORE SPACE FOR THE DRIVER AND TO BE ABLE TO SEE
I REALLY HATE THAT THE CAR IS ONLY BUILT TO TRULY INTERFACE WITH APPLE PRODUCTS SUCH AS AN IPHONE OR IPOD I HAVE ANDROID DEVICES BUT FOR THE MOST PART I CAN T CONTROL THEM HANDS FREE EXCEPT THROUGH VERY BASIC BLUETOOTH HONDA REALLY NEEDS TO AD
TOUCH SCREEN DOESN T WORK WITH GLOVES ON SMALL BUTTONS
SOUND QUALITY IS POOR
USING THE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS WHILE DRIVING IS FOR ME NOT AS EASY AS TRADITIONAL MANUAL CONTROLS
THE SPEAKER VOLUME SEEMS TO VARY WHILE DRIVING MOST NOTICEABLE WITH A CD PLAYING I MAY HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO SHUT OFF THE VEHICLE SPEED THING SVC ITS TECH OVERKILL JUST NOTICED THE PROBLEM
CANT FIGURE OUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION
USB PORT SHOULD BE ABLE TO READ MP3
THE HARDEST IS PART IS THAT THE HANDS FREE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY
THE AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN ARE VERY SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO ADJUST WHEN DRIVING I AM CONCERNED THEY COULD LEAD TO ACCIDENTS FOR EXAMPLE TO ADJUST THE SOUND LEVEL YOU HAVE TO TOUCH A SMALL BUTTON ALONG SIDE OF SEVERAL OTHERS TO ADJ
NEED IPHONE 5 6 FOR APPS TO USE WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO USE DIFFERENT PHONES
MAKING CHANGES IN THE AUDIO SYSTEM REQUIRES MORE ATTENTION FROM THE DRIVER THAN IS SAFE IN MOST TRAFFIC SITUATIONS I FIND THAT I HAVE TO MAKE THE CHANGES SAY FROM RADIO TO IPHONE BEFORE BEGINNING THE TRIP AND EVEN CHANGING RADIO STATIONS CAN
NEEDS VOLUME CONTROL OTHER THAN TOUCH SCREEN SHOULD HAVE SATELLITE RADIO
TOUCH SCREEN IS TOO SENSITIVE AND IT IS TOO EASY TO ACCIDENTALLY SELECT THE WRONG BUTTON
THE CD PLAYER IS BARE BONES IT COULD AT LEAST USE A REPLAY FEATURE
ABILITY TO ACCESS SONG LISTS OF ALBUMS ON PHONE AND IPOD TOUCH IS BAD I TRADED A HYUNDAI SONATA SE FOR MY CRV AND THE SYSTEM IN THAT CAR WAS VERY SUPERIOR
THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TOO SLOW
I AM NOT ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE VOICE COMMANDS ON ANY THING EXCEPT PHONE
1 SONY SPEAKERS ARE JUST AVERAGE AT BEST 2 IMPROVE MY FORD SYNC USER INTERFACE
SOMETIMES MY IPHONE 6 PLUS CANNOT BE CONTROLLED BY THE CAR SAY IF I ANSWER A PHONE CALL OR MAKE A PHONE CALL THE MUSIC SHOULD START BACK UP AGAIN BUT IT DOESN T ALWAYS ALSO THEN I LL GO INTO THE ENTERTAINMENT SITE AND HIT PLAY PAUSE BUT IT
SOUND IS LOW QUALITY FEW CHANGES IN ADJUSTMENTS ALWAYS HEAR FROM FRONT SPEAKERS WHEN FADE TO REAR YOU LOOSE VOLUME DRASTICALLY MICROPHONE IS STATIC SOUNDING FROM LISTENERS POINT OF VIEW
VOICE COMMANDS ARE NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD AND THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE SATELLITE RADIO COULD BE BETTER
THE VECHILE MUST BE STOPPED IN ORDER TO ADD AN ADDRESS FOR NAV THIS IS VERY INCONVINENT I TYPICALLY USE MY PHONE INSTEAD OF THE CAR NAV
SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER SOMETIMES VOICE COMMANDS PROMPTS DIALS WRONG NUMBERS
VOICE RECOGNITION COMMAND SYSTEM IT S NOT VERY SMART NOR VERY EASY TO USE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE EASIER TO OPERATE
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT I CAN AND CAN T DO WITH SYNC WITHIN MY FORD MODEL I STILL DON T KNOW WHAT FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE TO ME
THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND COMMUNICATION IS AVERAGE AT BEST AND THE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS OVERCOMPLICATE OPERATIONS AND DISTRACT FROM DRIVING
THE XM RADIO DOES NOT KEEP A SIGNAL I DON T KNOW IF THAT IS THE RADIO SERVICE PROBLEM OR CONNECTIVITY WITH THE CAR
MORE USER FRIENDLY SYNC TECHNOLOGY THAT AUTOMATICALLY LOADS PHONE BOOK
VOICE RECOGNITION WORKS POORLY WHEN EITHER SUING PHONE OR AUDIO SYSTEM
HIGHER QUALITY SPEAKERS WOULD BE NICE BUT I DID NOT PURCHASE THE UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM PACKAGE
DOESN T RECOGNIZE VOICE COMMANDS AT TIMES HOWEVER IT STILL MAKES THE SYSTEM EASIER TO USE THAN THE ALTERNATIVE ESPECIALLY WHILE EN ROUTE
HAVE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL THAT SCAN THROUGH RADIO STATIONS AND NOT JUST THE PRE SETS
SYNC SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE WORDS TOO SLOW AS WELL BY THE TIME YOU GET A RESPONSE YOU HAVE PAST THE TURNING POINT
5 OR 6 CD SLOTS
INTERCONNECTION AND USABILITY VERY POOR WITH IPHONE ON USB FOR MUSIC PLAYBACK NAVIGATION BROWSE FOR SPOTIFY IS NONEXISTENT ONLY ITUNES RECOGNIZED VOICE RECOGNITION POOR APPEARS TECHNOLOGY SEVERAL GENERATIONS OLD THE EMBEDDED UI NAVIGATION
THE OVERALL SOUND QUALITY OF THE SPEAKER SYSTEM COULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED MY MAZDA 3 WITH A BASE SOUND SYSTEM SOUNDS BETTER THAN THE PREMIUM SYSTEM THAT COMES WITH THE MUSTANG GT PREMIUM
VOICE RECOGNITION CAN BE HIT OR MISS
THE USB PORT CUTS OFF AFTER YOU RESTART THE CAR SO YOU NEED TO RESET IT BACK FROM THE RADIO THAT TAKES TIME AND IT SUCKS
VOICE RECOGNITION AND AVAILABLE VOICE COMMANDS SOMETIME REQUIRE REPEATING AND IF IT MISUNDERSTANDS VOICE COMMAND IT SOMETIMES TAKES YOU COMPLETELY BACK TO THE BEGINNING SOME LEARNING IS REQUIRED BUT WORKS WELL ONCE YOU FIGURE OUT THE TICKS
VOICE RECOGNITION OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE SYNC INTERFACE IS HARD TO USE WHEN DRIVING I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME USING THE HARD BUTTONS AS THE SCREEN DOES NOT ALWAYS DO THE CORRECT ACTION WHEN PRESSED
ACCESSING THE PLAYLIST FILE SYSTEM IN AN IPHONE IS NOT POSSIBLE USING VOICE OR MANUAL CONTROLS I HAVE TO USE THE PHONE ITSELF
IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO USE MORE APPS
SYNC SYSTEM SEEMS TOO COMPLICATED TO USE RECEIVED LITTLE TO NO TRAINING IN SETTING UP OR USING THE SYSTEM AND THE PROVIDED DOCUMENTATION IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND
I CAN T SEEM TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT AUDIO DEVICE I E I D LIKE TO HAVE IT DEFAULT TO MY PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH BUT I CAN T SEEM TO GET IT TO DO THAT IT WILL DEFAULT TO THE LAST ITEM USED FOR AM OR FM RADIOS BUT NOT SATELLITE
THE SFE WASN T AVAILABLE WITH NAVIGATION AND IS NOT A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD HAVE LIKED THE FORD MYTOUCH WITH NAV
FORD SYNC DOES NOT WORK WITH OUR IPOD
RESPONSIVENESS OF TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY
SOUND IS PRETTY GOOD BUT I LIKE TO BE ABLE TO FILL THE CAR WITH MUSIC AND NOT BE OVERPOWERED BY IT THE ONLY CAR THAT EVER DID THIS FOR ME WAS A 1983 BUICK RIVIERA WITH THE BOSE SYMPHONIC SURROUND SYSTEM NOTHING ELSE HAS EVEN COME CLOSE
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM WORK BETTER
THE INTERFACE NEEDS UPDAING THE NEW SYNC 3 0 SHOULD BE BETTER THE ABILITY TO UPDATE THE INTERFACE TO CARPLAY WOULD BE FANTASTIC
RATHER THAN RELYING ON VOICE RECOGNITION TO SEARCH THE CONTACTS ON A SMARTPHONE TO INITIATE A PHONE CALL ADD A DISPLAY OF THE CONTACTS LIST SO THAT THERE IS A CHOICE TO TOUCH THE SCREEN OR NAVIGATE THE SCREEN WITHOUT HAVING TO USE VOICE RECOGNITI
I REALLY NEED TO USE THE VOICE COMMAND
VOICE RECOGNITION ALMOST NEVER GETS THE COMMANDS RIGHT REGARDLESS OF ANNUNCIATION OR SPEED
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT IN MY PURCHASE WHICH I REFLECT HIGHLY IN MY RATING BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PIECE THE SYSTEM NEEDS TO RESPOND FASTER AND BE EASIER TO INPUT NEED BETTER MAP SCREENS AND ABILITY TO
THE STEREO COULD BE A LITTLE LOUDER AND COULD USE A SUBWOOFER I DON T USE THE SYNC COMMUNICATION SO I CAN T REALLY SAY IF IT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT OR NOT I MORE OF A MANUAL SETTING PERSON
ADJUSTING THE VOICE LEVEL OF THE NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS WAS NOT CLEAR IT TOOK A WEEK TO FIGURE IT OUT
THE CELL PHONE PAIRING SYNCING IS NOT VERY GOOD FOR PLAYING MUSIC
WHEN PHONE IN CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH THE NAVIGATION INSTRUCTIONS DON T COME THE THE SPEAKERS WHEN WE LISTEN TO THE RADIO WE HAVE TO HAVE THE OUTPUT SET FOR BLUETOOTH AND CAN T LISTEN TO THE RADIO
THE AUDIO QUALITY COULD BE ENHANCED ADD ABILITY TO CONTROL AUDIO EQUALIZATION CONTROLS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE THE MOST USEFUL SAFE OVER DASHBOARD CONTROLS VOICE COMMANDS
WHEN I AM USING MY PHONE HANDSFREE PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THEY REALLY CAN T UNDERSTAND ME I QUITE OFTEN USE MY HEAD SET ALSO I DO NO LIKE BEING UNABLE TO HAVE MUSIC PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND WHEN ON THE PHONE THE BLUETOOTH LADY HAS TOO
REALLY WISH THE VEHICLE CAME WITH A BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
MAKING THE TOUCH SCREEN MORE VISUALLY APPEALING WHILE DISPLAYING MUSIC STATION INFORMATION AND ABLE TO DO MORE THINGS
DO NOT NOW OR PLAN ON IN THE FUTURE USING ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE CD PLAYER AND THE AM FM RADIO
WHEN SPEAKING TO ANOTHER PERSON EITHER BLUETOOTH TO BLUETOOTH OR BLUETOOTH TO CELL PHONE IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ME AND I THEN HAVE TO SWITCH OUT OF HANDS FREE MODE WHICH IS ILLEGAL IN A LOT OF STATES
CONSTANT TROUBLE WITH VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
I DO NOT LIKE THAT IT PLAYS MY IPHONE MUSIC AUTOMATICALLY SIMPLY WHEN I CONNECT MY PHONE VIA THE USB PORT
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM IN EVERY VEHICLE I HAVE SAT IN THE GENESIS IS NO BETTER OR NO WORSE THAN THE OTHER HIGHER END VEHICLES
NAVIGATION COULD BE IMPROVED BY OFFERING DRIVER CHOICE OF MULTIPLE ROUTE OPTIONS
NAV SYSTEM FEATURES TAKE TIME TO LEARN NAV SYSTEM IS PROPRIETARY TO HYUNDAI NOT SIMILAR TO GARMIN WHICH IS MORE INTUITIVE TO USE
MANUALLY DIALING PHONE NUMBERS SEEMS OVERLY COMPLICATED
THE VOICE COMMANDS SIMPLY DON T WORK FOR ANYTHING HOLDING THE SPEAK BUTTON DOWN LONG ENOUGH TO CALL UP SIRI WORKS PERFECTLY SO WITH SIRI THE SYSTEM IS GREAT EXCEPT AS NOTED EARLIER HER NAVIGATING DOES NOT INCLUDE DISPLAY ON THE GENESIS M
NAV SYSTEM MAKES SOME STANGE ROUTES SOMETIMES THIS MAY HAVE BEEN CORRECTED BY A NAV UPDATE THAT CAME OUT JUST WEEKS AFTER I GOT MY CAR I M NOT PAYING FOR THE UPDATE ALSO THE AUDIO DOES NOT SOUND NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE BASE STEREO IN MY 07 BMW
AUDIO QUALITY IS TERRIBLE NO BASS HORRIBLE TREBLE MIDS I WILL NOT BE PURCHASING LEASING A NEW HYUNDAI ELANTRA UNTIL THE QUALITY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS IMPROVED
EQUALIZER FOR RADIO COULD BE UPDATED
MAKE THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE ON NAV SYSTEM EASIER TO USE AND MAKE SURE IT WORKS
LOCATION OF STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
DISPLAYING THE ENTIRE NAME OF THE ARTIST OR SONG ON THE TOUCH SCREEN WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC
TOTALLY UPDATED NAV INFO SO DIRECTIONS ARE CLEAR OTHERWISE IT IS WORSE THAN NOT HAVING ONE AT ALL
LOT TO LEARN I WISH DEALER OFFERED SOME TRAINING A FEW MONTHS AFTER CAR IS PURCHASED IT IS TOO MUCH TO ABSORB AT CAR DELIVERY IN SHORT TIME PERIOD IN MY VIEW YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO SELL SUBSCRIPTION TO ON LINE FEATURES WITH MORE TRAINING I WIL
IPOD INTERFACE CONTROL FOR BOTH ON SCREEN AND STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS AND VOICE COMMANDS
THE NAV SYSTEM SEEMS STRAIGHT FROM 1995 ITS VERY AWKARD TO USE AND THE ROUTES IT PICKS ARE QUESTIONABLE ALSO IT S SLOW WHEN I MISS A TURN IT WANTS ME TO TAKE THE NEXT ONE IT S SO SLOW I PASS THE NEXT ONE BEFORE IT FINISHES RECALCULATING
FINDING POINTS OF INTEREST AND OTHER DESTINATIONS WITHOUT GIVING THE ADDRESS IS DIFFICULT
SOMETIMES WHEN USING BLUETOOTH PHONE THE SOUND COMING FROM ME IS MUFFLED SPEAKER
NAVIGATION SEEMS TO LACK 1 WHAT MY CURRENT SPEED LIMIT IS IT SHOWS POSTED SPEED LIMIT BUT NOT MY CURRENT 2 UPCOMING STREET NAMES MY OLD PLUG IN GARMIN DOES BOTH OF THESE FEATURES AND I LIKE SEEING BOTH ON SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT RECOGNIZE EASILY PRONOUNCEABLE NAMES EVEN WHEN SPOKEN SLOWLY AND CLEARLY I WILL THEN HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM THE TOUCH SCREEN A HANDFUL OF NAMES OF WHICH PERSON I WANTED TO CALL
THE PLACEMENT OF THE SPEAKER MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I NEED TO INCREASE MY VOICE VOLUME WHEN TALKING ON THE PHONE SO I COME ACROSS SHOUTING AT TIMES I LOVE MUSIC SO THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENT FOR SOUND QUALITY LIKE BOSE SP
REAL TIME TRAFFIC ALERTS ARE HARD TO READ AND DISTRACT FROM DRIVING
WHEN USING AUX OR USB THE SOUND IS LOW
IT RARELY RECOGNIZES MY VOICE COMMANDS MISINTERPRETS MY COMMANDS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND I FIND GOOGLEMAPS TO BE MY GO TO IN SPITE OF HOW EXCITED I HAD BEEN TO GET THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE CAR
ELIMINATE THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AFTER THE INITIAL TEASER
MY SMART PHONE SEEMS TO NOT BE CONNECTED HALF OF THE TIME WHEN I GO TO USE AND CALL OUT A CONTACT NUMBER OR WHEN I WANT TO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC I HAVE DOWNLOADED ON MY PHONE
TOO HARD TO PROGRAM RADIO CHANNELS HAVE TO READ THE BOOK TO DO IT
TOO MANY STEPS USING VOICE RECOGNITION TO PLACE A CALL OR LOCATE PLAY A SPECIFIC SONG ARTIST FROM THE JUKEBOX STILL HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW OR IF I CAN PLAY ALL SONGS BY A SINGLE ARTIST W O HAVING TO JUMP FROM ALBUM TO ALBUM MY KIA OPTIMA WOUL
 THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OFTEN DRIVES ME THROUGH LONGER ROUTES THAN EXPECTED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OFTEN DRIVES ME THROUGH LOCAL ROADS INSTEAD OF HIGHWAYS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD TRAFFIC INFORMATION SYSTEM REALLY SMALL COVER
NAVIGATION NEEDED A MUCH BETTER & USER FRIENDLY SEARCH ENGINE I VE FOUND A NUMBER OF LOCATIONS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO RETRIEVE BECAUSE THE CITY IS DIFFERENT THAN LISTED ANYWHERE ELSE AS WELL AS HAVING TO COMPLETELY GUESS HOW SOMETHING IS LISTED
NAVIGATION COULD BE SIMPLER
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE
I HAVE FOUND THAT USING THE VOICE COMMANDS IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR MOSTLY IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW TO PHRASE WHAT I AM NEEDING IT IS EASIER TO CONTROL EVERYTHING FROM THE STEERING WHEEL OR SET THINGS BEFORE STARTING A TRIP
SOUND QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING BUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY POOR ONLY THING IN THE WHOLE CAR I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
SOUND QUALITY WHEN RECEIVING A CALL FROM THE CAR IS WEAK ALSO THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE LEXICON COMPONENT ON PREVIOUS VERSION OF GENESIS YOU D THINK AT $46K YOU D GET BETTER SOUND
MAKE THE SYSTEM RECOGNIZE VOICE COMMANDS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CONFUSING IT COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
VOICE RECOGNITION HAS TROUBLE WITH MY BRITISH ACCENT
SLOW ESPECIALLY FOR NAVIGATION USE WOULD BE NICE TO BE VOICE ACTIVATED INSTEAD OF IMPUT BY HAND
TYPICALLY IT IS MY WIFE WHO IS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT WHO USES THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE BUT PEOPLE WE CALL HAVE DIFFICULTY HEARING HER WHEREAS WE DO NOT ENCOUNTER SUCH PROBLEMS WHEN WE ARE DRIVING OUR HYUNDAI GENESIS IT MAY WELL BE THE LO
BETTER ABLE TO INTERPRET VOICE COMMANDS THAT MAY NOT BE EXACTLY AS EXPECTED ALSO NOT RECOGNIZING A RESPONSE BEFORE THE BEEP
WHEN SELECTING THE PRESET RADIO STATIONS THE SPACE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN IS QUITE SMALL HAVE TO BE REALLY CAREFUL TO TOUCH THE RIGHT STATION
SEARCHING FOR SPECIFIC STORES IS NOT EASY I E THE CATEGORY SYSTEM IS POOR IT SEEMS AS IF YOU HAVE TO TYPE IN THE FULL NAME WHICH IS TEDIOUS AND DONE MUCH BETTER DIRECTLY THROUGH THE IPHONE
SOUND TO PERSON I M CALLING WHEN USING HANDS FREE SPEAKER IN VEHICLE
ISSUES WITH USB CONNECTION WITH IPHONE 6
I CAN NOT HOOK UP MY SONY MP3 PLAYER THROUGH THE USB AND SEE MY MUSIC CHOICES OVER THE RADIO SCREEN I HAVE TO USE AN AUDIO CABLE TO USE MY MP3 PLAYER
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT INSTINCTIVE TO ME AND I HAVEN T HAD TIME TO DISCOVER WHAT EVERYTHING DOES OR WHAT EACH ICON MEANS HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO READ THE GUIDEBOOK HAVE NOT VISITED OR CALLED THE DEALER EITHER I LIKE THAT I BELIEVE I HAVE FEATURES A
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PAIR IPHONE MUSIC WITH SYSTEM SELECTION OF TRACKS BETTER SOUND EQUALIZATION OF IPHONE MUSIC WITH RADIO WHEN SWITCHING FROM MEDIA TO RADIO YOU GET BLASTED IF YOU FORGET TO TURN DOWN THE VOLUME

SPEAKER SOUND QUALITY
HARD TO HEAR AND BE HEARD PHONE CALLS NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE MANY ADDRESS WE INPUT WE ARE INPUTTING INFO THAT OF ESTABLISHED OLD NEIGHBORHOODS SO IT SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM
COMMUNICATION WITH THE HANDS FREE PHONE & RADIO
I AM NOT TOO PLEASED SOUND QUALITY ADJUSTMENT
HAVE NOT USED NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET
BLUETOOTH VOICE RECOGNITION MAKES LOTS OF MISTAKES MISINTERPRETATIONS
THE SOUND QUALITY ON AVERAGE IS CLEAR BUT DOESN T SOUND ANY BETTER THAN MY WIFE S 2004 SATURN ION
SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER
THE BLUETOOTH ASKS IF YOU WANT TO MAKE THIS CALL WHEN YOU ASKS IT TO CALL SOMEONE IT IS REDUNDANT
TO MY KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN ONLY VIEW 5 POI S ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN GAS BANK FAST FOOD ETC I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A WIDER AVAILABILITY OF VIEW ABLE POI S LIKE MAYBE 10 TO 15
THE DISPLAY PANEL FACES UP AND AWAY FROM THE DRIVER I M SHORT SO THIS MAY ONLY BE AN ISSUE FOR ME BUT I FIND MYSELF LEANING OVER TOO FAR TO USE THE TOUCH DISPLAY AND MY SEAT IS PRETTY CLOSE WHERE MY KNEES ALMOST TOUCH THE STEERING COLUMN
TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY WOULD BE MUCH EASIER
JUST WISH THE BLUE LINK STUFF WOULD STOP POPPING UP EVERY TIME I START THE CAR
SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO TUNE VOICE RECOGNITION TO INDIVIDUAL PERSONS VOICE COMMANDS SOMETIMES TAKES MULTIPLE TRIES FOR FEATURE TO UNDERSTAND MY COMMAND
I WISH WHEN YOU ENDED A CALL THAT THE SCREEN WOULD GO BACK TO THE RADIO SCREEN ALSO IF YOU DON T HAVE XM RADIO THAT YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THE BUTTON ON YOUR STEERING WHEEL SO YOU DON T HAVE TO SCROLL THROUGH ALL OF THE XM STATIONS TO GET BACK TO THE
IT S STUPID THAT XM REMAINS AN OPTION EVEN IF NOT A SUBSCRIBER WHEN BROWSING THROUGH THE VARIOUS MODE OPTIONS I M REQUIRED TO CLICK THRU MODES I DON T HAVE IF YOU DON T SUBSCRIBE THEY SHOULD GO AWAY
RADIO SOUND QUALITY SOUNDS A BIT MUFFLED
I PREFER GARMIN NAVIGATION SYSTEMS VOICE RECOGNITION FOR DESTINATION NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE TO BE FAIR I DON T USE THE NAVIGATION VERY MUCH I LOVE MY RADIO  MY IPOD IS SO OLD IT WON T WORK IN THIS CAR EVEN WITH A USB CONNECTION
I DO NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM OTHER ASPECTS ARE JUST FINE
THE NAV SYSTEM ISN T THE MOST INTUITIVE ONE THAT I VE USED
TRAIN DEALER STAFF ON HOW TO SET UP VOICE COMMANDS I HAVE NO IDEA HOW ITS DONE AND THE DEALER ACTUALLY SAID IT DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL
SOFTWARE UPDATES OF NAVIGATION NOT ACCURATE AT ALL
I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SINCE I WOULD NEED TO BE TRAINED IN HOW TO USE IT
WANT MULTIPLE CD BACK
THE VOICE RECOGNITION PROGRAM COULD BE RETOOLED IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE THE COMMAND ABOUT 25% OF THE TIME JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE IT A SMALL ANNOYANCE
NEED YOUTUBE FEATURES INSTRUCTIONS
INFINITI HAS IMPROVED IN THIS AREA BUT CAN STILL USE FURTHER REFINEMENT VOICE RECOGNITION WHICH HAD BEEN HORRIBLE IS NOT WORKABLE NAVIGATION WHICH HAD BEEN STUBBORN IS NOW MORE USER FRIENDLY BUT COMPARED TO WHAT I HAVE SEEN IN MERCEDES
APPS ARE TERRIBLE DEALER PROMISED SUPPORT NON EXISTENT SUPPORT AND MINIMAL AT BEST APPS IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN CONNECT INTOUCH APP SYSTEM TO THE PHONE HAVE TRIED FOR MONTHS AND NOTHING I M A TECHY TOO INTOUCH ENT SYSTEM FREQUENTLY LAGS RESTARTS
AS I SAID BEFORE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS SOME WORK
I DO NOT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN RADIO IT IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN DRIVING AND I GET DISTRACTED BY IT I DISLIKE HAVING TO TOUCH THE ARROW BUTTON TO MOVE THE PAGE THROUGH ALL 30+ STATIONS I CAN PROGRAM ALSO LIVING IN COLD WEATHER I NEED TO BUY
VOICE RECOGNITION MENUS A BIT COMPLEX IN TERMS OF ENTERING INFORMATION FOR NAVIGATION
MAP UPDATES MANY POI NOT LISTED IN CAR BUT ARE AVAILABLE ON MY IPHONE MAP
I WISH THE NAV SYSTEM WAS EASIER TO USE
BLUE LINK>
ABOUT ONCE A WEEK IT TAKES ABOUT 5 MINUTES AFTER TURNING ON THE CAR TO RECOGNIZE THE BLUETOOTH DEVICE
SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THE BEST UNABLE TO TYPE IN THE ARTIST NAME OR NAME OF SONG WHEN USING FLASH DRIVE FOR A VEHICLE I WOULD THINK GPS WOULD BE STANDARD USING BLUE LINK TO FIND AN ADDRESS IS SLOW AND HIT AND MISS WHEN THE AUTOMATED SYSTEM
SPEAKERS COULD BE BETTER I HAD BETTER SOUND SYSTEM AND LOOK TO MY AUDIO SYSTEM WITH MY EQUINOX IT IS DUMB THAT YOU CANNOT GET BLUE LINK NAVIGATION NOT OFFERED FOR TUCSON BUT STANDARD IN MOST HYUNDAI CARS
VOICE RECOGNITION I HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF SEVERAL TIMES ON WORDS AND PHRASES IT RECOGNIZED A WEEK BEFORE
SPLIT SCREEN I WANT TO SEE THE MAP BUT I D LIKE TO SEE THE AUDIO SOURCE WITH IT I E RADIO NOT HALF THE SCREEN TAKEN BY A REMINDER ABOUT MY CRAPPY MILEAGE OR WHAT SETTING THE CLIMATE CONTROL   FAN IS ON
THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION IS NOT GREAT I AM CONSTANTLY HAVING TO REPEAT MYSELF AND IT DOES NOT CONNECT TO MY CALLS RIGHT AWAY I HAVE TO SAY HELLO MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END HEARS ME
THEY USED TO HAVE AN INTERNAL HARD DRIVE THEY DO NOT HAVE THIS ANYMORE
SPEAKERS ARE NOT LOUD SOMETIMES I LIKE TO BLAST A SONG EVEN IF I AM 57 YEARS OLD THE TREBLE OR WHATEVER IT IS THAT SELF ADJUSTS AND MAKES THE FM AM SOUND TINY AFTER ABOUT 6 SECONDS DOES NOT DO THAT WITH THE SATELLITE RADIO
APPLE CARPLAY PLEASE LAYOUT AND NESTING OF APPS IS TOO CLUNKY
HAVING USED LOTS OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM FROM WINDOWS CE   ANDROID SYSTEMS THIS DEDICATED CAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS KIND OF A DISAPPOINTMENT COMPARED TO MY EXPERIENCES THAT BEING SAID THE VOICE USED IN THIS NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER
THIS AUDIO SYSTEM HAS A SUB WOOFER AND CENTER CHANNEL WITH NO WAY TO CONTROL HOW MUCH POWER THEY RECEIVE
THE USB PORT DOESN T APPEAR TO ACTUALLY CHARGE USB DEVICES WHEN PLUGGED IN IT MAY ONLY BE TO INTERFACE WITH AN IPOD WHICH I DON T OWN

THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE AUDIO MUSIC SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED
MORE USER FRIENDLY FIND NAVIGATION SYSTEM HARD TO USE
THE NAVIGATION NEEDS TO FIND MORE BETTER POINTS OF INTEREST WHEN USING THE VOICE COMMAND
I HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET SO NO COMMENT FOR THAT SIRIUS RADIO AND CD PLAYER BOTH SOUND VERY GOOD
MORE APPS APPLE ICAR CONNECTIVITY BETTER SOUND QUALITY OF BOSE SYSTEM AT LOW VOLUME
THE 2 APPS AVAILABLE FOR INTOUCH ARE A JOKE WHO WANTS FACEBOOK IN THEIR CAR 2 APPS ONLY INFINITI SHOULD EITHER DEVELOP THE SYSTEM OR RETIRE IT
THE AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABLE TO DISPLAY NON ENGLISH CHARACTERS

HAVING DUAL SCREENS AND A CLEANER INTERFACE WHEN USING TWO SYSTEMS
KNOBS TOO SMALL FOR RADIO XM RADIO IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL
IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO LOAD MORE THEN ONE CD AS IT IS I DON T USE IT BECAUSE LOADING AND UNLOADING WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE SAFELY A PLACE TO STORE CD WOULD ALSO BE USEFUL

BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IS JUST OK SOUND QUALITY IS OK
DISPLAY IS OLD TECHNOLOGY
WOULD PREFER BUTTONS & KNOBS AS IN OLDER VEHICLES TO CHANGE STATIONS AND VOLUME MUCH QUICKER AND SAFER  I DO NOT CONSIDER THIS RELATIVELY NEW USE OF SCREEN DRIVEN SYSTEMS FOR FUNCTIONS NEEDED WHILE DRIVING TO BE AN IMPROVEMENT  I WOULD NOT HA
THE INPUTTING OF DIRECTIONS IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SUCKS IT DOESN T ALWAYS LET YOU FINISH TYPING IN THE STREET NAME BEFORE IT GIVES YOU CHOICES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR DESTINATION
HONDA APP SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERFACE WITH PHONES OTHER THAN THE IPHONE 5 AND NEWER

I DON T USE THE PHONE WHEN DRIVING I LISTEN TO TALK RADIO
THE POI DATABASE SHOULD BE MORE EXTENSIVE SO FAR EXCEPT FOR HONDA DEALERS I HAVE NOT HAD A MATCH FOR ANY PHONE NUMBERS
THE HONDALINK APP SEEMS TO ONLY WORK WITH IPHONE WE HAVE WINDOWS AND ANDROID DEVICES SO WE ARE UNABLE TO USE MANY OF THE FEATURES
ENABLE THE F***ING HDMI PORT INPUT WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION I JUST WANT TO MIRROR GOOGLE MAPS AND MY OBDII PORT MONITOR
IT S CLEAR THAT OUR VAN HAS SPACES DESIGNED TO ACCOMMODATE ADDITIONAL FEATURES LIKE NAVIGATION INCLUDING 2 SEPARATE DISPLAY SCREENS HOWEVER IN THE ABSENCE OF THESE FEATURES WE HAVE REDUNDANT AND CONFUSING SYSTEMS FOR CONTROLLING THE AUDIO HVA
LOSS OF PANDORA CONNECTIVIY IS FRUSTRATING IT MIGHT BE MY PHONE

AGAIN A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN PROGRAMS
THE SUB CHARGING ETC CORDS ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCESS WHILE DRIVING AND DIFFICULT IN THE ARM REST
NAVIGATION STANDARD I USE MY PHONE FOR NAVIGATION AND DON T USE IT ENOUGH TO PAY FOR IT BUT IF IT WAS STANDARD IN THE EX PACKAGE I WOULD USE IT AND IT WOULD PROBABLY BE SAFER

IT CANNOT RECOGNIZE MY VOICE COMMAND
CONNECTING IPHONE WHILE NOT IN PARK
SPLIT SCREEN TO SEE MUSIC AND MAP OR PHONE AND MAP
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT IN A USABLE STATE EVEN WHEN COMMANDS ARE RECOGNIZED THERE ARE SO MANY STEPS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE ANY TASK IF I HAD KNOWN THIS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DEAL BREAKER
RADIO CONTROLS ARE SMALLER THAN THE ZONE HEATING CONTROLS OFTEN ACCIDENTLY REACH FOR TEMP CONTROL WHEN MEANING TO REACH AUDIO CONTROL
THE CONTROLS ARE FAR AWAY FROM THE DRIVER I AM 6 AND HAVE TO LEAN OVER TO CHANGE THE STATIONS I HAVEN T QUITE GOT DOWN THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO DO WHAT I WANT THEM TO

AUDIO QUALITY WHEN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ON AND USING THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH CONNECTED PHONE
WHILE IN MOTION DIFFICULT TO USE TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS

BLUETOOTH FEELS REALLY CLUNKY NICE THAT THEY INCLUDED BUT IT REALLY NEEDED MORE WORK TO MAKE FOR A UI THAT S AS INTUITIVE AS THE IPHONE DEVICE IT S SYNCHED TO THAT DISCONNECT IN TECHNOLOGY UI SLICKNESS IS A BIT JARRING
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PURCHASE NAVIGATION PACKAGE TO OBTAIN MULTI DISK CD PLAYER
WHEN ENTERING ADDRESSES IN THE NAVIGATION PROVIDE THE OPTION TO EDIT THE NAMES NUMBERS OF STREETS WITHOUT HAVING THE DELETE THE ENTIRE ENTRY YOU CANNOT MOVE THE CURSOR TO A SPECIFIC LOCATION TO EDIT YOU HAVE TO DELETE THE ENTIRE ENTRY FOR EXAMP
NO USB JACK NAVIGATION LOW GRADE AUDIO SYSTEM
THE RADIO AND NAVIGATION VOLUME IS A BIT AWKWARD TO ADJUST SINCE THEY ARE BOTH TOGETHER
ALL VEHICLE S SHOULD COME WITH BACKUP CAMERAS BUILD IN THE PRICE
VERY BLAND I WAS TOLD THIS WAS LOADED MOST VEHICLES COME STANDARD WITH HANDS FREE NOT A HUGE DEAL BUT IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE NICE
DOES NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND WHICH IT DID
I WISH THE COMPASS HAS THE SAME FEATURES A JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE HAS THE STEERING WHEEL AUDIO CONTROL AND THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM
FOR THE PRICE OF CAR THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS NOT VERY NICE I HAD A NISSAN SENTRA THAT HAD NAVIGATION SYSTEM BLUETOOTH AND SEROUS RADIO A LOT LESS MONEY THE CAR IS A GREAT RUNNING CAR IM JUST VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE AUDIO SYTEM WHEN YOU PAY ALMOST

I KNOW CD S ARE GOING OUT OF STYLE BUT I STILL WOULD HAVE LIKED ONE AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT
VOLUME ADJUSTMENT OF NAVIGATION AND PHONE NEEDS TO BE INDEPENDENT OF RADIO
BLUTOOTH CAPABILITIES WOULD HELP ME CONNECT ME PHONE
SOME TROUBLE WITH THE VOICE RECOGNITION UNDERSTANDING MY COMMANDS
SOMETIMES THE BUILT IN BLUETOOTH DOESN T PICK UP THE CALLS BEING MADE AND I HAVE TO TURN OFF THE BLUETOOTH FROM MY PHONE THEN TURN IT BACK ON FOR IT TO WORK

THE VOICE COMMAND RECOGNITION OF TEMPERATURE SETTINGS IS NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE AND I CAN T GET IT TO WORK WITH THE HEATED STEERING WHEEL SETTING OTHER THAN THAT IT S FINE
SPEAKERS GOOD WHEN USING BLUETOOTH ITS MUMBLED AND CUTS OUT MY LAST CAR WAS BETTER IN THAT ASPECT I WISH THE SCREEN FOR RADIO WAS BIGGER BY JUST A LITTLE
BETTER SPEAKERS FOR BASIC MODEL JUST BECAUSE I DON T WANT SATELLITE DOESN T MEAN THAT I DON T WANT GOOD SOUND
VOICE RECOGNITION BETTER USB STANDARD WOULD BE GREAT
IT WOULD BE NICE THAT YOU COULD PROGRAM MORE CHANNELS THAN WHAT IS STANDARD ON THE RADIO SYSTEM HAVING MORE THAN 12 CHANNELS TO PROGRAM WOULD BE GREAT SINCE HAVING SIRIUS XM RADIO HAS A BUNCH OF CHANNELS I WOULD LIKE TO LISTEN TO AND IT IS A SA
WISH MY PHONE WAS ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC WIRELESS MUST USE AUX CHORD
THE VOICE ACTIVATED COMMANDS SHOULD BE LISTED ON A QUICK TIP GUIDE THAT CAN BE EASILY ACCESSED BY THE DRIVER BUTTON LABELS SHOULD ALIGN BETTER TO VOICE COMMANDS
NO BLUETOOTH OPTION ON ENTRY LEVEL VEHICLE IN IS A SHAME
CAR WAS ORDERED WITH BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY BUT NOT DELIVERED WITH IT SO IT WAS INSTALLED AFTERMARKET AFTERMARKET INSTALLATION USES AN UGLT MICROPHONE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EMBEDDED IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR IF IT WERE DONE PROPERLY BY THE FACTORY
BLUETOOTH SHOULD BE A MANDATORY OPTION IN ALL VEHICLES
I ONLY HAVE AN AUDIO SYSTEM
I HAVE THE ALPINE SPEAKERS AND SUBWOOFER LOVE THEM
ADDING A NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I D LIKE THE PHONE APP TO HAVE ACCESS TO SYSTEM SETTINGS AND CONTROLS NO REASON YOU CAN T HAVE THE WHOLE INFO SYSTEM ON A SMARTPHONE REMOTELY FROM THE CAR
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS WORK ALSO I SHOULDN T HAVE TO PAY TO LOG INTO PANDORA AND BE ABLE TO CONTROL IT VIA THE DASH I WAS ABLE TO DO THIS FOR FREE IN MY CHEVY AND MY TOYOTA ITS ALMOST PETTY FOR YOU TO CHARGE ME TO CONTROL MY APPS THROUGH THE

SUB WOOFER NEEDS MOVED
WIFE USES COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
RESOLUTION ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS VERY POOR AT BEST WHEN YOU ARE PAYING OVER $40K FOR A VEHICLE WITH AN OPTIONAL NAVIGATION I EXPECT BETTER QUALITY UNIT
ABILITY FOR PASSENGERS TO INPUT NAV DIRECTIONS WHILE DRIVING
GET RID OF THE HOME GROWN NAVIGATION APP AND USE GOOGLE MAPS INSTEAD EVEN IF YOU USE DATA FROM MY PHONE THE WAY YOU HAVE TO INTERACT WITH NAVIGATION IS SO BACKWARD AND NOT HOW ANYONE INTERACTS WITH ANY TECHNOLOGY ANYWHERE
IT TAKES A WHILE TO CONNECT TO A CALL WHEN YOU PRESS THE UCONNECT BUTTON
WISH I UPGRADED TO THE NAV RADIO SYSTEM WITH CELL PHONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
SOMETIMES HARD TO RECOGNIZE WHAT I AM SAYING WHEN ATTEMPTING TO USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION
AN ISSUE I HAVE IS HAVING THE VEHICLE COMPLETELY STOPPED TO USE THE NAVIGATION IS FRUSTRATING AT TIMES I UNDERSTAND IT S FOR SAFETY PURPOSES BUT I FEEL MY PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENTER USE SUCH FUNCTIONS FOR ME WHILE I AM DRIVING I HAVE COMM
INTEGRATED SATELLITE RADIO
THE UCONNECT SAYS TO PRESS THE PHONE BUTTON TO END A CALL BUT THIS DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK PRESSING THE RED END BUTTON ON THE DISPLAY SHOULD BE THE DESCRIBED METHOD
I HAVE A UCONNECT 430N AND IT HAS LOW RESOLUTION AND A POOR USER INTERFACE ESPECIALLY WHEN BROWSING RADIO STATIONS AND MUSIC ON THE HDD
VOICE COMMAND IS UP AND DOWN
PROVIDE BETTER QUICK START INSTRUCTIONS FOR VOICE COMMAND FEATURE MAKE SWITCHING FROM HANDSFREE TO PRIVATE MODE ON THE PHONE EASIER AND MORE INTUITIVE PUT IN BETTER SPEAKERS ON THE BASE MODEL TO DROWN OUT ALL THE ROAD NOISE BETTER YET CUT D
MORE BASS HIGHER WATTAGE
SYSTEM IS VERY DELAYED AS FAR AS RESPONSE IF YOU PUSH A BUTTON OR MOVE BETWEEN FM PRESETS SOMETIMES THE SYSTEM FREEZES THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE PHONE CALL IS JUST AVERAGE SOUNDS VERY TINNY
THE SYSTEM DOESN T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND MY COMMANDS WHEN BLUETOOTH IS CONNECTED IT S ALSO SOMETIMES HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSON YOU ARE TALKING TO WHEN IT COMES OVER BLUETOOTH I M NOT SURE HOW TO IMPROVE THAT THOUGH
AS PERTAINING TO VOLUME ON BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE I USUALLY AM COMFORTABLE LISTENING TO RADIO AT ABOUT A 7 VOLUME HOWEVER WHEN MAKING CALLS I HAVE TO HAVE TO TURN RADIO VOLUME TO 30 HOWEVER AS OF YET I HAVE NOT INVESTIGATED TO SEE IF THERE
THE MOST HELPFUL WOULD BE HAVING THE CONTROLS NOT ON THE TOUCH SCREEN
WE CHOSE NOT TO HAVE THE UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM AT THIS TIME I WAS ONLY CONCERNED WITH HANDS FREE PHONE AND TO BE ABLE TO PLAY MUSIC FROM MY PHONE SO I M VERY HAPPY WITH THE SYSTEM THAT CAME WITH THE CAR I JUT WOULD PREFER TO HAVE BETTER SPEAKER
VOICE RECOGNITION IS SLOW TO RESPOND AND HAS A HARD TIME HEARING THE DRIVER SPEAK
EVERY TIME YOU CONNECT YOUR PHONE WITH USB IT DEFAULTS TO START PLAYING MEDIA ON THE DEVICE I JUST WANT TO CHARGE THE PHONE I DONT WANT TO PLAY MY TABATA SONGS FROM MY BOOTCAMP CLASS LET ME CHOOSE ON THE SCREEN IF I WANT TO PLAY SONGS
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM COULD BE BETTER
NEED BETTER VOLUME CONTROL ON BLUETOOTH

I DID NOT REALIZE THERE WAS NOT A CD PLAYER WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR I GUESS I JUST ASSUMED VERY DISAPPOINTED SINCE I LOVE TO LISTEN TO MY CD S
USING THE TOUCH SCREEN SHOULDN T BE DONE WHILE DRIVING
I FEEL THAT IT COULD HAVE A BETTER COMPATIBILITY WITH APPLE PRODUCTS I VE SWITCHED BETWEEN AUXILIARY AT FIRST TO BLUETOOTH ALWAYS WENT BACK TO AUXILIARY WHEN BLUETOOTH FAILED ALSO
I WISH IT HAD BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IT WAS AVAILABLE AS EN OPTION ONLY IF IT CAME EQUIPPED THAT WAY AND IT ISN T READILY ADDED AFTERMARKET
WE VERY MUCH WANT THE SYSTEM TO BE UPDATED TO APPLE CAR PLAY WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE I WANT IT ASAP
SOUND QUALITY IS BAD BUT USAGE OF THE AUDIO FEATURES IS GREAT
HONESTLY IF I HAD THE RESOURCES I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE MODEL WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN BECAUSE IT HAD ALL THE APPLICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS THE MODEL I PURCHASED HAS A DECENT SYSTEM BUT YOU CAN TELL MORE TIME WAS SPENT WITH THE OTHER MODEL S SYSTE
BETTER QUALITY SOUND AND BETTER QUALITY MICROPHONE
I DO NOT HAVE NAVIGATION
NEED BETTER LIGHTING ON RADIO STATION DISPLAY
THE RECEPTION OF THE FM RADIO SIGNAL
WHEN I GET A PHONE CALL WHILE DRIVING IT RINGS SO LOUDLY THAT EVERYBODY IN THE CAR IS STARTLED AND JUMPS EVEN IF I HAD THE RADIO TURNED DOWN AVERAGE THE INCOMING CALL IS JUST TOO LOUD
ADD THE OPTION OF EASY DISCONNECTION FROM HANDS FREE COMMUNICATIONS DONT ALWAYS WANT EVERYONE IN THE VEH TO HEAR MY CONVERSATIONS
I REALLY NEED TO TAKE THE TIME TO FIGURE OUT THE BLUETOOTH I M NOT GOOD WITH TECHNOLOGY
I FIND THAT I KEEP HITTING OR ENGAGING VOICE RECOGNITION UNINTENTIONALLY PERHAPS IT SHOULD BE IN A SPOT ON STEERING WHEEL HARDER TO GET TO
MY PREVIOUS EX MODEL HAD INFINITY SOUND SYSTEM STANDARD IN THE PACKAGE I BOUGHT THE NEW EX DOES NOT YOU HAVE TO BUY THE NEXT MODEL UP
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS GOOD MY PHONE IPHONE HAS OCCASSIONALLY NOT CONNECTED
VOICE RECOGNITION I WOULD RECOMMEND HAVING THE SALES MAN HELP SET THESE THINGS UP SIMILAR TO HOW THEY HELP YOU CONNECT YOUR PHONE
THE TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS TO BE LARGER AND IT DOES NOT SAVE MY FAVORITES IN THE CONTACTS SECTION LIKE IT SHOULD IT ONLY SAVES THEM WHILE MY PHONE IS CONNECTED IF I SWITCH TO ANOTHER PHONE THEN SWITCH BACK MY FAVORITES IN MY CONTACTS ARE GONE
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE INCOMING PHONE CALL VOLUME IS WAY TOO LOUD DON T KNOW HOW TO LOWER IT IT IS SO LOUD IT COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT
WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE ABILITY CONTROL THE AUDIO THAT IS SOURCED FROM MY CELL PHONE VIA THE CAR S DASHBOARD SCREEN
VOICE COMMANDS ARE NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZED AND REQUIRES THAT NO ONE IS TALKING IN THE VEHICLE ABOUT BLASTED MY EARDRUMS THE FIRST TIME AN INCOMING CALL CAME IN SET THE DEFAULT VOLUME ON THE LOWER END I D RATHER MAKE IT LOUDER THAN JUMP OUT OF
WHILE I LIKE THE SIRIUS XM SYSTEM I WILL NOT USE IT BEYOND THE TRIAL PERIOD DUE TO THE POOR MARKETING STRATEGY AND EXCESSIVE COSTS OF THE SERVICE A BETTER OPTION WOULD BE TO OFFER THE RECEIVER AS AN EASILY INSTALLED OPTION FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT W
SATELLITE VIEW IN NAVIGATION
THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND UNDERSTANDING OF COMMANDS COULD BE BETTER
I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT YET HOW TO USE THE USB PORT YET

WHEN USING BLUETOOTH IT IS DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ME CLEARLY THEY SAY THEY HEAR STATIC
GREAT ON MUSIC BUT ALL VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS SHORT OF EXPECTATION SLOW TO RESPOND AND OFTEN NOT ACCURATE
HEADPHONES ARE COMPLICATED TO USE FOR KIDS ON 2ND ROW

NAVIGATION COULD BE SIMPLIER TO USE
NEEDS A WIFI HOTSPOT
CUT DOWN STEPS FOR MAKING CALLS THROUGH BLUETOOTH IT IS EASIER TO USE MY SMART PHONE TO CONNECT BY ASKING SERI TO CALL MY CONTACT
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF SEARCHING LOCATIONS IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WAS EASIER AND MORE EFFECTIVE
THE JAG ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY AND SCREEN COULD USE AN UPGRADE A BIT BEHIND OTHER MANUFACTURERS BUT STILL VERY GOOD
BLUETOOTH CALLING ISN T THE MOST CLEAR AND THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM SCREEN QUALITY IS GRAINY
THE FIDELITY OF THE SYSTEM IS NOT UP TO THE STANDARD OF THE BOSE SYSTEM IN OUR GMC YUKON DENALI XL
THE BLUETOOTH VOICE SYSTEM HAS TOO MANY STEPS AND TOO MANY QUESTIONS AND CONFIRMATIONS I HAVE DRIVEN OTHER VEHICLES WHERE ALL I HAD TO DO WAS SAY CALL [NAME] HOME OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT AND IT DID IT ON THIS VEHICLE AND OTHER JAGS THA
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CLUNKY TO USE COMPARE TO EASE OF USING GOOGLE MAPS
NAVIGATION MAP DISPLAY GUIDANCE COULD BE SIMPLER
PHONE CALLS AUDIO QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED
THE Q40 USES THE SAME TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS USED IN THE G35 AND G37 WHICH IS MORE THAN 6 YEARS OLD
MULTI DISC CD SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE MY I PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH AND THE PLAYLISTS AND THE ARTISTS WOULD BE DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN THIS IS ONLY POSSIBLE IF THE I PHONE IS CONNECTED TO A USB PORT I CANNOT SEE THE LISTS IF I AM LISTENING TO MUSIC VIA T

NOT LOUD ENOUGH AND NO INTERNET MUSIC APPS
WHILE I HAVE USED THE VOICE CONTROL I PREFER THE TOUCH SCREEN
I HAVE BEEN TOLD I SOUND AS IF I AM IN A TUNNEL WHEN I UTILIZE THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADD MORE RADIO STATIONS SO I WOULD BE ABLE TO CHANGE FROM STEERING WHEEL INSTEAD OF MANUALLY CHANGING IT ON THE RADIO
NAVIGATION ROUTING IS QUESTIONABLE
BLUETOOTH AUDIO IS HORRIBLE I HATE THAT THE USB CONNECTION TO MY IPHONE AUTOPLAYS THE MUSIC STORED ON THE IPHONE ENTERING AN ADDRESS INTO THE NAV SYSTEM IS TIME CONSUMING AND NOT INTUITIVE
BLUETOOTH IS NOT GOOD
THE IN CONTROL APP IS NOT WELL DESIGNED LUCKILY I CAN PLAY THE MUSIC FROM MY IPHONE VIA BLUETOOTH BECAUSE THE APP INTERFACE IS AWKWARD NOT INTUITIVE REQUIRES THE IPHONE TO BE ON AND OPEN TO THE IN CONTROL APP AND THE IN CONTROL APP DOES NOTHI

I USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ONLY RARELY BU THE LAYOUT IS CONFUSING AND THE DIRECTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN INACCURATE IT HAS FREQUENTLY TOLD ME TO BEAR RIGHT WHEN THERE IS NO CURVE OR BEND IN THE ROAD AND THESE ARE MAJOR ROADS IN A MAJOR US CI
NEEDS BETTER SPEAKERS AND IMPROVED BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
IT S HARD TO DRIVE AND CHANGE THE RADIO TO DIFFERENT CATEGORIES ON SATALITE RADIO EVERYTHING IS TOUCH SCREEN SO YOU HAVE TO TRY AND DRIVE AND READ THE SCREEN AT THE SAME TIME
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS GOOD BUT HAVE BEEN IN CARS THAT ARE EASIER TO INPUT DESTINATIONS
OVERALL SOLID SYSTEM BUT NOT UP TO SNUFF FOR A HIGH END CAR ESPECIALLY THE NAVIGATION AND CONTROLS
THE SPEAKERS ARE TERRIBLE VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY
INCONTROL APPS IN OTS CURRENT STATE IS USELESS SCREEN TRANSITIONS ARE SLOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE APPS ARE RUNNING ON MY PHONE BUT I HAVE A BRAND NEW GALAXY NOTE 4 THERE SHOULD BE NO DELAY IN PROCESSING THE FEW APPS THAT ARE AVAILABLE CURRENTLY
FOR A NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEWLY INTRODUCED IN ONE OF THE MOST MOST POORLY DESIGNED DATE SYSTEMS I HAVE ENCOUNTERED IN A LUXURY AUTOMOBILE
TOUCH SCREEN IS DISTRACTING WHEN OPERATING AND DRIVING AT THE SAME TIME THE BMW I DRIVE IN COMPARISON IS MUCH BETTER EASIER TO OPERATE WHILE DRIVING
VERY USER UNFRIENDLY RADIO CONTROLS PASSE SCREENS FOR XM RADIO

THE NAV CENTER FOR THIS CAR DOES NOT ALLOW FOR REAL TIME TRAFFIC INFORMATION TO BE SHOWN WHICH IS THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH IT GREAT SYSTEM BUT HUGE WEAKNESS OF SYSTEM
EASE OF PROGRAMMING CELL PHONES ALSO LINK 2 PHONES AT SAME TIME
THE JOYSTICK ISN T THE EASIEST THING TO USE AND YOU HAVE TO FIND AND SEARCH FOR INDIVIDUAL LETTERS IT WOULD BE EASY IF IT COULD DO VOICE RECOGNITION
THE ABILITY TO SWITCH FROM ONE DEVICE TO ANOTHER EASIER AND MORE SIMPLISTIC ALSO THE VOLUME IS BETTER WHEN USING A IPOD INSTEAD OF THE RADIO
GRITTY DISPLAY WEAK SOUND SYSTEM ESPECIALLY FOR IT BEING THE PREMIUM VERSION NAVIGATION IS CLUNKY AND YOU CANNOT CONTROL IT WHEN DRIVING HAVE TO PULL OVER IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE DESTINATION OR ANYTHING
THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND AUDIO OPTIONS DISPLAY COULD BE BETTER

VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION STILL IS DIFFICULT ADDRESS ENTRY TAKE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS
OCCASIONAL LAG IN THE NAVIGATION WHEN MOVING FROM ITEM TO ITEM AND LOADING DIFFERENT SCREENS
DOESN T ALWAYS RECOGNIZE VOICE COMMANDS
A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE EASIER THAN A MOUSE
WHEN CONNECTING TO BLUETOOTH AND USING VOICE RECOGNITION I DO NOT LIKE THAT SO MANY CHOICES COME ON THE SCREEN AND THEN I AM ASKED TO CHOOSE ONE TO CALL I DON T UNDERSTAND WHY ALL THESE OTHER NAMES APPEAR
OLD FASHION CHANNEL BUTTONS WOULD BE QUICKER AND EASIER THAN THE NEW TECHNOLOGY
THE RADIO STATION SCAN FEATURE DOES NOT EXIST AT LEAST THAT I COULD EASILY FIND AS A RESULT I HAVE TO MANUALLY SEARCH THROUGH STATIONS USING THE STATION DIAL
VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY POOR STOPPED USING IT QUALITY OF SPEAKER SYSTEM IS BELOW PAR FOR THE COST OF THE VEHICLE
MAKE IT EASIER TO SWITCH THE NAV SCREED FROM MAPS TO RADIO AND EQUALLY IMPT MAKE IT EASIER TO MOVE THROUGH THE PRE SET STATIONS THAT CLICKER THING SUCKS
SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT UNDERSTAND HAVE TO REPEAT SEVERAL TIMES AND ITS USUALLY STILL WRONG
WHEN REACHING YOUR DESTINATION INDICATE ON THE LEFT OR ON THE RIGHT
VOICE RECOGNITION IS THE WORST I VE EVER HAD JUMPING FROM ONE RADIO STATION TO ANOTHER IS INCONVENIENT WITHOUT SWITCHING OFF THE NAVIGATION MAP AND GOING TO THE RADIO MENU
FOR SOME REASON THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC DOESN T SEEM TO BE UP TO DATE AND SOMETIMES I ALMOST WONDER IF THE TRAFFIC NOTIFICATION ON THE MAP RED OR YELLOW TRAFFIC IS ACTUALLY LIT UP ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE ROAD FOR EXAMPLE WHEN I AM DRIVING SO
EASIER MORE RELIABLE INTEGRATION OF IPHONE INTO THE TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
MANY TIMES WHEN TRYING TO USE VOICE COMMANDS FAILED TO WORK PROPERLY
DESTINATION SEARCHING SPEED IS LIMITED AND VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH STILL USING GOOGLE MAP AS MY PRIMARY GPS
CONNECTIVITY WITH IPOD
I HAVE BEEN TOLD NOT BY DEALER TECH THAT SHOULDN T CHARGE PHONE USING USB BECAUSE ET AN IPOD ERROR AND TURNS OFF MUSIC SO NEED TO CHARGE PHONE USING CIGARETTE LIGHTER ADAPTER THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE WHEN THERE ARE 2 USB SLOTS IN THE VEHICLE ALSO C
CONNECTING TO PANDORA IS SOMETIMES A CHALLENGE IT CAN TAKE A LONG TIME AND IT S PRETTY SENSITIVE IF YOU DON T DO EVERYTHING JUST RIGHT ALSO THE LEXUS ENFORM SYSTEM PRETTY MUCH STINKS PARTICULARLY THE REMOTE START FUNCTIONALITY BARELY EVER WORKS
NAVI NEEDS ALOT OF WORK
MAKE SEPARATE FAVORITES LIST FOR FM RADIO AND SATELLITE RADIO
I WOULD LIKE THE MOUSE REPLACED BY TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS
HOW TO TELL THE NAV SYSTEM THE WAY YOU WANT TO NAVIGATE TO YOUR DESTINATION E G VIA FREEWAY OR MOST DIRECT SHORTEST ROUTE OR TOLL ROADS NO TOLL ROADS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM S DYNAMIC TRAFFIC ROUTING IS SUB PAR TO MY JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE VERY DISSATISFIED WITH NEWER VEHICLE AND POORER PERFORMANCE CHRYSLERS NON LUXURY U CONNECT IS BETTER THAN LUXURY LEXUS LEVEL SAD
I DO NOT USE THE CONNECTIVITY ITEMS OR EVEN HAVE FACEBOOK IF YOU COULD MAKE IT A SECURE WIFI HOTSPOT FOR MY DEVICES THAT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE
HAVE PRESETS AVAILABLE WITHOUT USING TOUCHSCREEN I MAY WANT MY NAVIGATION UP ON THE TOUCHSCREEN AND THE ONLY WAY TO MOVE QUICKLY TO A DESIRED PRESET CHANNEL WILL BE TO MOVE TO THE AUDIO SCREEN FLIP THROUGH THE PAGES AND SELECT MY CHANNEL TOO
PHONE SYSTEM COULD BE EASIER TO OPERATE
MICROPHONE IS OFTEN TIMES NOT LEGIBLE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ALMOST COMPLETELY LOCKED DOWN WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION BUT VERY ODD PORTIONS NOT USEFUL ARE USEABLE WHILE IN MOTION IT WOULD BE GREAT IF A SENSOR SIMILAR TO THE SEATBELT SENSOR COULD NOTIFY THE NAV SYSTEM THAT
VOICE COMMAND AND USB CONNECTION
PEOPLE OFTEN CAN T HEAR ME AND I HAVE TO SPEAK VERY LOUDLY WHEN TALKING VIA BLUETOOTH STOCK SPEAKERS FEEL AVERAGE FOR A LUXURY CAR THEY GET FUZZY SOUNDING WITH HIGH BASS AT MEDIUM TO HIGH VOLUME
NAV APP AND VOICE RECOGNITION IS VIRTUALLY USELESS BECAUSE IT RARELY WORKS
MENU DOESN T COMPARE TO THE BMW IDRIVE SYS FOR BEING LEXUS THEY WENT OUT CHEAP IN DESIGNING THE WAY YOU MOVE AROUND THE MENU DOESN T EVEN MAKE SENSE HOPEFULLY AFTER BUYING THIS CAR NEW LEXUS WILL FIND A WAY TO PERFORM AND LOOK WILL
NATURAL VOICE RECOGNITION   SIRI BUTTON   APPLE CARPLAY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T ALWAYS RECOGNIZE ADDRESSES
CONNECTIVITY ISSUES NEED TO BE WORKED OUT AND IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD SOMETIME THE SPEED AFTER YOU SAY A COMMAND IS TOO QUICK TO ASK YOU WHAT YOU SAY AND IT GETS FRUSTRATING AS IN YOU ARE TRYING TO TELL IT WHAT YOU WANT AND ITS ALREADY ASKING P
PANDORA SOMETIMES CONNECTS SLOW THE INTEGRATED APPS COULD BE EASIER TO ACCESS CAN ALWAYS USE MORE INTEGRATION TO SMARTPHONE AND DATA SERVICES I WISH YOU COULD TALK YOUR TEXT MESSAGES THE CANNED RESPONSES ARE LAME
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS SOME SERIOUS WORK THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ARE OUTSTANDING AS ARE THE INTERFACES WITH EXTERNAL UNITS SMARTPHONE IPOD ETC BUT TRYING TO USE IT BY VOICE IS A REAL BURDEN ONE NIT PICK PLEASE MODIFY THE PRESE
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM SELDOM WORKS CORRECTLY EXCEPT WHEN THE VEHICLE IS STOPPED AND QUIET WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION VOICE CONTROL FREQUENTLY COMES BACK WITH PARDON OR GIVES A RESPONSE THAT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REQUEST
ALLOW ENTRY OF ZIP CODE TO DETERMINE CITY AND STATE HERTZ NEVER LOST HAS THE BEST NAVIGATION SYSTEM ALLOW PASSENGER TO ENTER ADDRESS WHEN CAR IS DRIVING
LET ME USE A TOUCH SCREEN INSTEAD OF THE STUPID MOUSE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
THE TRAFFIC SYSTEM IS LOUSY THE GUIDANCE SYSTEM IS SUB PAR VERY DISAPPOINTING AT THIS PRICE POINT ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS OK BUT THE LOOK AND FEEL IS VERY DATED
ENTERING A DESTINATION WHEN VEHICLE IS MOVING PASSENGERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
MARK LEVINSON SYSTEM WAS NOWHERE AS GOOD AS SYSTEM IN MY LEXUS VERY DISAPPOINTING
IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO ACCESS THE TURN LIST ON THE NAVIGATION IT SHOULD NOT REQUIRE MULTIPLE STEPS I USED TO DRIVE A HONDA ODYSSEY AND THE NAVIGATION WAS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND UNLESS YOU HAVE A TECH EXPERT DRIVING WITH YOU
THE ONLY TWO ISSUES I HAVE IS WHEN I GO TO USE THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND IT GOES TO CONNECT WITH THE CALLER IT WILL HAVE A ONE TO THREE SECOND BLAST OF MUSIC AND THEN IT WILL CONNECT WITH THE CALLER ALSO I CAN NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO
SOUND SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED I HAVE AN ACUR WITH THE BOSE SYSTEM IN IT AND IT IS A SUPERIOR SOUND SYSTEM TO THE INFINITY SYSTEM
LOVE THE HANDS FREE PHONE
VOICE RECOGNITION NOT TO HAVE TO REPEAT OVER AND OVER WHEN NOT UNDERSTANDING THE COMMAND
MY VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE A CD PLAYER FOUND THIS STRANGE I WOULD THINK THAT THIS WOULD BE A STANDARD DEVICE
THE SPEED OF THE VOICE COMMANDS COULD BE FASTER
USING THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE WITH PHONE DOES NOT ALWAYS TRANSMIT VOICE WHEN WINDOWS ARE OPEN
THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVED VOICE RECOGNITION HAVING SAID THAT IT IS REMARKEABLE HOW WELL IT CURRENTLY WORKS WE BOUGHT THE SOUL + AND THE USER INTERFACE ALTHOUGH VERY FUNCTIONAL SEEMS A BIT DATED MONOCHROME ORANGE AND BLACK SCREEN
THE BLUETOOTH HANDS FREE CALLING SEEMS TO CUT OUT EVERY FEW SECONDS
BLUETOOTH MORE RELIABLE ALLOW PASSENGER TO USE ALL ASPECTS OF THE SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING
THE MODEL COULD HAVE TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY
NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE SPEAKER SYSTEM I CAM FROM A BOSE AND A HARMON KARDON SO IT S A BIT DIFFERENT
AS MENTIONED I DO NOT USE NOR NEED SIRIUS RADIO I DO NOT HAVE A CD PLAYER AND THAT I WOULD HAVE USED
THEY COULD PUT THE TV SCREEN IN EACH OF THE HEAD REST RATHER THAN ONE SMALL SCREEN IN THE CENTER OF THE VEHICLE
THE NAV SYSTEM ISN T AS GOOD AS THE ONE WE HAD ON OUR FLEX IT TAKES YOU THE WRONG WAY MANY TIMES AND SOMETIMES DOESNT HAVE ADDRESSES WE VE HAD TO USE OUR IPADS TO FIND PLACES WHILE IN THE CAR SEARCHING FOR PLACES ALSO THE WAY IT GIVES YOU A
THE PRESET RADIO STATIONS NEED TO BE EASIER TO USE I LIKE THE OLD STYLE PERMANENT BUTTONS 1 6 THAT ARE ALWAYS THERE DON T LIKE SEARCHING THE SCREEN FOR THEM AND ONLY 3 SHOW AT A TIME
NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ADDRESS EVEN ATTEMPTING TYPING IT IN
NAVIGATION DOES NOT OFFER YOU TO TYPE A WORD AND LOOK IT UP
HAVEN T YET USED THE PHONE SYNC FEATURES AUDIO QUALITY I WOULD SAY IS NOT SO GOOD
I WISH THERE WERE STILL BUTTONS TO CLICK ON A PRE SET RADIO STATION I KNOW WE CAN PRE SET STATIONS AND USE THE UP DOWN THING IN THE STEERING WHEEL BUT I WISH I COULD EASILY PRESS A NUMBER BUTTON TO QUICKLY GET TO THE PRE SET STATION I WANT VS H
WONT DOWNLOAD CONTACTS FROM SAMSUNG GALAXY 3 PHONE CANT USE VOICE RECOGNITION TO CALL USING CONTACT NAMES ONLY IF SPEAK PHONE NUMBER DIGITS SOME TIMES VOICE RECOGNITION DOESNT LAUNCH
I WISH THE VEHICLE HAD A CD PLAYER AS MOST OF MY MUSIC IS ON CD MY HUSBAND DOES NOT HAVE A SMART PHONE OR AN MP3 PLAYER YET SO HE DOES NOT HAVE ANY EXTERNAL MUSIC SOURCE IT S NOT A MAJOR INCONVENIENCE WE ARE JUST HAVING TO ADAPT
GET A BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION END UP YELLING AT SIRI EVERY TIME I WANT TO MAKE A CALL ALSO TAKES TOO LONG TO USE BETTER AND FASTER TO PUSH PHONE AND USE TOUCH SCREEN
THE VOICE RECOGNITION ESPECIALLY FOR NUMBERS
SIRIUS SUCKS CAN T EVEN GET A RELIABLE SIGNAL IN NYC
NAVIGATION SYSTEMS ROADS SHOULD BE UPGRADED WEEKLY AS THINGS CHANGE TO ASSIST YOUR OWNERS ENTERTAINMENT MY COMPLAINT IS THE RADIO SYSTEM IN MY PURCHASED EX MODEL SPORTAGE DOES NOT SOUND LIKE STEREO AND EVEN TO THE PASSENGERS IN THE BACK WORSE
BUILT IN NAVIGATION
REAL TIME TRAFFIC ISN T ALWAYS ACCURATE ALSO ACCESSING MUSIC LIBRARY FROM CELL PHONE IPOD CAN BE CHALLENGING SYSTEM DOES NOT DISPLAY THE LIBRARY IF YOU DO NOT USE THE INCONTROL APP FROM LAND ROVER
GET MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO WORK
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SOMETIMES INACCURATE THE MAPS FROM KIA S SUPPLIER ARE NOT THE GREATEST NOR THE MOST ACCURATE I HAVE SEEN BETTER AND I HAVE SEEN WORSE OVERALL THIS ONE IS PRETTY GOOD THOUGH COULD BE BETTER
WISH THERE WERE A CD PLAYER
NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH VOICE ACTIVATED COMMANDS
COULD HAVE A CD PLAYER AS WELL AS THE SATELLITE RADIO
BLUETOOTH RINGER FOR INCOMING CALLS IS DEAFENING IT IS AFFECTED BY ANY CHANGES MADE WITH THE VOLUME DURING A CALL BUT CALL VOLUME AND RING VOLUME ARE NOT COMPARABLE
TOUCH PAD IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT THAT USER FRIENDLY EASIER TO USE CELL PHONE THE WHOLE KEYPAD IS VERY SENSITIVE ONE SLIGHT MOVE CHANGES SEARCH THUS TOO DISTRACTING
HATE THE TOUCH PAD WAS MUCH EASIER WHEN IT WAS A KNOB INSTEAD LIKE ON THE 450H
I BELIEVE BOSE IS ONE OF THE BEST AUTO AUDIO MAKERS MOST OTHERS DO NOT PROVIDE CRISP CLEAR SOUND
I EXPECTED MORE FROM LEXUS I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONFIGURE THE SCREEN MORE TO WIDEN CERTAIN COLUMNS AND SHORTEN OTHERS AS STATED EARLIER IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE SATELLITE PRESETS ONLY LIST THE SATELLITE CHANNEL NUMBER AND NOT THE NAME
VOICE RECOGNITION MUST OFTEN REPEAT COMMANDS
THE TOUCH PAD FOR OPERATING THE SYSTEM IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE I CONSIDER THIS THE WORSE THING ABOUT THE CAR
NAVIGATION DIFFICULT TO USE AS EXPLAINED EARLIER SHOULD HAVE QUICK ACCESS BUTTON TO CHANGE STATE LOCATION
IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE STEERING WHEEL AUDIO CONTROLS SOMETIMES THEY SEEM TO WORK SOMETIMES NOT IN ANY CASE THEY ARE COMPLICATED AND NOT INTUITIVE THE NAV SYSTEM DOESN T ALWAYS TAKE ME TO MY CORRECT DESTINATION
THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT SEEMS STRONG ENOUGH I USE SPOTIFY AND THE SONGS SKIP SOMETIMES WHEN TRYING TO CALL SOMEONE I ALWAYS USE VOICE RECOGNITION BUT IT NEVER WORKS FIRST TIME BUT I DO LIKE HOW IT DOES CONFIRM DIALING THE RIGHT PERSON I HAD
GET RID OF THE NAV SYSTEM AND INTEGRATE THE IPHONE SYSTEM INSTEAD
GET RID OF THE TOUCH PAD INTERFACE IT S TOO COMPLICATED TAKES ATTENTION AWAY FROM DRIVING AND IS MOST DISTRACTING I LOVE THIS CAR BUT I MUST SAY THAT IF I D REALIZED HOW MUCH I D HATE THIS SYSTEM I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ANOTHER MAKE OF CAR
NEED TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE IF USER STILL HAS TO LOOK AT SCREEN WHEN SELECTING CHOICES
TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE MUCH BETTER THAN MOUSE CONTROLS
NAV IS STILL TOO DIFFICULT TO USE MY OPINION AND VOICE RECOGNITION IS RUDIMENTARY AND DISAPPOINTING EVEN BASIC COMMANDS ARE OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE TO GIVE LEXUS OWNERS SIRI LIKE INTERFACE   PERFORMANCE WHY ISN
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T RECOGNIZE ANY COMMANDS
THE TOUCH CONTROLLER IS THE ISSUE INABILITY OF SYSTEM TO ADJUST TO ADDRESSES IT DOES NOT HAVE IN MEMORY JUST NOT ENOUGH SOFTWARE BEHIND THE SYSTEM IT IS THE AMOUNT AND DETAIL OF THE SOFTWARE THAT IS THE PROBLEMS NOT THE MISTAKES IN THE SOFTWARE
ALLOW VOICE COMMAND TO DESTINATIONS OTHERS THAN HOME
THE NAV SYSTEM USES OUTDATED MAPS IT COSTS AROUND $300 TO UPDATE UPDATES ARE ONLY YEARLY UP DATES ARE ALREADY OUT OF DATE WHEN YOU GET IT
FREQUENT DROPPING OF BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO MOBILE DEVICE WHEN ENTERING EXITING VEHICLE
VOICE COMMANDS ARE MORE LIKE VOICE SUGGESTIONS MUCH IMPROVEMENT NEEDED DON T SEEM TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH OTHER DEVICES RECOGNIZING WHAT I AM SAYING VERY FRUSTRATING TO USE END UP IMPUTING INFO USING TOUCHPAD

GIVING DIRECTION ON NAVIGATION
NEED TO PROVIDE FULL COMPATIBILITY FOR WINDOWS PHONE
NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO USE
THE OLD FASHIONED CLOCK LOCATED IN THE DASHBOARD SHOULD BE DIGITALIZED TO CONFORM WITH HIGH TECH FEATURES ON THE REST OF THE DASHBOARD
VOICE RECOGNITION DIFFICULT AT TIMES
I FIND IT DISTRACTING WHILE I AM DRIVING WISH THE SCREEN COULD BE ELIMINATED BECAUSE OF SAFETY CONCERNS
IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IT IS NOT GOOD IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE SOUND THAT COMES OUT OF THE RADIO I LOVE IT
NAVIGATION MADE SIMPLE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE EASIER TO USE
I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THE AUDIO SYSTEM UNDERSTAND WHAT I M SAYING MY VOICE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SETUP OF DIFFERENT VIEWS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN HANDHELDS CONSEQUENTLY I AM EITHER STILL FIGURING IT OUT OR NOT GOING TO GET IT THE WAY I AM USED TO USING A GARMAM

MY WIFE HAS HAD ISSUES WITH THE HANDS FREE OPERATION OF HERE CELL PHONE CALLING PARTY CAN NOT HERE HER
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS JUST VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE NO EASE OF ZOOM IN OR ZOOM OUT USERS MANUAL IS DAUNTING

1 NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS MORE DIFFICULT TO READ STREETS COMPARED TO OUR OTHER CAR LEXUS 2 TRAFFIC ALERTS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO READ COMPARED TO OTHER CAR LEXUS
TOUCH SCREEN IS TOO SENSITIVE
SPOTIFY INTEGRATION AND GOOGLE NOW ACCESS SIMILAR TO SIRI EYES FREE
THE SYSTEM IS PROBABLY FINE BUT I NEED MORE TUTELAGE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE AUDIO CONTROL FUNCTION I STILL PREFER MANUAL KNOB TYPE CONTROLS OVER VOICE CONTROL OR EVEN TOUCH SCREEN BECAUSE I AM USED TO IT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOICE CONTROLS NEEDS TO BE SIMPLIFIED
HARD TO GET VOICE RECOGNITION TO WORK AND TO TURN OFF
THE VOICE COMMANDS ARE DIFFICULT THE TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE SEEMS OVERLY COMPLICATED
FORD S MY TOUCH SYSTEM IS STILL TO SLOW TO RESPOND NEEDS A PROCESSOR UPGRADE
THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE THE TOUCHPAD IS TERRIBLE TOO MANY STEPS TO FINDING FREQUENTLY USED FEATURES THE SOUND IS LOUSY FOR THE PRICE A $70K CAR SHOULD PREFORM MUCH BETTER THAN THIS DOES MY OUTDATED AUDI WAS EASIER TO USE AND PE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ASKS FOR THE WHOLE ADDRESS AT ONCE THEN MANY TIMES IT WON T GET IT RIGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER IT IT ASKED FOR EACH ITEM SEPATATELY STATE CITY STREET NUMBER ETC
INTEGRATION WITH GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE
VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD BE PROGRAMMED TO THE OWNER OR PRIMARY USERS VOICE REGARDLESS OF ACCENTS THIS FEATURE SHOULD BE PROGRAMMABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE FUTURE OWNER OF THE VEHICLE
OVERALL I THINK HE SYSTEM IS AN OUTSTANDING SYSTEM BUT I DON T LIKE THAT THE SYSTEM IS ESSENTIALLY FEATURE LOCKED IT LL BE THE SAME SYSTEM FOUR YEARS FROM NOW WITH LITTLE TO NO CHANGES AND THAT S NOT WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT ANYMORE CARPLAY AND ANDRO
THE TOGGLE BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL ONLY GOES THROUGH 6 PRESET CHANNELS WOULD LIKE IT TO GO THROUGH ALL 18

VOICE RECOGNITION NOT GREAT HAVE TO REPEAT COMMANDS

I HAVE BETTER RESULTS WITH MY $199 SONY RADIO IN MY 1990 RANGER THAN WITH SYNC
I WOULD LOVE IT IF IT COULD READ ME MY TEXT MESSAGES BUT I MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SINHCE I HAVE AN IPHONE IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE BLUETOOTH
SPEAKER SOUND IT APPEARS TO TRY TO BRING IN TOO MUCH BASS AT THE RISKS OF SACRIFICING THE OVERALL QUALITY AND CLARITY OF THE SPEAKERS I EXPECTED MORE FROM THX
THE USB PORT IS A LITTLE HARD TO GET TO IN THAT DRAWER ONCE YOU GET IT IN THERE IT IS FINE BUT IT SEEMS THAT YOU WOULD PUT THAT USB PORT IN A LITTLE BIT EASIER PLACE TO ACCESS
VOICE RECOGNITION REQUIRES SPECIFIC COMMMANDS NOT CONVERSATIONAL ENGLISH
TOO MANY STEPS TO GET TO NAVIGATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST TYPE IT IN OR SAY DESTINATION AND GIVE AN ADDRESS
IPHONE 5S DOESN T WORK BY USB
I WAS SHOCKED AT THE POOR SOUND QUALITY OF THE RADIO SINCE IT IS A BOSE AND I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH BOSE THERE IS TOO MUCH BASE AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ADJUST THE SETTINGS TO CORRECT THAT
THE HEAD UNIT NEEDS MASSIVE IMPROVEMENTS IT LOOKS OUT DATED AND CAN BE A LITTLE SLOW HAS A LOT OF BUGS AND KEEPS WANTING TO SWITCH OUT OF NO WHERE TO PRESET 1 IN THE LIST WITH THE COMMANDER KNOB NO DEFAULT SATELLITE RADIO BIG NEGATIVE AND NO
ALL OF THE SYSTEMS EXCEPT THE RADIO AND CD PLAYER MUST BE PURCHASED AND INSTALLED
THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE HANDS FREE PHONE
INFORMATION SCREEN COULD HAVE BEEN UPDATED BEFORE
OTHER THAN NAVIGATION SYSTEM EVERYTHING IS OUTSTANDING
SOUND QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERPHONE SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED

BASE MODEL SHOULD HAVE BLUETOOTH PHONE
LIMITED CAPACITY OF DISC SPACE FOR PHONE BOOK ETC LONG DELAY IN PLAYING MUSIC THROUGH BLUETOOTH AFTER STARTING VEHICLE
OPTION TO CHANGE BAND WITH OR TO SWITCH TO BLUETOOTH ON STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS

USING SERVICES FOR NAVIGATION ARE INEFFECTIVE WHEN TRAVELING OVER 25MPH THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM DOES NOT HEAR VOICE EVEN WHEN SCREAMING AT THE MICROPHONE AND JUST CONTINUES IN A LOOP AND THEN AFTER 10 MINUTES OF TIME INVESTMENT ULTIMATELY
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS QUITE GOOD BUT IT ISN T GREAT MAYBE I EXPECT TOO MUCH
IMPROVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM

THE PROBLEM IS THAT I USE ANDROID GOOGLE PLAY APPS FOR NAVIGATION I WISH YOU COULD GET A CAR THAT USED ANDROID AND GOOGLE PLAY APPS THEN I COULD HAVE EVERYTHING I WANT AS IT IS INAVIGATE MOSTLY WITH MY PHONE THE APP I WANT TO USE IS WAZE
PREFER GARMIN FOR NAVIGATION VOICE COMMAND IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND OFTEN IT MISINTERPRETS WHAT I AM SAYING STOPPED USING IT MY MOTHER HAS SOME HEARING DIFFICULTIES SO I ALWAYS SWITCH FROM HANDS FREE TO TALK TO HER BECAUSE SHE CAN T UNDERSTAND
INITIATING BLUETOOTH SERVICE COULD BE COMPLETELY HANDS FREE
I THINK IT WILL ALWAYS BE HARD TO HEAR PHONE CALLS ON SPEAKERS ESPECIALLY IF I M ON SPEAKER AND THE PERSON I M TALKING TO IS ON SPEAKER AND WE ARE BOTH DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD
I USE WAZE ON MY SMARTPHONE FOR NAVIGATION BECAUSE IT IS MORE ACCURATE UP TO THE MINUTE TRAFFIC POLICE AND STOP LIGHT CAMERAS SINCE IT IS CROWD SOURCED
COULD OPERATE BETTER WITH IPHONES
IT HAS A VERY NEE LOOKING AUDIO SYSTEM WE LIKE THE SCREEN PLACEMENT
I TRIED TO USED THE VOICE ACTIVATED PHONE CALLS BUT IT WAS HARD TO USE AND DIDN T UNDERSTAND MY VOICE SO NOW I JUST USE THE DIGITAL DISPLAY AND MAKE CALLS ONLY BEFORE DRIVING OR WHEN STOPPED
RADIO STATION SELECTION BUT THIS ISSUE MAY BE USER PROBLEM WILL CHECK MANUAL TO DETERMINE IF I AM MISSING OR MISUSING A FEATURE
VOICE RECOGNITION AND COMMANDS ARE CONFUSING AND THE SYSTEM DOES NOT PROCESS WELL
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM REALLY DRAGS DOWN THE SCORE IN THIS CATEGORY WE HAVE FOUND IT TO BE A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT WE NOW RELY ON OUR PHONE S GPS TO ASSIST US WHEN NEEDED
BETTER EASE OF CONNECTIVITY FOR USB PLUGGED DEVICES AND BETTER FUNCTIONALITY WHEN USING PANDORA VIA BLUETOOTH OR THROUGH USB PLUGGED DEVICES
THE FACT THAT THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK WELL IS UNACCEPTABLE
IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SET UP AN ANDROID PHONE TO THE BLUETOOTH
COULD NOT RECEIVE TEXT MESSAGES ON CAR S DISPLAY EVEN THOUGH IT ASKED TO DOWNLOAD THEM
THE DOWNLOAD TIME FOR TEXT MESSAGES IS LENGTHY AND SHOULD BE IMPROVED
THE VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY COULD BE IMPROVED IT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE BASIC COMMANDS
NO STEERING CONTROLS
FOR THE SYSTEM TO PICK UP THE LAST SONG PLAYED ON AN IPOD I DON T EVEN BOTHER TO PLAY MY IPOD IN THE CX 5 BECAUSE IT S SUCH A LOUSY EXPERIENCE NO EXCUSE FOR MAZDA ON THIS ISSUE
ENTERING ADDRESS IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND HAVING THE SYSTEMS UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING LOTS OF REPEATING WHICH IS FRUSTRATING
SPEAKERS ARE POOR SOUND NOT THE BEST STEREO HANDS FREE SYSTEM NOT RESPONSIVE WITH CONSISTENT COMMANDS NOISE TOO LOUD WHEN DRIVING PAST CERTAIN MPH
WHEN MY IPOD IS CONNECTED AND I TURN OFF THE VEHICLE IT DOES NOT CONTINUE WHERE I LEFT OFF WHEN I GET BACK IN THE CAR VERY ANNOYING
MAKE SURE THAT THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WORKS FULLY WITH IPHONES
TEXT MESSAGE FUNCTIONALITY DOES NOT WORK WITH IPHONE 6 BIG LETDOWN

THE RADIO STATION SETTINGS ARE SET SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT SOMETIMES WE PRESS THE WRONG ONE & HAVE TO PRESS IT AGAIN TO GET THE CORRECT ONE HARD TO REACH ESP WHILE DRIVING
I HAVE AN I PHONE APPLE AND SYNC MICRO SOFT REALLY DON T WORK THAT WELL TOGETHER SYNC CAN READ AND COMPOSE TEXTS BUT NOT IF YOU USE AN APPLE PHONE THAT BEING SAID OVERALL IT S A GOOD SYSTEM
I DON T REALLY USE THE TECHNOLOGY PARTS AS MUCH AS OTHERS MIGHT
THE MULTIPLE CONTROLS MAY BE OVERKILL I M NOT SURE YOU NEED CONSOLE CONTROLS IN DASH CONTROLS TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS AND STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS

GET AN IPOD 5 TO CONNECT MAKE THE PORTS EASIER TO GET TO
MAKE IT EASIER TO CHANGE STATIONS ON THE RADIO TOO MANY STEPS REQUIRED
I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO MAKE A CALL FROM MY CAR PHONE I HAVE RECEIVED A FEW BUT NEVER PLACED ONE I WISH I HAD A CD PLAYER AS I DO NOT OWN ANY OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT DEVISES I DO NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN MY CAR
IT S CONFUSING THAT SOME TOUCH SCREEN COMMANDS ARE BLOCKED WHILE MOVING AND OTHERS ARE NOT
OVERALL QUALITY OF RADIO AND CD SOUND
IT WORKS BLUETOOTH GOES IN AND OUT
SYSTEM CONSISTENTLY FORGETS RADIO STATIONS AND RE SETS USB FLASH DRIVE TO SONG NUMBER 1
AUDIO SYSTEM COULD USE A PILLAR MOUNTED TWEETERS TO PROVIDE A BETTER HIGH FREQUENCY RANGE THAN IT HAS WITH THE DASH MOUNTED SPEAKERS 1ST GENERATION MAZDA3 W  BOSE HAD BETTER HIGHS BUT THIS 3RD GENERATION CAR WITH BOSE SOUND HAS AN OVERALL BETTER
LOADING UP THE DATA ON MY IPOD THROUGH THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS SLOW IT TAKES 2 OR 3 MINUTES TO FINALLY GET ALL OF THE SONGS ARTISTS SYNCED UP SO I CAN PLAY A SPECIFIC PLAYLIST OR SONG IT ALSO WIPES EVERYTHING CLEAN AND MUST START ALL OVER EVERY T
THE VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE OFTEN MISTAKES WHAT I AM SAYING
TO BE ABLE TO REVERSE WITHIN AN CD TRACK AND NOT JUST BETWEEN TRACKS
VOICE OPERATION OF NAV SYSTEM WOULD IMPROVE EXPERIENCE WHILE DRIVING WITHOUT HAVING TO TO USE DASH MOUNTED CONTROLS
NAVIGATION IS COMPLEX TO PROGRAM AND NOT INUTITIVE TO SHUT OFF
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SCREEN SHOULD ALSO DISPLAY RADIO STATION UNABLE TO USE WIFI AFTER MULTIPLE CONTACTS DEALER IS NOT ABLE TO SOLVE WIFI PROBLEM USER MANUAL GUIDANCE IS POOR
I WOULD LOVE A 6 CD CHANGER BUT WAS TOLD IT IS NOT AVAILABLE I DON T USE MP3 S OR MY PHONE FOR MUSIC I DON T LIKE HOW IT SOUNDS
VOICE COMMANDS VS SYSTEM UNDERSTANDING VOICE COMMANDS
THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD HAVE BEEN DESIGN TO BETTER USAGE OF SPACE CD PLAYER IS PLACED AT AN HARD TO REACH POSITION
THE SOUND QUALITY ISN T THE BEST BUT IT IS JUST A BASE MODEL
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE TO USE THERE ARE TOO MANY STEPS COMPARED TO THE GARMIN THAT I USED TO USE
I USUALLY LISTEN TO MUSIC STORED ON A USB DRIVE THE SYSTEM OFTEN FORGETS WHAT SONG I WAS LISTENING TO WHEN RESTARTING THE CAR AND STARTS OVER AT THE FIRST SONG THIS IS MORE ANNOYING THAN YOU WOULD THINK

THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT AS ROBUST AS I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED IT TO BE I TRIED ADJUSTING THE BALANCES BUT IT STILL SOUNDED A LITTLE TINNY
I REALLY DISLIKE THE FACT THAT I HAVE TO TURN ON THE NAV EVERY TIME I START THE CAR
THINK NAVIGATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED
AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED AT LEAST THREE UPCOMING MANEUVERS NEED TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN
I DON T HAVE NAVIGATION AND THEREFORE I AM NOT TOTALLY HANDS FREE I CANNOT USE VOICE COMMAND TO DIAL A PHONE NUMBER WITHOUT GOING THROUGH SIRI ON MY IPHONE THAT INVOLVES PRESSING A BUTTON AND I AM NOT TOTALLY HANDS FREE MY IPHONE CANNOT ALWA
THE PASSENGER CANNOT OPERATE THE NAV SYSTEM WHEN THE CAR IS MOVING THIS IS AN UNNECESSARY RESTRICTION YOU KNOW WHEN THE PASSENGER AIRBAG IS ACTIVE ALLOW NAV SYSTEM USE
INTEGRATION WITH MODERN DEVICES CAN BARELY SUPPORT AN IPHONE AND ANDROID BUT FULLY SUPPORT BLACK BERRY HOW MANY USERS OF EACH ARE OUT THERE
GET THE INTERNET RADIO WORKING
THE GARMIN SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE ANALYZED AND RESEARCHED THIS WAS A DOWNGRADE FROM THE MERCEDES BENZ GPS SYSTEM VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT MERCEDES DIDN T THROUGHLY DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE BEFORE CONTRACTING WITH GARMIN GARMIN HAS POOR CUSTOMER SERV
SHOULD HAVE BLUETOOTH STANDARD
UNCOMFORTABLE CHANGING RADIO STATIONS WHILE DRIVING
WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT WAS CUMBERSOME TO ENTER INFORMATION AND WHEN KEYING IN POINTS OF INTERESTS THAT ARE VERY ESTABLISHED IT WOULD NOT GENERATE ANY USEFUL RESULTS
THE SOUND SYSTEM IS WEAK IN MY BUSINESS I LISTEN TO MUSIC FOR A LIVING THE MID RANGE AND BOTTOM  SUB ARE LACKING AGAIN IT SEEMS THE HARMON KARDON SYSTEM HAD A BETTER POWER SOURCE THAT FED THE MIDS AND SUB SOMETHING WAS CHANGED FOR THE 201
UPDATE THE SCREEN IMAGES TO BE BRIGHTER BIGGER AND EITHER MAKE IT TOUCH SCREEN OR CHANGE THE DIAL ON THE CONSOLE TO A MOUSE THE LEXUS RX THAT I DROVE PREVIOUSLY DID THIS BEAUTIFULLY AND I WAS ABLE TO MANIPULATE THE SCREEN WITH QUICK RESPONSE TIME
FLEXIBLE TO USE AND GOOD SOUND QUALITY
QUALITY OF BLUETOOTH CALL ON THE RECEIVING END FROM THE VEHICLE ROAD NOISE IS EXCESSIVE WITH THIS FEATURE
NAV SYSTEM IS HARD TO MANIPULATE MY WIFE AND I HATE USING IT BMW IS MORE INTUITIVE WE NEVER USE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM BECAUSE IT DOESN T WORK WELL WE NEVER USE THE IN CONSOLE APPS WASTE OF SPACE
POOR CAPACITY IN HARD DRIVE
ACCURACY OF NAVI
VOICE RECOGNITION ONLY WORKS WITH THE NAVIGATION THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE NOT LINKED TO THE PHONE
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE SCREEN WAS A TOUCH SCREEN INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SCROLL AROUND TO TYPE A DESTINATION
TUNING SATELLITE AND BROADCAST RADIO IS HARD
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAD A BOSE SYSTEM
I DON T USE HANDS FREE OR AUDIO BUT THE SURVEY WOULDN T LET ME MOVE ON WITHOUT AN OVERALL GRADE WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO ASSESS IF I VE NEVER USED THEM SO MY ANSWERS WERE JUST A GUEST ON THOSE 2
NAVIGATION STILL WOULD LIKE TO SEE A N S E W RED LIGHT ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROW ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SYSTEM MIGHT BE ON THE RADIO MODE WHEN ONE WANTS TO KNOW IN WHICH DIRECTION ONE IS TRAVELING
WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTED PHONE THE SOUND QUALITY SEEMS BELOW AVERAGE
DOES NOT UNDERSTAND VOICE COMMANDS VERY WELL
PROVIDE UP TO DATE MAPS $75 GARMIN GPS HAS BETTER MAPS TO THE AREAS THAT I TRAVEL
CANNOT UNDERSTAND VOICE COMMANDS KEEPS SAYING PARDON POLITE BUT INEFFECTIVE

VERY FRUSTRATING THAT WE FEEL IT CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND OUR VOICE COMMANDS INFORMATION ESPECIALLY WHEN WE NEED THE INFORMATION ASAP WE ALWAYS END UP USING OUR IPHONE INSTEAD
VOICE RECOGNITION & NAVIGATION NEED TO BE MORE ACCURATE
TOUCH PAD IS HARD TO USE MOVING THROUGH RADIO CHANNELS IS PAINFUL
STORE THE DISPLAY SCREEN WHEN PARKED
THE NAVIGATION COMMUNICATION SCREEN LOOKS LIKE IT WAS AN AFTER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE BUILT IN TO THE DASH BETTER OR TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CLOSE IT WHEN NOT IN USE
NAV SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED   SIMPLIFIED WOULD PREFER SIRI LIKE VERBAL COMMAND SYSTEM WHERE YOU COULD JUST SAY AN ADDRESS AND THE CAR WOULD UNDERSTAND AND TAKE YOU THERE ALSO ONE TIME FOR WHATEVER REASON ROUTE GUIDANCE WOULD NOT ENGAGE
THIS IS THE FIRST NAVIGATION SYSTEM WE OWN AND STILL GETTING TO KNOW THIS NEW CAR
POOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND QUALITY
VOICE RECOGNITION OF ADDRESSES AND POI IN NAVIGATION
TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE MUCH MORE USEFUL
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS WHEN USING TO PLACE CALLS FROM CONTACTS IN PHONE BOOK
OTHER THAN THE NAVIGATION SCREEN ALL OTHER SCREENS ONLY DISPLAY AS FULL SCREEN BRIEFLY THEN DEFAULT BACK TO SPLIT SCREEN MODE BE NICE TO HAVE THE RADIO OR MEDIA SCREEN REMAIN ON FULL TO CHANGE RADIO STATIONS WITHOUT USING THE STEERING WHEEL
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER OR EASIER
TOUCH INSTEAD OF FANCY MOUSE VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE
BETTER INSTRUCTIONS ON CLIENTS REGARDING USE OF THE ABOVE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR NAVIGATION AND PHONE SYSTEMS
TOUCHSCREEN MOUSE IS DIFFICULT TO CALIBRATE DISTRACTS FROM DRIVING
DON T REALLY LIKE THE TOUCH PAD A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE BETTER
BETTER SPEECH RECOGNITION
VERY POOR VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION SIRI SAVES THE DAY FOR THE PHONE FEATURES AND I HATE THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM LOCKUPS DESCRIBED EARLIER
WIRELESS CHARGER IS AN OPTION DOES NOT CHARGE IPHONE
WHY DOES MY IPHONE NOT GIVE ME AUDITORY SIGNALS WHEN BLUETOOTH CONNECTED TO THE VEHICLE MY HUSBAND S SAMSUNG GIVES AUDITORY SIGNALS WHEN IT RECEIVES ITEMS E G TEXT MESSAGES
SHOW A MORE DYNAMIC WEATHER MAP
ADJUSTING NAVIGATION USING TOUCH PAD WOULD BE FABULOUS IF IT WAS TOUCH SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED SYSTEM DOESN T RECOGNIZE MY VOICE WELL IT ALSO BE USER ERROR AND NOT THE SYSTEM
BETTER MORE INTUITIVE VOICE COMMAND RECOGNITION SYSTEM REMOVE RESTRICTIONS THAT DO NOT ALLOW THE NAVIGATION TO BE PROGRAMMED WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION THE PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPERATE THE NAVIGATION WHILE THE VEHICLE IS BEING DRIVEN
VOICE RECOGNITION IS ALL BUT UNUSABLE FOR NAVIGATION THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM REQUIRES YOU TO GO THROUGH A RIDICULOUS MENU AND IS FAR TOO COMPLICATED TO USE MY ACURA RL WAS A SO EASY TO USE IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THEY HAD TO MESS IT
I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT A VOICE RECOGNITION TO ANYTHING VOICE RECOGNITION HAS NEVER WORKED IN ANY AREA
PROGRAMMING ADDRESSES ETC SEEMS MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN ON OUR TSX
VOICE RECOGNITION IS THE ONLY MAJOR COMPLAINT IT SUCKS
TOUCH SCREEN REQUIRES TOO MUCH TAKING YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING
VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS OVERLY COMPLICATED COMPARED TO OUR OTHER RECENT CARS BUTTON LAYOUT IS NOT ALL THAT INTUITIVE THERE ARE SOME REDUNDANT BUTTONS ON THE CENTER DASH MAKING THE SYSTEM FEEL A LITTLE CLUTTERED SOUND QUALITY IS OUTSTANDING
VOICE RECOGNITION BUT I HAVE NOT USED IT MUCH MAY JET TAKE PRACTICE
I GET COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF SOUND FROM PEOPLE I AM TALKING TO THROUGH BLUETOOTH NEVER GOT THESE COMPLAINTS WITH PREVIOUS VEHICLE
WHEN PLAYING MUSIC OVER BLUETOOTH W  IPHONE 5S IF I PLUG IN USB CABLE THE MUSIC STOPS THEN I HAVE TO CHANGE THE AUDIO SOURCE FROM BT TO AM FM WHATEVER THEN BACK TO BT FOR THE MUSIC TO RESUME
NEED TO IMPROVE WORKFLOW AND EASE OF USE TOUCH SCREEN WOULD HELP FOR AUDIO CONTROLS OVER DIAL AND BLUETOOTH STEPS ARE TERRIBLE
METHOD OF ENTERING DESTINATION ADDRESS TO NAV SYSTEM ALSO NO CD CHANGER AVAILABLE

EASE OF USE HAVING DUAL SCREENS IS REALLY A JOKE IM VERY TECH SAVVY AND THIS DEFINITELY WASNT DESIGNED BY AN AMERICAN
THE VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS WORK FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE HIGHER PITCH VOICES MINE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING
ACURA NEEDS TO GET ON THE BALL WITH APPLE SO THE DEVICE CAN SEAMLESSLY HOOK UP TO THE IPOD IPHONE THIS IS A DEAL BREAKER FOR MY NEXT VEHICLE
THE DUAL SCREEN DOES NOT REALLY SEEM TO ADD MUCH VALUE WHEN YOU DO NOT HAVE NAVIGATION
HD RADIO AUDIO QUALITY IS POOR VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION DOESN T WORK USING BLUETOOTH AUDIO IS SLOW WHEN FAST FORWARDING THROUGH SONG PLAYLIST
I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THE SYSTEM MUCH HIGHER MARKS IF IT HADN T BEEN FOR THE POOR VISUAL DISPLAY OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
SENSITIVITY OF VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM SOMETIMES DOESN T UNDERSTAND MY COMMANDS
COMMANDING CAN BE UNNECESSARILY TEDIOUS FOR EXAMPLE IF AN ARTIST HAS JUST ONE ALBUM HARD DISK IPHONE IT SHOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY SELECTED INSTEAD OF MAKING YOU SELECT IT ALSO THE TACTILE FEEL OF THE CENTER COMMAND KNOB IS CLUMSY
BETTER PLACEMENT OF MICROPHONE FOR HANDSFREE PHONE OPERATION IT SOUNDS TOO MUCH LIKE CALLING FROM A CAVE MIC NEEDS TO BE PLACED CLOSER TO DRIVER WITH BETTER DIRECTIVITY AND ECHO CANCELLATION I HAVE USED SYSTEMS IN OLDER AND LOWER COST CARS T

VOICE RECOGNITION APPLE SIRI INTEGRATION
I CANNOT STREAM AUDIO VIA BLUETOOTH OR CHANGE PROGRAMED RADIO STARTIONS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL
INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING USE OF VOICE RECOGNITION ARE UNCLEAR RESULTING IN NON USE AT LEAST UNTIL I HAVE MORE TIME TO STUDY THEM
TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE EASIER TO USE THAN THE DIAL
PUT THE PLUG IN FOR THE IPOD IN THE MIDDLE CONSOLE NOT IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OR MAKE IT SO ONCE IT S PLUGGED IN THROUGH THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT IT CAN BE COMPLETELY CONTROLLED VIA THE DASHBOARD CONTROLS
I GIVE IT A 5 BECASUE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE
DIAL TO SPELL OUT LOCATION FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CUMBERSOME
QUICK TUTORIAL OF VOICE COMMANDS I STILL DON T THINK I M SAYING THE RIGHT THINGS TO GET THEM TO ACTIVATE PROPERLY THE AUDI DEALER QUICKLY WENT THROUGH IT BUT I NEED A CHEAT SHEET

SOUND QUALITY FROM SPEAKERS
CAR CAME WITH OUT OF DATE APPLE CONNECTION CORD FOR ATTACHMENT WITHIN THE GLOVEBOX

I CAN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAN THE MAP ON THE NAV MAYBE IT CAN BUT I CAN T FIGURE IT OUT MY PAST NAV S I CAN MOVE THE MAP AROUND TO SEE WHAT ELSE IS AROUND BUT ALL I CAN DO ON THIS ONE IS ZOOM IN OR OUT
I TEST DROVE A TESLA AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR LARGE TOUCH SCREEN
IPOD DOES NOT DISPLAY ARTWORK AND THERE SHOULD BE BETTER WAY TO ACCESS LARGE BUBER OF SONGS ARTISTS PLAYLIST VIA A ALPHABETIC TAB INSTEAD OF HAVING TO TURN THE SCROLL KNOB FOREVER WHEN GOING FROM A A IN A LARGE COLLECTION OF MUSIC
I PREFER BLUETOOTH TO USING CABLES ESPECIALLY CABLES IN THE GLOVE BOX IT JUST SEEMS OUTDATED
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY FRUSTRATING
MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS AROUND THE VOICE RECOGNITION I CAN T SEEM TO GET THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO UNDERSTAND MY VOICE OR THE VOICE OF ANYONE SITTING IN MY CAR IT S COMPLETELY USELESS TO ME
WISH SELECTING THE BLUETOOTH SOURCE OF AUDIO WOULD BE AVAILABLE

THE INTEGRATION OF DEVICES LIKE IPODS IS POOR AUDI HAS A PROPRIETARY CONNECTOR SYSTEM SEARCHING FOR MUSIC ON A LARGE IPOD IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WHILE DRIVING
DELAYS IN VOICE RECOGNITION SOMETIMES BUTTON NEEDS TO BE PUSHED MULTIPLE TIMES TO GET RESPONSE
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT WORK WELL FOR ME

I HAVENT GOT THE VOICE RECOGNITION TO RECOGNIZE WHAT I WAS SAYING WHEN READING WHAT IT WANTS ME TO SAY
ABILITY TO SCROLL THROUGH IPHONE MUSIC LIBRARY OTHER THAN SIMPLY TO SCROLL TO NEXT SONG IS WEAK NO REASON FOR THE TECHNOLOGY NOT TO EXIST LEXUS HAS CAPABILITY
AUDI IS BEHIND IN PROVIDING A STATE OF THE ART AUDIO SYSTEM
AS NOTED EARLIER SHOULD RECOGNIZE PHONE NUMBERS STARTING WITH + FOLLOWED BY COUNTRY CODE

NAVIGATION SYSTEM EASIER TO USE
OUTDATED SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE TOUCHSCREEN AT A MINIMUM VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD BE BETTER SEE FORD ESCAPE SYSTEM WHICH IF FAR SUPERIOR

INTERACTIONS WITH THE IPHONE 6 ARE EXTREMELY POOR IPHONE 5S IS A LITTLE BETTER
THE CONTROLS ARE NOT INTUITIVE FOR SEARCHING SAVING ADDRESSES AND NAVIGATING THE DUAL DISPLAY IS OFTEN CONFUSING
WOULD LIKE THE PASSENGER TO OPERATE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING SO AS NOT TO CONCENTRATE ON THE SYSTEM AND BUT ON MY DRIVING
A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY LOOKING FOR A USE ITS EASIER TO USE TOUCHSCREEN OR KNOBS THAN PLAY WITH THE VOICE NONRECOGNTION SYSTEM
THE RADIO DISPLAY CAN BE VASTLY IMPROVED TO SHOW THE ARTIST AND SONG TITLE ON THE SAME SCREEN THE ICON FOR AM FM ON THE DISPLAY SCREEN IS WAY TOO BIG

IDRIVE SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY AND HAS A LEARNING CURVE TO IT
UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM IS MANDATORY HARMON KARDON IS GREAT IN A 3 SERIES BUT JUST AVERAGE IN A 6 SERIES I REGRET NOT UPGRADING TO PREMIUM SOUND PACKAGE

TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR FASTER PROGRAMMING

MAKE IT SIMPLER TO USE WITH TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS SIMILAR TO WHAT I HAVE ON MY JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE
I WISH THAT I COULD CHANGE FROM ONE PROGRAMED RADIO STATION TO THE NEXT VIA THE STEERING WHEEL SO FAR I HAVE BEEN PRESSING THE PRESETS MANUALLY ON THE RADIO AND NOT CHANGING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER USING THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROL
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT RECOGNIZE WORDS CORRECTLY OR EVEN CLOSE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY USER INTERFACE ARCHITECTURE NEEDS IMPROVEMENT BMW WOULD BE WISE TO ADOPT APPLE S ICAR SYSTEM WHICH IS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY AND INTUITIVE
VOICE CONTROL SUCKS CAN T USE IT AT ALL NAVIGATION SYSTEM ENTRIES CUMBERSOME IPOD USE NEAR IMPOSSIBLE OTHER THAN RANDOM
THE SOUND QUALITY COMING OUT OF THE SPEAKERS TO ME IT SOUNDS AS IF THE SPEAKERS ARE UNDER WATER AT TIMES
CONNECTIVITY WITH ANDROID PHONES IS TERRIBLE APP DEVELOPMENT BY BMW IS FOCUSED ON IPHONES WITH THE RESULT THAT ANDROID PHONES DON T HAVE NEARLY AS MUCH CONNECTIVITY THROUGH APPS E G IN VEHICLE CONTROLS CANNOT BE USED TO CONTROL AND PLAY SONGS
ABILITY TO MOVE POSITION ON NAVIGATION WITH A JOYSTICK WOULD BE NICE
WHEN YOU UPLOAD SONGS ONTO THE VEHICLE HARD DRIVE IT PLAYS THEM IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER NOT BY ALBUM ORDER THIS IS ANNOYING PLAYING SONGS FROM THE HARD DRIVE IS ALSO NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY THERE S NO SHUFFLE ALSO WISH THERE WAS A < > CONTROL O
FIRST AND FOREMOST BMW NEEDS TO INCLUDE TECH PACKAGES IN THE PRICE AND NOT MAKE IT AN ADD ON I HAD MORE TECH IN MY FORD FOCUS FOR LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE OF THIS BMW WHEN USING HANDS FREE THE AUDIO NEEDS TO BE LOUDER AND MORE CLEAR OVERALL
IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION THE SAVING GRACE IS THAT I CAN USE SIRI VIA THE VOICE RECOGNITION WITH MY BLUETOOTH CONNECTED IPHONE
FEATURES LIKE BLUETOOTH STREAMING SHOULD BE STANDARD OR INCLUDED WITH A OVERALL AUDIO UPGRADE NOT A $500 STAND ALONE FEATURE NEED BETTER APPS FOR REMOTE CONTROLLING OF THE CAR
TOO MANY BUTTONS TO PUSH TO SWITCH BETWEEN RADIO SATELLITE AND IPHONE MUSIC
ENJOY THE BLUETOOTH OPTION
I THOUGHT THE ENTIRE HEAD S UP DISPLAY WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO LEARN AND USE I COULDN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANUALLY DIAL A RADIO STATION TO CHANGE IT FROM THE ORIGINAL STATION I BELIEVE THE HEADS UP DISPLAY ESPECIALLY THE SOUND SYSTEM PART OF IT

THERE IS NOT ANY PROBLEM WITH TODAYS CONNECTIVITY IF THAT IS WHAT YOU WANT TO USE IN A CAR WHILE DRIVING THE BASE SOUND SYSTEM IN THE 2 SERIES DOS NOT SOUND GOOD AT ALL THE 1 SERIES WAS THE SAME THE 3 SERIES MUCH BETTER IT MOSTLY PLAYS TO THE
LIST FAVORITES MOVE CONTACTS TO ADDRESS BOOK COPY AND PASTE ADDRESS FROM WEB
MAKE CONTROLS INTUITIVE IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION ACCURACY
I NEVER USE THE IN VEHICLE NAVIGATION OR VOICE CONTROLS I ALWAYS USE MY IPHONE WITH SIRI TO CONTROL NAVIGATION AUDIO TEXT MESSAGES ETC

BETTER STANDARD SPEAKERS SUCH AS BOSE HARMAN KARDON OR BOWERS & WILKINS
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION OF COMMANDS
ADDING APPLE CARPLAY
THE NAVIGATION SCREEN NEEDS TO BE LARGER EXAMPLE TESLA SCREENS MORE TOUCH SCREEN AND LESS BUTTON
LESS AMOUNT OF STEPS TO MANUALLY ENTER A DESTINATION
AUDIO SYSTEM GETS OUT OF SYNC WITH IPOD AND IS UNABLE TO PLAY SONGS ONCE A MONTH IPOD HAS TO BE RESTARTED AND  OR RE SYNCED
THE FACT THAT YOU CANNOT ACCESS POI S WHILE DRIVING MAKES THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COMPLETELY USELESS I UNDERSTAND THE SAFETY ASPECT OF IT I AGREE ON NOT ALLOWING ENTERING IN ADDRESSES AND SUCH BUT TO NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE PRE POPULATED POI S T
EVERYTHING IS FINE EXCEPT THAT EVERY 5 10 PHONE CALL ATTEMPTS KILLS THE WHOLE RADIO PHONE NAV SYSTEM
IT WOULD BE FANTASTIC IF I COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE TOYS IN MY NEW CAR HOWEVER THE VOICE RECOGNITION JUST DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ME THE NAVIGATION IS USELESS I HAVE TO KNOW THE ADDRESS TO GET TO AN UNKNOWN PLACE IF I AM LOOKING FOR SAY A
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR SONGS ON THE IPOD IS ONLY FOR UP TO 32GB AS I HAVE AN IPOD CLASSIC WITH 256GB CAPACITY THAT IS OVER HALF FULL IT IS UNABLE TO ALLOW ME TO CHOOSE A SONG BY VOICE RECOGNITION IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A SONG SELECTION
OFTEN WHEN I AM USING THE TOUCH SCREEN I BUMP THE BUTTON FOR THE EMERGENCY FLASHERS THE FLASHER BUTTON MY HAVE BEEN BETTER LOCATED ABOVE THE SCREEN WHERE A WRIST WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO TURN IT ON
THE TRAFFIC PART OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK I PLAN TO TAKE IT TO THE DEALER FOR REPAIR

THE CONNECTION OF THE USB CORDS IT IS SMALL AND HARD TO GET FINGERS IN FOR ATTACHMENT
A BETTER SOUND QUALITY AND PRE PROGRAMMED EQUALIZER THAT IS AVAILABLE ON OTHER GM MODELS
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT RESPONSIVE TO TOUCH THE SOUND QUALITY IS TERRIBLE THE SATELLITE RADIO CLICKS OFF AT AN UNDERPASS A TRESTLE NEAR A ROCK ETC
IF POSSIBLE THE TOUCH SCREEN NEEDS TO BE A BIT MORE SENSITIVE TO TOUCH I HAVE DIFFICULTY SLIDING THROUGH THE PRESET STATIONS WHILE DRIVING
APPARENTLY MY VOICE VIA BLUETOOTH IS NOT THE BEST FROM WHAT I HEAR FROM FOLKS THAT I CALL I WILL DISCUSS ON MY NEXT SERVICE CALL OTHERWISE SYSTEM IS PRETTY GREAT OVERALL

NEED MY VOICE COMMANDS TO BE RECOGNIZED
NAVIGATION SHOULD HAVE A BACK ARROW WHEN RECEIVING A CALL TO VIEW MAP INSTEAD OF HAVING TO MANUALLY PRESS HOME BUTTON AND NAVI A BETTER WAY OF CHANGING THE ROUTE OPTIONS  BEING ABLE TO VIEW ROUTE OPTIONS VOICE DIRECTIONS SHOULD BE CUT OFF COMPL
SYSTEMS INTERFERE WITH USE OF CELL PHONE AND DISTRACT DRIVER NOT NEEDED
IT IS HARD TO CHANGE THE FEATURES OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SUCH AS VOLUME OF VOICE DIRECTIONS
THE NAVAGATION SYSTEM GIVES TOO MUCH DETAIL AND INSTRUCTION SOMETIMES YOU JUST SAY THE WRONG NAME AND SHE GIVES YOU A COMPLETE DISORTATION ON THE SYSTEM THIRTY OPTIONS JUST SAY REPEAT YOU DON T NEED THAT KIND OF INSTRUCTION EVERYTIME YOU MAKE A
ADD MORE APPS TO TOUCH SCREEN AND SPEED UP RESPONSE TO REQUEST TIME

NAVIGATION IS NOT EASY TO USE
SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTROL RADIO AND MAKE PHONE CALLS HANDS FREE NOT AVAILABLE ON BASE CAR EVEN WITH DRIVER CONVENIENCE PACKAGE
ENGINEERS SEEMED TO HAVE STOPPED SHORT FOR SOME BASIC FEATURES NEED TO ADD AN ASTERISK TO THE NUMBER PAD SO PROGRAMMED PHONE NUMBERS WITH PAUSES AND WAITS CAN WORK WHEN SWITCHING RADIO CHANNELS USING THE CENTER CONSOLE DIAL THE FUNCTION SWITCHES FROM THE FORW
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE EASY TO WORK OR JUST WORK I NEED TO TAKE IT IN JUST HAVEN T HAD TIME
I BELIEVE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE A LOT BETTER IT HAS BEEN INACCURATE AND IS NOT USER FRIENDLY ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING THE OLDER BMWS USED TO HAVE A SPLIT SCREEN WHERE YOU COULD HAVE THE MAP DISPLAYED AND THEN SPLIT TO HAVE THE ACTUAL DIR
HK AUDIO SYSTEM IS DISAPPOINTING LOUSY SPEAKERS ESP LACK OF BASS
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED AND I DON T FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN ACCURATELY DETECTING TRAFFIC PROBLEMS
JUST THE ISSUE OF THE PHONE CONNECTIVITY NOT ALLOWING CALLER TO HEAR DRIVER S VOICE
TOUCH SCREEN NAVIGATION AND ENTERTAINMENT
VOICE RECOGNITION SOFTWARE DOESN T ALWAYS WORK
VOICE COMMANDS SHOULD INTERPET ANY AVERAGE SPOKEN COMMAND NOT ONLY THE PROGRAMMED COMMANDS
ABILITY TO BROWSE PHONE MEDIA LIBRARY VIA BLUETOOTH USING THE IDRIVE SYSTEM
SOMETIMES THE VOICE COMMAND HAS A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING ME
APPS AREN T ANYTHING OF VALUE
MY NEW IPHONE DOESN T FIT INTO THE EXPENSIVE PHONE JACKET I BOUGHT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO I M NOT SURE HOW TO CONNECT MY PHONE TO THE CAR S ANTENNA NOW OR IF I CAN THAT COULD BE BETTER EXPLAINED AS COULD WHETHER BMW WITH BE OFFERING A PHONE JACK
USB PORT BE OUTSIDE OF THE CENTER CONSOLE
I WAS SURPRISED AT THE LACK OF A TOUCH SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION INSTRUCTIONS HAVE TOO MANY LAYERS STEPS TO ENTER POINTS OF DESTINATION CANNOT SIMPLY STATE COMMANDS LIKE ROUTE HOME OR ROUTE TO 123 MAIN ST SMITHVILLE OHIO
THE CAR S VOICE THAT PROVIDES INSTRUCTIONS WHEN USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM COULD BE LOUDER THE DEALER SAYS THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM BECAUSE I HAVE AN ANDROID PHONE
DIFFICULT TO GO TO NEXT TRACK USING THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ALSO THE AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE STEERING WHEEL WHICH IS NOT INTUITIVE
MOVING AROUND SWITCHING BACK IN FORTH BETWEEN RADIO NAVIGATION ETC IS NOT SMOOTH A LITTLE COMBERSOME
THE NAV SYSTEM
JUST USE MY IPHONE
USABILITY ISSUES APPS DON T WORK I CANNOT GET EMAIL MESSAGES WITH IPHONE 5S AUDIO DOESN T ALWAYS PLAY WELL THROUGH BLUETOOTH TOUCHSCREEN WOULD BE VERY DESIRABLE VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY
BMW ONLINE CONNECTION FAILED OR NOT AVAILABLE MOST OF THE TIME OVER THE LAST MONTH THIS ALLOW THE CAR TO DISPLAY THE WEATHER OF CURRENT LOCATION WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FEATURES SO HAVING THIS ISSUE WAS A BIG DEAL FOR ME
NAVIGATION CONFUSING AT TIMES WITH TOO A LOT OF OPTIONS
VOICE RECOGNITION BMW SHOULD LEARN FROM JAPAN OR USA TOO COMPLICATED
SOMETIMES THE BLUETOOTH IS A LITTLE SLOW TO RECOGNIZE MY PHONE BUT VOICE COMMANDS WORK FAST GOOD OVERALL
WHEN ATTACHING IPHONE IT DEFAULTS TO IPOD MUSIC INSTEAD OF ACTIVE APP SUCH AS AUDIBLE EVEN IF AUDIBLE IS PLAYING
THE RADIO   NAVIGATION HAS SPLIT SCREEN FOR SHOWING BOTH ITS ARDUOUS TO SET UP AND REMOVE FROM EITHER RADIO NAVIGATION OR SPLIT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TOGGLE BETWEEN THEM RADIO STATIONS ARE HARD TO SET WITHOUT TOGGLING UP   DOWN THE ON SCR
ADDING THE ABILITY TO SEND READ TEXTS ON MY SMARTPHONE WOULD BE A BIG IMPROVEMENT
THERE WERE ISSUES WITH COMPATIBILITY WITH SOME I POD MODELS THAT CAUSED YOU TO HAVE TO RESET YOUR I POD YOU ARE REQUIRED TO ENTER ADDRESSES INTO THE NAV SYSTEM IN A STRANGE ORDER
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE MORE CURRENT WITH THE MAPS IT WILL TELL ME TO EXIT THE HIGHWAY GO LEFT THEN MAKE A U TURN INSTEAD OF JUST GOING RIGHT WHICH IS LEGAL AND PREFERRED IT ALSO DOES NOT RECALCULATE CORRECTLY AT TIMES WANTING YOU TO
THE DEALERSHIP OR SUBARU NEED TO SET UP CLASSES TO EXPLAIN AND TEACH THE USERS HOW TO UTILIZE ALL THE FEATURES THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT AS TECH SAVY AS THE YOUNGER GENERATION HAVE DIFFICULTY PERFORMING OR UTILIZING ALL THE FUNCTIONS OF THE NAVIG
NAVIGATION INACCURACIES COULD BE IMPROVED WE HAVE USED A GARMIN DEVICE IN OUR OTHER CARS AND IT WORKED FLAWLESSLY
NAV IS NOT INTUITVE
CONNECTIVITY WITH THE IPHONE 6 IT DOES NOT WORK WITH MUSIC DUMP YOUR SYSTEM AND ADOPT AN INTERFACE DIRECTLY WITH THE CELL PHONE USE THEIR SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE SYSTEM UPGRADES SHOULD BE FREE
THE SPEAKERS ARE TERRIBLE EACH SOURCE SOUNDS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THROUGH THE HEAD UNIT SO EQUALIZER HAS TO BE RESET WHEN SELECTING
I HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAIR UP MY IPOD WITH THE BLUETOOTH I LL HAVE TO GET MY KIDS TO DO THAT
APPLE CARPLAY AND GOOGLE ANDROID AUTO INTEGRATION
SPEAKERS SEEM WEAK VOICE RECOGNITION TAKES FOREVER
HARD TO PUSH THE TOUCHSCREEN AND GET IT TO WORK THE FIRST TIME
TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT VERY RESPONSIVE AT TIMES MUST USE TOUCH SCREEN TO FINE TUNE CHANNELS AND PHONE CONTACTS DO NOT SAVE ON THE VEHICLE DIRECTORY EVEN THOUGH IT WAS UPLOADED AND SYNCED BLUETOOTH MIC DOESN T WORK VERY WELL
LOCATION OF USB CONNECTIONS IN CENTER CONSOLE IS AWKWARD
TOUCH SCREEN IS CUMBERSOME DIFFICULT TO TOUCH ACCURATELY WHEN CAR IS MOVING
I ENJOY THE ABILITY TO TALK TO SOMEONE ON MY CELL PHONE WHILE DRIVING THROUGH THE SOUND SYSTEM
SOUND QUALITY IS REALLY BAD AND THE HEAD UNIT LOOKS LIKE IT S FROM 90 S ALL THINGS CONSIDERED ITS REALLY BAD BUT IT DOESN T SEEM LIKE SUBARU REALLY CARES AS IT S THE SAME UNIT THEY VE BEEN PUTTING IN THE CAR FOR YEARS NOW
SOUND QUALITY WITH BLUETOOTH HANDS FREE
IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION DOWNLOAD PHONE BOOK TO USE AS SOURCE FOR NAMES GET RID OF HAVING TO RECORD EACH NAME INDIVIDUALLY VERY ANNOYING
OFFER A NAVIGATION AUDIO SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT COST 2500 DOLLARS OUT OF REALITY
THE FACTORY UNIT IS A A JOKE WITH FLAT SOUNDING SPEAKERS THAT QUICKLY DISTORT THE HEAD UNIT CONTROLS DISPLAY IS UNAPPEALING BUT AT LEAST EASY ENOUGH TO OPERATE BLUETOOTH WORKS FINE FOR AUDIO AND CALLS BLUETOOTH WILL NOT ALWAYS AUTO CONNECT TO D
IT IS AN AVERAGE STOCK AUDIO SYSTEM EASY TO OPERATE AND SOUND IS OK FOR STOCK BLUETOOTH CONNECTION HAS A DELAY
HONESTLY I DON T USE IT EXCEPT FOR WEATHER UPDATES IN THE MOUNTAINS I REALLY DON T HAVE MUCH USEFUL TO SAY ABOUT IT
SOUND QUALITY AND VOLUME OF RADIO COULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED
THE BLUETOOTH CONTROLS FOR LISTENING TO MUSIC ON DEVICES SHOULD INCLUDE A PAUSE PLAY BUTTON INSTEAD THERE ARE ONLY SEEK AND VOLUME CONTROLS
SKIPPING THROUGH SONGS ON EXTERNAL DEVICE IPOD WITHOUT THE SONG CHANGING WRX HAD THIS ABILITY
IT REALLY IS PRETTY GOOD ALTHOUGH ANDROID CONNECTIVITY SHOULD BE THERE
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE EVEN NOW THAT I AM USE TO THE SYSTEM I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DESIGNED
AS STATED BEFORE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO MUTE THE NAV AUDIO I OFTEN WANT TO USE THE NAV FOR ETA COMPARING ROUTES ETC AND DON T WANT OR NEED AUDIO TO KEEP INTERRUPTING MY MUSIC LISTENING EXPERIENCE EVEN ON VOLUME SETTING OF 1 IT STILL MUTES
FM SOUND QUALITY IS WORSE THAN 2004 VW PASSAT I HAVEN T YET USED THE CD PLAYER
WOULD RECOMMEND DEALER HAVE YOU COME BACK TWO WEEKS AFTER PURCHASE TO REVIEW DETAILS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM SO YOU HAVE TIME TO TRY IT AND GET QUESTIONS ANSWERED
BETTER GLARE REDUCTION ON NAVIGATION RADIO TOUCH SCREEN OFTEN CANNOT EVEN SEE THE RADIO STATIONS DUE TO GLARE
LIKE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED PERHAPS THE SATELLITE RADIO COULD STORE SONGS AND BE ABLE TO REWIND PLAYED MUSIC I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SCAN THROUGH ALL MY FAVORITE SATELLITE STATIONS QUICKLY INSTEAD OF LIMITED TO THE 5 THAT ARE ON CURRENT DI
ABILITY TO IMPORT ADDRESSES FROM PHONE WOULD BE NICE
PRESETTING AM FM STATIONS SHOULD BE EASYER
HARMAN AUDIO SYSTEM IS AMAZING APPLE CARPLAY APP IS NEEDED TO WORK WITH IPHONE AND SO FAR NOT AVAILABLE
VOICE COMMANDS WITH NAV NEED A COMPLETE OVERHAUL AS I CAN NOT USE VOICE COMMANDS CHANGING AUDIO SOUND SETTINGS COULD BE EASIER TO USE
HAVE A BETTER NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT WILL ACTUALLY TAKE ME TO MY DESTINATION ALSO VOICE COMMAND NEVER WORKS THIS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM JUST SAYS TRAFFIC PROBLEM AHEAD WITH NO OPTIONS GIVEN MY OLD SYSTEM WOULD HELP FIND A BETTER ROUTE IT WAS OUTSTANDING THIS PRETTY MUCH WORTHLESS
THE USB OUTLET DOES NOT WORK WELL WITH MY GALAXY PHONE
VOICE RECOGNITION RARELY EVER UNDERSTANDS COMMANDS OR IT PAUSES AND REPEATEDLY ASKS TO REPEAT THE COMMAND I AM AS AMERICAN AS IT GETS AND SPEAK VERY CONCISE AND CLEAR IT JUST DOESN T GET IT I GAVE UP ON IT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DIDNT RECOGNIZE A VALID ADDRESS WHEN SEARCHING FOR DIRECTIONS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND AUDIO INTERFACE ARE LACKING THE SPEAKERS ARE GREAT AND THE FEATURES ARE GREAT BUT THE AUDIO LACKS EASE OF USE ITS HARD TO CONNECT BLUETOOTH FROM MY PHONE AND PLAY MUSIC THE OVERALL LOOK COULD BE SOME SOPHISTICATED THE
JUNK THE NAV SYSTEM AND RE DO IT COMPLETELY
POOR HANDS FREE VOICE COMMAND NOT NATURAL SPEAKING NEEDS MULTIPLE SINGLE PROMPTS VERY SLOW VERY SMALL SCREEN AND SMALL BUTTONS TO TAKE DRIVERS EYES OFF WHILE USING
NOT INTUITIVE I ALSO WISH THERE WAS A STANDARD EQUALIZER SETTING IN ADDITION TO MANUAL SETTINGS VOICE RECOGNITION TO JUST MAKE A PHONE CALL IS CUMBERSOME
WHEN USING PRESET ADDRESSES 5 AVAILABLE INDICATE WHAT IS THE PRESET ADDRESS TO MAKE SELECTION EASIER I HAVE TO TRY TO REMEMBER WHAT IS IN EACH PRESET
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS SLOW TO RESPOND I TRY TO AVOID USING IT
I HAVEN T NEEDED TO USE THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM SO I HOPE MY OVERALL RATING DOES NOT SKUE THE STATISTICS THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS FINE
BETTER GRAPHICS DON T USE VOICE RECOGNITION DON T NEED IT
VIDEO ONLY WORKS WHEN PARKED AND E BRAKE ON IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT WOULD WORK AT ALL TIMES IT IS LESS OF A DISTRACTION THAN SOME OF THE OTHER FEATURES LIKE THE NAVIGATION SHOWING POINTS OF INTEREST AND FOOD ON THE SCREEN
CONNECTIVITY WITH IPHONE IS LIMITED I VE SET IT UP MULTIPLE TIMES AND YET IT STILL FAILS TO CONNECT AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK TEXT MESSAGING IS NO LONGER SET UP ALSO IPHONE ONLY EVER RECEIVED TEXTS AND CANNOT SEND THROUGH THIS SYSTEM I HAVE A
THE STEERING WHEEL AUDIO CONTROLS ARE MUCH LESS CONVENIENT THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR SWITCHING SOURCE IS ESPECIALLY ANNOYING
BETTER SOUND QUALITY FROM RADIO CD
I DON T KNOW HOW TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS IN IT ISN T THE SAME EASE AS USING PRIOR SYSTEMS I HAVE INPUT SAVED ADDRESSES AND THEY WEREN T THERE WHEN I TRIED NEEDED TO USE THEM HAD TO PULL OVER TO INPUT INFO A HUGE PROBLEM IS NOT BEI
EASIER TO USE NAVIGATION
USEFULLNESS OF APPS IS NOT GREAT I DON T DO FACEBOOK TRUE WEB BROWSER WOULD BE NICE VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT PERFECTED
RADIO FUNCTION IS GREAT EASY TO USE GOOD SOUND XM ALSO EASY TO USE BUT MAY NOT RENEW AFTER FREE PERIOD EXPIRES NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH NAV SYSTEM RARELY PLACE PHONE CALLS USING BLUETOOTH BUT DO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE DIFFICULT TO UN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE MORE ACCURATE AND EASIER TO USE
SOUND QUALITY IS A BIG PROBLEM FROM CERTAIN SOURCES BLUETOOTH AUDIO SOUNDS VERY POOR BUT FM RADIO AND THE CD PLAYER SOUND GOOD XM RADIO SOUNDS HORRIBLE BUT I M NOT SURE IF THAT S BECAUSE OF THE XM RADIO SOURCE BUT EITHER WAY IT WAS SO BAD T
THE NAV SYSTEM IS FRUSTRATING DOESN T ALLOW YOU TO INPUT ADDRESSES WHILE MOVING EVEN IF IT S THE PASSENGER ENTERING IT THE AUDIO SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO ACCESS MY AUDIO FILES ON MY SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 VERY WELL
TOUCH SCREEN HEAD UNIT STANDARD WOULD BE IDEAL
HANDS FREE PHONE DIAL BY NAME DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MOST OF THE TIME
UNACCEPTABLE SPEAKER SOUND QUALITY VERY VERY POOR SOUND I VE REPLACED THE SPEAKERS ALREADY
OVERALL SOUND QUALITY STRUGGLES HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION FEELS LIKE A SHOUTING MATCH
YOU CANNOT CHANGE ROUTES ON THE FLY YOU HAVE TO STOP YOUR VEHICLE TO WORK THE NAVIGATION CONTROLS A PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ALTER ROUTES WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION
BETTER DISPLAY FOR AUDIO AND INTEGRATION OF APPS FROM PHONE OR DEVICES THAT CAN BE UPLOADED TO THE DISPLAY
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY BASIC AND IS THE SAME AS MOST NAVIGATION SYSTEMS I HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST 10 YEARS THE TOUGH SCREEN WORKS FINE BUT IS A LITTLE SLOW AT TIMES THE GRAPHICS ARE BELOW AVERAGE FOR TECHNOLOGY IN THE TRAFFIC UPDATES
VOICE RECOGNITION IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE SCREEN SHOULD BE LARGER MORE APPS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE CAN NOT CHANGE DESTINATION WHILE DRIVING I KNOW IT IS A SAFETY FEATURE BUT WHAT IF YOU D LIKE A PASSENGER TO CHANGE IT THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST
TOUCH SCREEN RADIO HAS LOTS OF EMPTY SPACE REDESIGN NEEDED TO UTILIZE THE SPACE MORE EFFICIENTLY AND PROVIDE BIGGER BUTTONS FOR CERTAIN POPULAR FUNCTIONS RATHER THAN HAVING A LOT OF EMPTY SPACE PLEASE KEEP THE MECHANICAL VOLUME KNOB IT IS EASIE
AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY TOUCH SCREEN IS WAY TO COMPLICATED TO OPERATE WHILE DRIVING ITS AS BAD AS TEXTING WHILE DRIVING
MAP MUST DARKEN AT NIGHT STREET AHEAD DIALOG BOX SEE GARMIN S GPS
HAVEN T REALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND VOICE RECOGNITION YET BUT ITS NOT AS EASY TO BEGIN USING AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
THE FM RADIO RECEPTION IS VERY POOR WORST I HAVE EVER HAD
AUDIO FOR NAV MISINTERPRETS
PAIRING MULTIPLE PHONES VIA BLUETOOTH
VOICE COMMAND RESPONSE SHOULD BE FASTER AND MORE RELIABLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ADJUSTMENTS ARE MOSTLY DISABLED WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING
SO MUCH INFORMATION IN INSTRUCTION BOOKLET OFTEN USING UNFAMILIAR TERMS TO SOMEONE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IPHONES
HANDS FREE PHONE VOICE AUDIO QUALITY IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE MOST OTHER ASPECTS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM ARE FINE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM GUIDANCE VERY POOR WASTE OF MONEY SHOULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN THAT OPTION BUT PURCHASED AN AFTER MARKET GPS TO MOUNT ON DASHBOARD THEY DO MUCH BETTER
I DON T LIKE THE AUDIO SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION FEATURE DOESN T RARELY UNDERSTANDS ME SOUND GETS LOWER SOMETIMES WHEN PLAYING MUSIC WITH OUT ME LOWERING THE VOLUME HD SOUND ALSO TURNS ON AND OFF ON IT OWN
STEREO SYSTEM SPEAKERS ARE ANEMIC NEED MORE SPEAKERS IN VEHICLE LIKE THE TOYOTA VENZA JBL SYSTEM
MICROPHONE FOR HANDS FREE CALLS
THE NAVIGATION COULD BE MORE ACCURATE AND VOICE COMMANDS ARE NOT ALWAYS ACCURATE
NEEDS TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO VOICE COMMANDS
VOICE COMMAND AND I DONT JIVE WELL ITS LIKELY MY FAULT
OVERALL SOUND QUALITY IS THE MOST GLARING WEAKNESS
CANT USE ALL THE FEATURES WHILE MOVING FOR EXAMPLE TRIED TO HAVE MY PASSENGER ENTER A DESTINATION INTO THE NAV SYSTEM BUT SAFETY CONTROLS WANTED US TO PULLOVER WE WERE ON AN INTERSTATE I SWITCHED OVER TO MY PHONE S NAV SYSTEM AND FOUND
USB CONNECTIVITY WITHOUT BLUETOOTH
NAVIGATION SYSTEM THEY SHOULD HAVE MADE A LITTLE LESS COMPLICATED AND UP TO DATE
USB WORKING FOR APPLE PRODUCTS
HANDS FREE PHONE AVAILABILITY
WE DON T LIKE TO AUDIO SYSTEM IN THE CAR WE NOW HAVE OR THE CAR WE JUST TRADED THEY WERE HARD TO OPERATE
NAVIGATION SYSTEMS SOME TIMES FREEZING
A BETTER EXPLAINATION OF HOW TO USE IT I AM NOT FAMILIER WITH SOME TECHNOLOGY I LIKE THE VOICE CONNECTION AND HAVE USED IT ONLY ONCE I ALSO MADE A CALL FROM THE CAR TO MY HOME PHONE ONCE WITH SUCCESS SOMETIMES IT SHOWS MY PHONE AS CONNECTED
AUDIO COMMAND SYSTEM FOR VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVING
SOUND QUALITY OF INCOMING BLUETOOTH PHONE CALLS
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVEMENT AS DO THE MAPS HAVE HAD SOME AMUSING RESULTS
TOYOTA SHOULD OFFER A PROGRAM TO NEW OWNERS ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGES ON THEIR CARS WE WERE LEFT TO FIGURE IT OUT ON OUR OWN
FASTER RESPOND TIMES WOULD BE GREAT ON CONTROLS ESPECIALLY THE BLUTOOTH CONNECTIONS
SPEAKER UPGRADE WOULD DO WONDERS FOR IMPROVING THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM OF THE CAR OTHER ASPECTS WORK GREAT AND I FOUND THEM EASY TO USE
THERE ARE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WITH SOME ANDROID DEVICES MOSTLY FOR BLUETOOTH MESSAGING AND USB
AS MENTIONED BEFORE I M FRUSTRATED WITH VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM
EASE OF SETTING A DESTINATION
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN USING DESTINATION COMMAND
CONTROLS FOR HEATING AND AIR CONDITIONER CONSTANTLY HIT CONTROLS WHEN WORKING AUDIO AND NAVIGATION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE
SIMPLIFY NAVIGATION PROGRAMMING INSTRUCTIONS IN BOOK MY GARMIN WAS EASIER TO PROGRAM
I DON T HAVE SOME OF THESE OPTIONS BUT DO LIKE THE HANDS FREE FOR PHONE
NEEDS A BETTER GPS SYSTEM MY PORTABLE TOM TOM IS BETTER
THE BLUETOOTH PHONE AUDIO QUALITY IS BAD
MAKE IT EASIER TO MUTE THE PHONE CALL SO IT ONLY FEEDS TO THE PHONE THIS IS BECAUSE THE PASSENGER OFTEN TAKES THE CALLS AND DOES NOT WISH TO BROADCAST THEM
DONT HAVE NAVAGATION SYSTEM
IMPROVE SOUND QUALITY WHEN PLAYING MUSIC
SOUND QUALITY IS ONLY FAIR AVALON LIMITED HAS MUCH BETTER SOUND
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS HAS VERY POOR SOUND REAR AND FRONT DOOR SPEAKERS SOUND HORRIBLE OVERALL THE SYSTEM IS NOT LIKED FOR SUCH AN EXPENSIVE CAR
NEED TO PRACTICALLY SCREAM TO GET VOICE COMMAND TO GET REQUEST RIGHT
PASSENGER VOICE RECOGNITION
WHEN YOU DO NOT WANT THE SCREEN DISPLAYED YOU LOSE THE CLOCK THE CLOCK SHOULD ALWAYS BE ON OR SHOULD BE LOCATED SOMEWHERE ELSE AND NOT PART OF THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM
I DID NOT HAVE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH UNTIL THIS CAR IT SEEMS HARDER FOR EACH PARTY IN THE CONVERSATION TO HEAR WHEN I USE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH
DUMP THE HORRIBLE NAVIGATION AND USE GOOGLE READ PREVIOUS COMMENTS ALLOW MAKE AVAILABLE FOR INTEGRATION OR INSTALLATION MORE APPLICATIONS PODCAST APPLICATIONS SUCH AS POCKETCASTS IN ADDITION TO PANDORA ALTERNATE MUSIC APPLICATIONS SPOTIFY
IT SEEMS THAT WHEN TRYING TO USE THE HD PART OF THE AM HD OR FM HD RADIO THE HD SEEMS TO FADE IN AND OUT MOST OF THE TIME I FINALLY JUST USE THE AM AND FM RADIO WITHOUT THE HD DUE TO THE FACT IN FADES IN AND OUT ALL THE TIME
VOLUME CONTROL ON STEERING WHEEL
BETTER SOUND QUALITY WHEN USING HANDS FREE DEVICE THIS COULD BE IMPACTED BY REDUCING EXTERNAL ROAD NOISE
ENTUNE COULD BE GOOD BUT YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY REFRESH THE APP NEEDS TO AUTOMATICALLY CONNECT AND WORK WITHOUT INTERVENTION USUALLY USE BLUETOOTH ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE PHONE NOTIFICATION SOUNDS COME THROUGH WHEN IT IS CONNECTED REGARDLE
I WISH THE HEATER WOULD HEAT UP A LITTLE FASTER BUT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THE DELAY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS SAT OUTSIDE ON COLD NIGHT
NO INTERRUPTIONS IN PHONE CALLS FROM OTHER APPLICATIONS
ENTERING DESTINATIONS IN THE NAVIGATION IS A PAIN BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE PARKED PASSENGER CANNOT ENTER THE ADDRESS AND I DON T LIKE HOW IT ELIMINATES LETTERS AS YOU GO IT WOULD JUST BE FASTER TO TYPE IT IN MANUALLY
I HAVEN T FOUND THE RADIO SYSTEM OVERLY GREAT BUT THEN I DON T LISTEN TO THE RADIO MUCH SO IT IS NOT A BIG DEAL I AM MORE LIKELY TO LISTEN TO CD S
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE MORE INTUITIVE LIKE GARMIN
BETTER SOUND QUALITY
THE VOICE RECOGNITION AND INTUITIVENESS OF CONTROLS
IF THE PHONE WOULD CONNECT AND SYNC VIA BLUETOOTH MORE CONSISTENTLY AND EASILY AND IF IT WERE EASIER TO CALIBRATE THE VOICE CONTROL SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND ME
GOOD INSTRUCTIONS ON NAV SYSTEM OR DEALER HELP
CLEARER ON HOW TO SET USE PRESETS
VISUALS ON TOUCH SCREEN ARE HARD TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING JUST A VERTICAL LIST OF BLOCKS WOULD BE EASIER TO SELECT FROM RATHER THAN DIAGONAL FLOW LIKE VISUALS WHEN SHOWING DIFFERENT MODES
LESS SCREENS TO NAVIGATE THRU TO CHANGE DEVICES AND WHEN CHANGING FROM AM TO FM TO AUDIO FOR DEVICES
CHANGE FLAT BUTTONS ON STEERING WHEEL AUDIO CONTROLS FOR MORE SIGHTLESS TACTILE FEEDBACK
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN SEARCHING FOR CONTACTS IS POOR PARTICULARLY IN MOTION ROAD NOISE IN THE LIKELY CULPRIT
MORE USER FRIENDLY NAVIGATION SYSTEM
I HAVE NOT STUDIED GUIDE BUT DO NOT FIND IT EASY TO SET A RADIO STATION THAT I WANT HAVE ONLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO SCAN UP AND DOWN DIAL
NAVIGATION SYSTEM HARD TO SET UP OR DELETE TOYOTA E TUNES  IS NOT WORKING AS I WOULD LIKE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SEEMS TO NEVER WORK FOR ME IT NEVER UNDERSTANDS NAMES AND I CAN T GET IT TO WORK WITH MY MUSIC DEVICE I END UP USING SIRI MORE
TOO MANY STEPS FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM STREAMLINE THIS OR IMPROVE VOICE RECOGNITION
THERE SHOULD BE A NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM
THE SPLIT SCREEN IS NOT NECESSARY I D PREFER A BIGGER MAP AND A SMALL AREA SAYING WHAT STATION OR SONG I AM LISTENING TO
TRAFFIC AND WEATHER REQUIRE FM HD OF WHICH THERE ARE NONE IN THIS AREA FOR US THE CELLULAR DATA SOURCE FOR THAT INFORMATION WOULD WORK BUT IT IS NOT AN OPTION
REMOVE DISABLE FEATURE IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS WORK EVEN AFTER TRAINING ALSO FRUSTRATING IS THAT THE CENTER CONSOLE TOUCHSCREEN IS VERY GLITCHY AT LEAST ONCE A DAY IT FREEZES UP AND WON T ACCEPT ANY TOUCH COMMANDS NON RESPONSIVE TO TOUCH BUT VOICE WORKS UNT
THE APPS ARE A LITTLE CONFUSING AND I CAN T SEEM TO SYNCH THEM WITH MY PHONE
FIX THE RESPONS PROBLEM WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN
SCREEN USAGE FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM TOO MUCH SPACE IS TAKEN UP BY THE SIGNS OF THE NEXT TURN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET RID OF THOSE TEMPORARILY SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOU RE GOING THE YOU ARE HERE ARROW SHOULD HAVE AN OPTION TO HAVE THAT AT TH
SOUND QUALITY OF CALLS COULD BE BETTER
IT IS THIS WAY TOUCH SCREEN IS A PAIN IN THE ASS DIFFERENT FROM THE OLD WAY OF USING A KNOB TO CHANGE THE STATION YOU COULD RUN UP AND DOWN THE DIAL AND LISTEN TO WHAT YOU LIKE FINDING RADIO STATIONS THE WAY IT IS NOW TAKES TOO MUCH THOUGHT A
HAVE NOT YET USED VOICE RECOGNITION DUE TO TIME REQUIRED TO SET UP STILL PLAN TO DO SO TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS ARE NOT ALWAYS RESPONSIVE
NAVIGATION IS A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED ALSO TOYOTA DOESN T SUPPORT IPHONE TEXTING WHICH I FIND BARBARIC IN TODAYS ENVIRONMENT MY BLACKBERRY WORKS WELL WITH IT BUT IPHONE DOESN T WORK AT ALL FOR TEXTING
WISH IT HAD WEATHER CHANNEL I DO NOT HAVE A SMART PHONE WITH INTERNET AND WEATHER WOULD BE HELPFUL
SETTING UP RADIO STATIONS IS TOO QUIRKY AND DIFFICULT PRESSING AND HOLDING DOESN T WORK RELIABLY OR CONSISTENTLY AND TRYING TO CHANGE THE ORDER IS ARDUOUS
HARD TO CONTROL VOLUMNE WHEN USING VOICE CONTROLS FOR PHONE
NO NEED FOR CD PLAYER THESE DAYS NEED CELL PHONE MOUNTING SYSTEM
IT SEEMS COMPLICATED TO GET USED TO MOVING THROUGH CHANNELS TAKES FOREVER I M NOT SURE HOW TO SET FAVORITES
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO TURN OFF NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN DRIVING ALONE IT CAN BE EXTREMELY ANNOYING
LOVE BEING ABLE TO USE THE BLUETOOTH HANDS FREE CONNECTION WITH MY PHONE
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS VERY NICE THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND FOR THE FREE TRIAL VERSION OF SIRIUS XM RADIO WAS ONLY SO SO I WASN T THAT IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS A WASTE OF TIME TO USE AS A RESULT I USE MY PHONE FOR NAV AND PHONE CALLS
LOOK OF DISPLAY INCREASE FUNCTIONALITY NAVIGATION & MORE FLEXIBILITY WITH TRAFFIC APP
THE VOICE RECOGNITION COULD ACTUALLY WORK
THE CHANNEL SELECTION TOUCH SCREEN IS TERRIBLE WHENEVER I TOUCH A BOX RECTANGLE REPRESENTING A RADIO STATION THE SCROLL BAR IS OFTEN ACTIVATED INSTEAD AND THE SCREEN GOES OFF TO A WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF PRESETS THIS IS BOTH ANNOYING AND DISTR
TOO COMPLICATED FOR ANDROID
PLEASE SUPPORT THE DISPLAY OF CHINESE CHARACTERS ON THE PANEL WHEN I PLAY A CHINESE SONG THE PANEL CANNOT DISPLAY THE SONG TITLE AND ARTIST S NAME CORRECTLY ALSO FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN I PLAY MUSIC FROM MY IPHONE 6 VIA BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
I FEEL LIKE THE SIRIUS XM RADIO IS LOUDER THAN FM OR IPOD EXAMPLE VOLUME LEVEL 20 IS LOUD ON SAT BUT NEED TO PUMP UP TO 25 28 ON FM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM A LITTLE CONFUSING
SOUND QUALITY OF PERSON YOU RE SPEAKING TO WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE FEATURE
IMPOSSIBLE TO READ TOUCHSCREEN IN BRIGHT DAYLIGHT
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST THE VOLUME ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM OR TO HAVE THE RADIO SOUND CUT OFF WHILE AUDIO NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS ARE BEING GIVEN
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE COMMANDS BETTER AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A MANUAL OF WHAT COMMANDS IT KNOWS SO THAT I WOULD KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO IT TO GET IT TO DO WHAT I WANT
I WOULD LIKE THE CAR TO BE A HOTSPOT SO I CAN GET ONLINE WITH MY LAPTOP IN THE VEHICLE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL AND I HAVE NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES HAVING IT UNDERSTAND ME OR MISGUIDING ME MY CHILDREN LOVE THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM THAT IS BUILT IN MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS TO HAVE IT SOMEHOW WIRED TO HAVE THE ADULTS ABLE TO LIST
PEOPLE SAY I AM NOT REAL EASY TO UNDERSTAND ON THE PHONE WHEN I USE THE HANDS FREE DEVICE THEREFORE I RARELY USE IT WE HAD A DVD INSTALLED AFTER PURCHASE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD USE FREE BI ANNUAL MAP UPDATES ALSO THE ENTUNE APP FOR THE IPHONE IS PRETTY WELL USELESS I TRIED USING IT FOR THE PANDORA FEATURE BUT FOUND IT EASIER TO JUST OPEN PANDORA VIA BLUETOOTH AND LISTEN TO MY MUSIC THAT WAY
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THAT MY PHONE WOULD NOT CONNECT FOR TEXT MESSAGING I CALLED FOR HELP BUT I DON T THINK MY PHONE IS CAPABLE THE PHONE CALLS WORK GREAT
PHONE CONNECTION VIA BLUETOOTH IS SPORATIC AND DOESN T ACCEPT MORE THAN ONE PHONE SOMETIMES ONE PHONE CONNECTS WITH MUSIC AND THE OTHER FOR PHONE AND IT S CONFUSING THE VOLUME DIAL IS SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE I VERY MUCH DISLIKE THE VIE
LOCATION OF THE DVD PLAYER LOW ON MIDDLE OF DASH YET DRIVER MUST LOAD THE DVD
THE TOUCH SCREEN SHOULD HAVE A SIMPLE OFF BUTTON LOCATED ON STEERING WHEEL ON ALL MENUS OF TOUCH SCREEN ITS ANNOYING THAT YOU HAVE TO GO INTO SETTINGS TO SELECT DISPLAY OFF JUST TO TURN OFF THE DISPLAY
WHEN I RECEIVE TEXTS ON MY PHONE WHEN CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DELAY SOMETIMES 10 MINUTES OR MORE UNTIL I AM NOTIFIED ON THE VEHICLE S DISPLAY
GIVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE ONE FEATURE ON THE WHOLE SCREEN PERMANENTLY MUSIC OR NAVIGATION
I DO NOT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN MY EYES ARE AWAY FROM THE ROAD TOO LONG WHILE LOOKING FOR THE CORRECT BUTTON PHYSICAL BUTTONS MAKE IT EASIER TO FEEL THE CORRECT BUTTON
IPHONE PLAT THROUGH SPEAKER WHEN CONNECTED
SPEAKERS COULD BE AND EQUALIZER COULD BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER
THE BLUETOOTH CALLING FEATURE IS VERY ECHO Y AND NOT GREAT SOUND QUALITY IT DOES NOT INTEGRATE WITH MY PHONE S ADDRESS BOOK
GPS BY GOOGLE ON IPHONE IS A GOOD BENCH MARK
RADIO SOUNDS DISTANT POOR SOUND QUALITY
THIS MAY BE SLIGHTLY OFF TOPIC BUT BY REDUCING CABIN NOISE THE QUALITY OF THE SOUND SYSTEM WOULD IMPROVE PHENOMENALLY IN ADDITION THE FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS VASTLY DIFFERENT DEPENDING UPON WHICH INPUT YOU USE FOR EX
NOT EASY TO SET UP POOR SPEAKERS NOT INTUITIVE CONFUSING STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
I DON T NEED A 200 PAGE MANUAL TO USE BY NAVIGATION SYSTEM VOLUME CONTROL ON RADIO TOO CLOSE TO SELECTIONS ON VIDEO SCREEN
KEEPS MUTING MY PHONE WHEN THE NAVIGATOR IS RUNNING
TOO MUCH DATA ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM HANDS FREE IS NOT USER FRIENDLY I SWITCHED PHONES AND HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO SET IN HANDS FREE MODE THE MANUAL IS USELESS TO EXPLAIN THE PROCEDURE ONE IS TOLD TO SEE 3 DIFFERENT SECTIONS TO UNDERSTA
I VE BEEN TOLD THE SOUND QUALITY OF PHONE MIC IS POOR
THE APPS ARE HARD TO USE THE SONG SELECTION AND NAVIGATION INTERFACE IS HORRIBLE AND SLOW
VOICE RECOGNITION GETS STUCK IN LOOP DOES NOT RECOGNIZE COMMANDS
VOICE COMMANDS ARE GARBAGE AND THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION WORKS 50% OF THE TIME
DOWNLOADED STARLINK AP FROM APPLE CAN T GET IT TO WORK DO NOT THINK IT IS APPLE S PROBLEM
WHEN USING BLUETOOTH TO PLAY MUSIC VIA MY CELL PHONE THE NAME AND ARTIST OF THE SONG DOES NOT UPDATE ON THE CARS SCREEN
THE ABILITY TO USE IPHONE S NAVIGATION APPS AND IMPROVED FUNCTION OF THE IPHONE SUBARU APP WOULD BE NICE
TOUCH SCREEN NOT VERY RESPONSIVE NOT ABLE TO USE IPOD EASILY WITH AUX CONNECTION
THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM ONLY ALLOWS ONE OUT OF 5 DEVICE CONNECTIONS AT ONCE I WOULD LIKE TO USE MY PHONE FOR CALLS AND A 2ND BLUETOOTH DEVICE FOR MP3 PLAYBACK WITH THE PHONE AS THE PRIMARY CONNECTION
THE VOICE RECOGNITION OFTEN DOESNT UNDERSTAND ME
HIGH END OPTION TOUCH SCREEN TOO SMALL VERY DIFFICULY TO USE AND THE UPGRADED SPEAKERS ARE VERY TINNY VERY DISAPPOINTED NOY WORTH THE MONEY
1 APPLE SHOULD DESIGN BECAUSE IT IS NOT INTUITIVE 2 THE SALESMAN GAVE ME A VERY BRIEF TUTORIAL WHEN THE CAR CAME IN IT WAS VERY BRIEF EITHER GIVE A CLASS OR MAKE THE SYSTEM INTUITIVE
IT IS A VERY SIMPLE SYSTEM BASICALLY RADIO AND PORT FOR IPOD THE QUALITY OF SOUND FOR EXTERNAL DEVICES IS VERY BAD
I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH BLUETOOTH AND USB SOMETIMES THEY WORK GREAT AND OTHER TIMES NOT AT ALL IT S KIND OF FRUSTRATING BC IT SEEMS VERY RANDOM AND IT S CONFUSING TO GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN LISTENING TO A PODCAST FROM MY PHONE AND USING T
VOICE COMMAND RECOGNITION FOR HANDS FREE PHONE MUST BE IMPROVED
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE TOUCH SCREEN THIS IS A SAFETY PROBLEM
I HATE TOUCH SCREEN
APPLICATIONS ARE HORRIBLE AHA ETC
NEED TO CONNECT IPHONE VIA USB FOR SOME FEATURES NO APPLE PLAY CANNOT NOT RUN GOOGLE MAPS OR WAZE THROUGH AUDIO SYSTEM I E CANNOT INTEGRATE MUCH LESS DISPLAY ON AUDIO SCREEN
VOIE RECOGNITION FOR TEXTING
MAKING THE NAVIGATION ADD TO FAVORITES EASY TO ACCESS NOT NAVIGATE THROUGH SEVERAL SCREENS TO FIND
HOW TO SET DEFAULT RADIO STATIONS
THE USER INTERFACE IT JUST IDIOTIC I COULD DESIGN A BETTER UI AND I DON T KNOW HOW TO CODE THE VOICE COMMAND IS A JOKE THE CONNECTED IPHONE APP STARLINK IS A WASTE OF EVERYONE S TIME IT DOES NOTHING RESPONSIVENESS OF THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM
NEEDS TO CATCH UP WITH APPLE CAR PLAY
I LOVE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY AS LONG AS I AM JUST DOING ONE TASK IT WORKS GREAT HOWEVER IF I AM TRYING TO SEND MULTIPLE VOICE TEXTS OR TRYING TO USE SIRI I HAVE MAJOR CONNECTIVITY ISSUES THE AUDIO TURNS ON AND OFF WHEN IT THINKS I
LARGER BUTTONS ON TOUCHSCREEN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DISAPPOINTING AND NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE LOTS OF REASONS WHY GOOGLE MAPS IS MUCH SUPERIOR MIRRORLINK JUST PLAIN DOES NOT WORK AS ACKNOWLEDGED BY SUBARU TOO BAD AS IT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT CONCEPT AN
CONNECTIVITY OF PHONE
EQ ON THE RADIO AND MORE POINTS OF INTEREST ON NAVIGATION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO LEARN
BETTER COMPATIBILITY WITH CELL PHONES IPHONE TO PLAY MUSIC FILES OR PANDORA
TOUCH SCREEN WHEN USING PANDORA
WOULD BE EXCITING TO BE ABLE TO USE SIRI THROUGH THE SUBARU ON THE IPHONE
THE NAVIGATION IS HARD TO USE
IM A LITTLE OLD FASHION SOMETIMES THERE MIGHT BE TOO MANY FEATURES I JUST NEED FM CD AND SOMETIMES AM WITH BLUETOOTH PHONE
BETTER WIRELESS SUPPORT FOR IPHONE APPS LIKE PANDORA WHICH REQUIRES PHONE BE PLUGGED IN TO USB AND PANDORA APP LAUNCHED ANDROID DEVICES WORK FULLY WIRELESSLY
WHEN SPEAKING IT SEEMS A PASSENGER HAS A HARDER TIME COMMUNICATING LOCATION OF MICROPHONE MAY BE BETTER PLACED NAVIGATION SYSTEM WILL SOMETIMES SEND YOU ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE NOT VERY ACCURATE AT TIMES
NAVIGATION NEEDS WORK NO SAT IMAGE SELECTING A DESTINATION IS A PAIN
I EXPECTED A HIGHER QUALITY SOUND SYSTEM I AM ALSO SURPRISED THAT THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS ESSENTIALLY NOT FUNCTIONAL
VOICE CONTROLS CAN BE DIFFICULT
HARD TO NAVIGATE AND CONTROL WHN DRIVING
VOICE RECOGNITION INITIALIZATION NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
NAVIGATION IS HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING
ITS HARD TO UNDERSTAND I DO NOT AT ALL UNDERSTAND THE VOICE SYSTEM AND THE NAVIGATION HAS BEEN A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT INTUITIVE PANDORA DOES NOT LOAD
THE NAVIGATION COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENT GOOGLE MAPS IS ABLE TO PROVIDE A MUCH MORE ACCURATE ESTIMATED TRIP LENGTH RIGHT OFF THE BAT WHEREAS THIS BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM OVERESTIMATES THE TIME INITIALLY AND ONLY BECOMES ACCURATE ABOUT 75%
VOICE RECOGNITION TO CONTROL PHONE AND OTHER FEATURES IS ALWAYS A LENGTHY PROCESS AND SOMETIMES FRUSTRATING
VOICE CONTROL IS BAD OTHERWISE TYPICAL OR GOOD QUALITY FOR A CAR SYSTEM
ALLOW ENTUNE SYSTEM TO WORK WHEN AN IPOD IS PLUGGED IN I VE FOUND ONLY ONE WILL WORK AT A TIME SO I CAN NOT USE ENTUNE WHILE DRIVING AND LISTENING TO THE IPOD
IMPROVE THE VOICE COMMAND OPERATION SYSTEM
SOUND QUALITY OF PHONE WHEN USING BLUETOOTH
LOCATION OF THE BUILT IN MICROPHONE
WHEN I HAVE MY PHONE CONNECTED TO BLUETOOTH AND A MESSAGE COMES IN THE NOTIFICATION IS EXTREMELY LOUD I HAVE TRIED VOLUME CONTROL BUT THAT DID NOT HELP IT ACTUALLY STARTLES YOU
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT VERY SENSITIVE OR WHEN I TRY TO CHOOSE FROM A LIST OF NAMES OR CHANNELS IT OFTEN GOES TO THE ONE ABOVE OR BELOW THE ONE I WANT AND I HAVE SMALL HANDS THE NAVIGATION IS A LENGTHY PROGRESS TO GET YOUR DESTINATION ENTERED
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT AS USER FRIENDLY AS OTHER AVAILABLE PRODUCTS NAVIGATION SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHANGE TO A NEW DESTINATION WHEN THE CAR IS MOVING BECAUSE THE PASSENGER CAN CHANGE THE DESTINATION VERSUS SAFETY LOCK FOR DRIVER VERY INCONVENIEN
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SEEMS A BIT COMPLICATED BUT WE ARE GETTING MORE USED TO IT NOW WORKS WELL WHEN IN SERVICE
SOUND QUALITY AS VERY AVERAGE AND DOESN T HAVE ANY DEPTH
THE NAVIGATOR S VOICE COMMAND NEEDS TO IMPROVE THE PHONE IS DIFFICULT HEAR THE CALLER MY LEXUS HAD BETTER CABIN AUDIO FOR THIS FEATURE IT SAYS I M SUPPOSE TO BE ABLE TO VOICE A REPLY TO MY EMAILS BUT IT DOESN T WORK
I DON T KNOW HOW TO USE THE TRAFFIC AND THE VOICE COMMAND IS POOR
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS A PLUS TOUCH SCREEN A BIT FAR AWAY FROM ME DRIVER S SEAT BUT I DON T HAVE THE LONGEST ARMS EITHER
NAVIGATION SETTINGS ARE NOT INTUITIVE
ALL IS FINE EXCEPT FOR THE QUALITY OF CALLS VIA BLUETOOTH NOBODY CAN HEAR ME WELL I HAVE TO SCREAM
I DID NOTICE THE LAST TIME I USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I MADE AN INCORRECT TURN THE SYSTEM DID NOT RE ROUTE ME OR ANYTHING
AS STATED PREVIOUSLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM WILL CONSISTENTLY GET MY WIFE S NAME NICKNAME INCORRECT OR NOT FIND IT AT ALL YA YA MY CELL PHONE LEARNS WHAT I SAY AND IN MY ACCENT I WOULD EXPECT THE CAR TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AS WELL
ENTUNE REALLY MESSED UP THIS RATING TOO HARD TO CONNECT YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ANOTHER APP WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE PANDORA YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE YOU PHONE S APP RUNNING IN ORDER TO PLAY YOU MUSIC
IT DOESN T HAVE MUCH VOLUME I DON T LIKE THAT SIRRIS IS BUILT INTO THE RADIO SYSTEM I M NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING TO STOP WORKING AFTER THE TEMP SUBSCRIPTION RUNS OUT IN A WEEK
BLUETOOTH AND USB
I NEED A GPS INSTALLED ON MY BESPOKE AUDIO MADE BY PIONEER
I DON T USE MODERN TECHNOLOGY I LIKE I CAN PRE SET MANY RADIO STATIONS TO THE CITIES I AM IN THAT DAY ALL I NEED IN A CAR IS RADIO AND CD PLAYER
AVAILABLE SIRIUS SATELLITE RADIO
WHEN SELECTING A DIFFERENT RADIO STATION I USUALLY HAVE TO TOUCH THE NEW SELECTION MULTIPLE TIMES
I D LIKE VOICE RECOGNITION CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL
SOUND QUALITY IS AVERAGE AT BEST
I REALLY DISLIKE THE TOUCHSCREEN FOR THE AUDIO DISPLAY THE ICON IS UGLY IT IS TOO BRIGHT AND DISTRACTING SO I FINALLY JUST TURNED IT OFF I WISH THAT I COULD REPLACE IT WITH A TRADITIONAL UNOBTRUSIVE SYSTEM
NON APPLE PRODUCT E G ANDROID OR OTHER MEDIA DEVICE INTEGRATION NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED WITH TODAY S TECHNOLOGY THE USE OF THE MEDIA DEVICE AS A DRIVE ONLY AND PROPER MENU CONTROLS AND INTERACTION OF THE STEREO UTILIZING THE DEVICES STORED MUSIC
NOT AUTOMATICALLY SEARCHING FOR HD RADIO ALLOWING THE DRIVER TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SEARCH FOR HD OR TO USE SD ONLY WHEN HD RADIO IS NOT AVAILABLE THE SOUND QUALITY SWITCH CAN BE ABRUPT AND CONSTANT CHANGES IN SOUND QUALITY BECOME ANNOYING READ
USING THE TOUCH SCREEN WHEN DRIVING IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS
ANDROID DOES NOT INTERACT WELL WITH THE HEAD UNIT THE INFORMATION ON SONGS AND PLAY LENGTH IS UNAVAILABLE HALF OF THE TIME IPHONE PAIRS A LOT BETTER WITH IT
COMPLAINTS FROM INDIVIDUALS WHEN USING HANDS FREE THAT DIFFICULTY IN HEARING ME ETC OFTEN HAVE TO HOLD THE PHONE INSTEAD OF HANDS FREE QUALITY OF INCOMING CALL IS LESS THEN EXPECTED AS WELL THIS IS THE 2ND VENZA I HAVE HAD AND I DO NOT REME
I VE ALREADY REPLACED THE PIONEER FACTORY SYSTEM WITH A NEW SOUND SYSTEM ALSO PIONEER I ADDED A SUB WOOFER AND TWO AMPLIFIERS AS WELL
SOUND QUALITY WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC IS POOR ALSO TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO READ ON A SUNNY DAY AND COMPLICATED TO USE FOR BASIC RADIO FUNCTIONS
BE ABLE TO USE ALL FEATURES WITHOUT DISCONNECTING THE IPOD FROM THE USB PORT
I HAVE TROUBLE FOLLOWING THE MAPS THAT COME UP WHEN GOING TO A SPECIFIC DESTINATION SOMETIMES THE CAR IS GOING TO THE RIGHT LEFT OR DOWN INSTEAD OF STRAIGT UP VERKY HARD TO FOLLOW
SORRY I AM NOT YOUNG AND I AM NOT CRAZY ABOUT TOYOTA TOUCHSCREENS
TOUCH SCREEN BUTTONS TO CHANGE RADIO STATIONS ARE TOO SMALL AND HARD TO PUSH AT BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN BIGGER BUTTONS WOULD BE NICE
A MORE IN DEPTH EQUALIZER WOULD BE NICE
I DON T KNOW IF I JUST HAVEN T FIGURED IT OUT YET BUT THE MAP SYSTEM DISPLAY LACKS SOPHISTICATION AND CLARITY I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT VOICE DIRECTIONS THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT I WAS NEVER GIVEN ANYTHING BUT A PAMPHLET NO DIRECTIONS NO LEARN
THE PAIRED APPLICATION THAT RUNS OF THE IPHONE NEVER SEEMS TO WORK I THINK IT S CALLED ENTUNE ALSO I HATE THAT I CANNOT MANUALLY ENTER AN ADDRESS WHILE THE VEHICLE IS MOVING
NOISE BETWEEN BLUETOOTH AND CELL PHONE CONNECTION
THE VOICE COMMAND BUTTON IS NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE WHEN DRIVING WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WAS LOCATED ON THE STEERING WHEEL OR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE OF RADIO
WHEN I ANSWER A PHONE CALL THROUGH THE AUDIO SYSTEM IT TAKES A WHILE TO CONNECT
BETTER BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY AUTOMATICALLY WITH MY IPHONE PREVIOUSLY I MISSTATED THAT I PUSH BAND FOR CONNECTING PHONE I SHOULD HAVE SAID I PUSH MEDIA QUITE OFTEN EVEN THOUGH MY IPHONE SETTINGS SAYS BLUETOOTH IS ON AND VW PHONE IS CONNECTE
TOUCH SCREEN NAVIGATION   MENUS
PASSENGER SHOULD BE ABLE TO ENTER INFORMATION INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION AS IT IS NOW ALL OPTIONS OF NAVIGATION ARE INOPERABLE WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION
I DON T KNOW I LOVE THE AUDIO AND HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION
OFFER UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM AS SINGLE OPTION I E ALLOW OPTION TO GET BETTER AUDIO WITHOUT HAVING TO GET NAVIGATION SYSTEM OR OTHER BUNDLED FEATURES
WHEN YOU TYPE IN AN ADDRESS UNDER THE ADDRESS SECTION IT WON T ALLOW YOU TO TYPE IN THINGS LIKE ROUTE OR HIGHWAY IT OVERRIDES WHAT YOU ARE TYPING BY ELIMINATING LETTERS ON THE KEYBOARD & OR OVER WRITING WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ENTER YOU HAVE
NAVIGATION DOES NOT ALLOW DRIVER TO ZOOM OUT FAR ENOUGH
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY WHEN SETTING UP
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SEEMS BASIC NOT MANY FEATURES
EVERYTHING SHOULD BE VOICE CONTROLLED MY OTHER CAR IS 4 YEARS OLDER AND IT HAS VOICE CONTROL
THE NAV SYSTEM IS WHAT NEEDS WORK IN BEING MORE SPECIFIC
NAVIGATION SYSTEM OLD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
THE VOICE CONTROL IS POOR AND NEVER RECOGNIZES ANYTHING I SAY
I BELIEVE THE SPEAKER SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED IT IS NOT AS CLEAR AS IT COULD BE I STILL FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM A BIT DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE NOT EASY TO GO BACK
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO COULD BE CONTROLLED BY THE CAR S CONTROLS RE SKIPPING A TRACK
THE VEHICLE COULD USE BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE CALLS PEOPLE I TALK TO FREQUENTLY SAY THERE IS AN ECHO THEY HEAR THEIR VOICE ECHOING BACK AS THEY RE SPEAKING
THE NAV IS A LITTLE CLUNKY WITH LOTS OF BACK AND FORTH TO GET TO EXACT ADDRESSES
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE UPDATED REGULARLY WITHOUT A FEE THIS IS BASIC AND I AM VERY SURPRISED THAT VW CHARGES FOR THIS IN ADDITION THE SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT EASY TO USE SO I END UP USING MY PHONE S NAV MORE THAN VW S NAVIAGTION
IMPROVED PHONE CALL SOUND QUALITY
PAIRING MY PHONE WITH THE BLUETOOTH TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK THE FIRST TIME OFTEN I USE IT TO USE FOR DIRECTIONS I AM NOT SURE HOW IT COULD BE IMPROVED I AM STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF IT IS USER ERROR
THE MICROPHONE IS VERY SENSITIVE AND MY WIFE TALKS LOUD SO IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS YELLING WHEN USING IT
BLUETOOTH NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
THE TOUCHSCREEN HAS A SMALL LAG IN TERMS OF RESPONSIVENESS
SPEAKERS COULD USE MORE BASS OR A SUB WOOFER COULD BE ADDED
BLUETOOTH FEATURE IS NOT VERY PERCEPTIVE TO MY VERBAL COMMANDS IN CALLING PEOPLE
GARMEN IS NOT AS INTUITIVE AS IT COULD BE IT COULD SKIP SOME SELECTIONS DOESN T HAVE ALL MY ADDRESSES ON ITS MAP VERY FUNCTIONAL THOUGH
PROBLEMS DISPLAYING MUSIC INFO ON IOS 8 DEVICES OCCASIONAL PROBLEMS SWITCHING SONGS WITH FORWARD BACK BUTTONS AND PLAY PAUSE WHEN CONTROLLING AN IPHONE WITH IOS 8
STILL HAVEN T USED SOME OF THESE SYSTEMS THE CD PLAYER MAY NOT BE TOO ACCESSIBLE I VE BEEN USED TO HAVING IT WITHIN THE DRIVER S REACH BUT I GUESS IT S BECOMING OBSOLETE
FENDER AUDIO IS VERY CLEAR
VOICE RECOGNITION SPOTTY
VOICE RECOGNITION AND USE OF EXTERNAL DEVICES IS HORRIBLE
THE GRAPHICS ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ARE SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSING IN A NEW VEHICLE
NAVIGATING THE TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE IS AWKWARD PARTICULARLY WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN MEDIA
AUX IN JACK
MAKE IT MORE LIKE APPLE S CARPLAY IT S A GOOD TRY VW BUT IT S HARD TO OPERATE IT S LAGGY THE TOUCHSCREEN ISN T RESPONSIVE AND THE DISPLAY IS SUPER LOW RES APPLE DOES SPOIL WITH THEIR RETINA DISPLAY S BUYING A $30K CAR SHOULD ALLOW FOR THAT
SOUND QUALITY OF AUDIO SYSTEM IS MEDIOCRE AT BEST
BETTER TOUCH SCREEN NEEDED
NAV SYSTEM IS OBSOLETE MAPS AND TRAFFIC INFORMATION ARE NOT ACCURATE NEEDS MODERN GPS FEATURES
COMPARED TO MAZDA 3 HEARING INCOMING CALLS AND NAVIGATION INSTRUCTIONS IS NOT AS CLEAR
PHONE SOUND QUALITY POOR ON OTHER END OF CALL
VOICE COMMAND RECONDITION TO CONNECT TO A INDIVIDUALS PHONE NUMBER
VOICE CONTROL IS FLAKY HANDS FREE AUDIO QUALITY IS SOMETIMES LACKING LONG DETECTION TIME FOR MOBILE PHONE WITH ENABLED BLUETOOTH
AGAIN THE VOICE REGOGNITION FEATURE IN THIS VEHICLE LEAVE A LOT TO BE DESIRED THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION PRODUCES AN ANNOYING ECHO ON THE OTHER PERSON S PHONE
CONNECTIVITY TO PHONE DOES NOT ALWAYS PAIR
THE PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM IS NOT AVAILABLE UNLESS YOU SPECIFY LEATHER SEATS SINCE I AM A VEGETARIAN I DON T WANT MY CAR TO SMELL OF LEATHER BUT THAT APPARENTLY MEANS I CAN T ENJOY THE BEST QUALITY AUDIO
GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE GUI LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM THE 1990 S WOULD RATHER NOT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM UNLESS IT IS TRULY USER FRIENDLY WITH LOOK AND FEEL SIMILAR TO WEB BROWSER CHROME IE FIREFOX ETC
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE BETTER COMMANDS ARE NOT INTUITIVE NAV SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO INPUT INFO
HAVE NOT YET STUDIED THE BOOKLET TO MAKE IT CLEARER HOW TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAV SCREEN SMALLEST OF AN CAR I OWN
RESPONSE TIME OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN INPUTTING ADDRESS
IPOD CONTROLS COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
SHOULD USE A STANDARD USB CONNECTOR INSTEAD OF A VW SPECIFIC CABLE
THE SYSTEM TAKES TOO LONG TO BOOT UP I LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA FUNCTION BUT I MAY HAVE COMPLETED BY BACKUP BEFORE THE SYSTEM FINISHES BOOTING
TOUCHSCREEN INTERFACE IS SMALL AND RATHER DATED
VOICE RECOGNITION HAS DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING SOME NAMES
IT TAKES A LITTLE LONG FOR MY IPHONE TO CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH EACH TIME I START THE CAR TAKES ABOUT A MINUTE
THERE IS A DISTINCT DELAY BETWEEN THE TIME I START THE CAR AND THE TIME THE IPOD BEGINS TO PLAY THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM MY 2003 JETTA WAGON WHICH DIDN T HAVE THIS PROBLEM THE XM RADIO STATIONS HAD SPOTTY RECEPTION IN MY COUNTY THE INTERFACE BETW
TOUCH SCREEN IS SLOW TO RESPOND ANNOYING THAT THE ENTIRE SYSTEM TAKES ABOUT A MINUTE TO START WHEN THE CAR STARTS HAVE TO WAIT TO START MUSIC OR BE ABLE TO BACK UP BC CAMERA DOESN T START INSTANTLY
NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND TRAFFIC PATTER COLORS ARE VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND GIVEN THE ISSUES I VE HAD WITH MY BT CONNECTIVITY AND THE MUSIC DELAYS IT S HARD FOR ME TO RATE THE SYSTEM BETTER THAN AVERAGE
THERE IS NOW VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE RADIO OR NAVIGATION SYSTEM THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT IN A $34 000 CAR
IT SHOULD HAVE BETTER SOUND QUALITY NAVIGATION SHOULD HAVE LIVE TRAFFIC
SOMETIMES LAGS WHEN LOADING FILES FROM AN AD CARD OR IPOD
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY ERRATIC IN IT S TOUCH SOMETIMES IT TURNS WHITE IMMEDIATELY WITH A GENTLE TOUCH OTHER TIMES I HAVE TO PRESS HARD SOMETIMES SEVERAL TIMES I FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO FIND WHAT I M LOOKING FOR ESPECI
EVERYONE I CALL SAY THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR ME I HAD THIS SAME PROBLEM IN MY LAST PASSAT I LIKED THE DISPLAY OF THE RADIO WITH MY PASSAT THE ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLE WAS MUCH BETTER IN THAT VEHICLE I DID NOT NEED THE NAVIGATION BUT
AUDIO SYSTEM SOUNDS EXCELLENT GREAT SPEAKER PLACEMENT PLAYS LOUD ENOUGH FOR OUR TASTE AND LISTENING SUB WOOFER WOULD BE A PLUS
MY FAVORITE RADIO STATION DOES NOT COME IN AT ALL ALL OTHER CARS THAT I HAVE OWN DO CONNECT WITH IT
WILL NOT ALLOW MAPS OR GOOGLE MAPS TO PLAY THROUGH BLUETOOTH CAR SPEAKERS
TAKES TOO LONG TO STARTUP AND BLUETOOTH SYNC
VOICE TEXTING COMMANDS WOULD BE A REAL PLUS
THE CD PLAYER SHOULD BE ON THE DASHBOARD NOT IN THE GLOVE BOX
SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT THE INTERFACE IS DISTRACTING TO USE IT IS TOO DIFFICULT TO CHANGE MEDIA SOURCES TOO MUCH OF THE DISPLAY IS FOR SHOWING SONG ETC MORE AREA OF THE DISPLAY SHOULD USED FOR BUTTONS CHANGE DIRECTORY ETC THIS WOULD MAKE TH
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MORE ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE THE VOICE CONTROLS COULD BE EASIER TO USE AND THE SYSTEM COULD RECOGNIZE SPEECH BETTER
CD PLAYER LOCATION
1 OPTION TO ALLOW AUTOMATIC SETTING TO DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME AND DISABLING DST AT THE APPROPRIATE TIMES IN THE YEAR 2 BE ABLE TO EASILY AND SAFELY SHUT OFF ROUTE GUIDANCE IN NAVIGATION WHILE DRIVING 3 BE ABLE TO EASILY AND SAFELY ADJUST VOLU
NEEDS TO HAVE USB
RELOCATE THE CD PLAYER
MAKE IT LESS PROPRIETARY PORTS IT SHOULD BE JUST AN EXTENSION OF A SMARTPHONE AND NOT TRY TO COMPETE WITH IT ON FEATURES
MORE WRITTEN DETAILS IN OWNER MANUAL FOR USING COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS
ENTERING THE DATA IS SLOW USING THE TOUCHSCREEN OPTIONS TO AVOID EXPRESSWAYS TOLLS OR THE DIRECT ROUTE NOT AVAILABLE AFTER THE ROUTE IS CALCULATED ALTERNATE ROUTES COULD BE SHOWN TO DECIDE WHICH ROUTE TO TAKE I DON T KNOW IF MY NAVI SYSTEM
THE SOUND QUALITY OF PHONE CALLS AND THE MICROPHONE QUALITY PLACEMENT FOR PEOPLE ON A CALL FROM THE CAR
THE NAV SCREEN SHOULD BE LARGER ON A $40K VEHICLE IT IS WAY TOO SMALL
VOICE COMMAND FOR BLUETOOTH AUDIO NEEDED
BLUETOOTH PHONE QUALITY COULD BE BETTER
WHEN MAKING CALLS ON THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM I CAN ALWAYS HEAR THE OTHER PARTY PERFECTLY BUT THEY TELL ME EVERY TIME THAT THEY CAN NOT HER ME MY VOICE AND THEIR OWN VOICE ECHO BACK TO THEM WHEN I TURN THE BLUETOOTH OFF AND DISCONNECT FROM MY CAR
NAVIGATION EASE OF USE WOULD LOVE SIRI VOICE ACTIVATION LIKE PROGRAM
HANDS FREE PHONE SOUND QUALITY COULD BE BETTER STILL SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE IN A TUNNEL
THE CAR CAME WITH AN OLD IPOD IPHONE ADAPTER I HAD TO SEARCH ONLINE TO FIND THE REPLACEMENT THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM FOR NON ENGLISH LANGUAGE DISPLAY IS NOT SO GOOD CHARACTER SHOWS UP IN BOXES THE AUDIO PLUG IN IS NOT INTUITIVE ALL NEEDS TO
SYNCING TO STREAMING WEBSITES REMAINS A MYSTERY
VOICE CONTROL SEEMS NOT TO WORK
IPOD PLAYBACK THROUGH SENSUS IS SLOW AND APPEARS TO REBOOT WHEN YOU TURN ON THE CAR
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A BIT CUMBERSOME TO PROGRAM WHEN LOOKING UP POI S OR WITH SPECIFIC NAMES OF BUSINESSES IN THE AREA IT NEEDS TO BE MORE USER FRIENDLY AND BE ABLE TO FIND MORE POI WHEN GIVEN A CITY AND STATE WITHOUT HAVING TO ENTER THE FU
VISUAL DISPLAY IS UNATTRACTIVE & DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE
SD CARD INTERFACE IS AWFUL
I KEEP CHANGING RADIO STATIONS WHEN USING THE STEERING WHEEL
ONE OF THE BEST STEREO AND HD CAR SYSTEMS I HAVE EVER HAD INCLUDING A BLIND MUSICIAN WHO THINKS ITS THE BEST CAR STEREO
IT HAS AN MDI CABLE THAT CONNECTS WITH I PHONES BUT NOT WITH ANDROIDS I HAVE AN ANDROID AND WISH IT HAD THE SAME CONNECTIVITY
SPEED SPEED SPEED ALSO THE ABILITY TO NAVIGATE TO AN ADDRESS IN YOUR CONTACTS ON YOUR PHONE USING BLUETOOTH MANY FEATURES OF THE RADIO ARE LACKING WITH THIS ANCIENT SYSTEM FAVORITES DUAL SCREEN DISPLAY RADIO & MAP I COULD GO ON BUT YOU GE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD ACTUALLY WORK
MORE OPTIONS ON THE MAP
HARD TO ENTER ADDRESS IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM FAST
I WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE VOICE RECOGNITION AND ALL OF THE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL BUT THE MODEL CAME WITH IT INCLUDED
CAN I PAIR A BT KEYBOARD THAT THE PASSENGER COULD USE OR ME WHEN PROGRAMMING 4G CONNECTIVITY SHOULD BE IN THE CAR FOR
VOICE RECOGNITION IS PRETTY GOOD BUT COULD BE BETTER HARD TO USE WITH ADDRESSES SOMETIMES
THE ACCURACY OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS GREAT BUT THE LACK OF A TOUCH SCREEN IS NOT GREAT A TOUCH SCREEN SHOULD BE STANDARD
VOICE CONTROL IS FINICKY AND DOESN T RECOGNIZE AS ACCURATELY AS ONE WOULD LIKE
INPUTTING NAV VIA TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE FABULOUS
NAVIGATION IS NOT USER FRIENDLY
IT TAKES TOO LONG TO PROGRAM IN NEW DESTINATIONS TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ALSO THE DIAL USED TO PROGRAM IN DESTINATIONS IS NOT EASY TO USE IT SKIPS FROM LETTER TO LETTER TOO QUICKLY
THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS THROUGH THE SIRIUS CHANNELS ONLY SEEMS TO FLIP THROUGH USING THE DIAL ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SYSTEM WHEN I TRY TO FLIP SIRIUS CHANNELS USING THE LEFT RIGHT ARROWS ON THE STEERING WHEEL
TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE NICE
TOO MANY SEPARATE COMMANDS ARE NEEDED TO USE VOICE CONTROLS I WOULD LIKE TO SIMPLY SAY CALL JOHN DOE HOME RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO THROUGH MULTIPLE VOICE COMMANDS TO GET THERE AND WAITING FOR THE SYSTEM TO RESPOND TO EACH ONE
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM IS A SLOW PROCESS WOULD LIKE FEWER VOICE COMMANDS TO GET TO END RESULT PHONE CALL IS FASTEST MEDIA SEARCH IS TEDIOUS
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY TAKES A LONG TIME IT ALSO DROPS THE CONNECTION
TOO DIFFICULT TO ENTER AN ADDRESS INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ALSO TOO DIFFICULT TO FIND A CONTACT S PHONE NUMBER TO CALL THE OLDER VOLVO I USED TO HAVE A VOLVO WAS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE AND DID NOT INVOLVE ROLLING A WHEEL BACK AND FORTH T
ENTERING AN ADDRESS VIA VOICE CONTROL FOR NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS POOR VOICE COMMAND FOR A PHONE CALL TAKES TOO MANY STEPS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY SAY CALL BILL JONES IN ONE STEP RATHER IT FORCES YOU TO SAY CALL CONTACT WITH A DELAY THE Y

NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS INACCURATE HAVE BEEN TOLD BY DEALER SERVICE PEOPLE TO USE GOOGLE MAPS ON MY I PHONE FOR NAVIGATION
IMPUTING DATE TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE NAV FUNCTION TO SELECT POINTS OF INTEREST IS TEDIOUS TO USE BY SELECTION MENU AND FUNCTION TO SELECT POI ON MAP DOES NOT WORK WELL
USE OF VOICE COMMANDS VOICE OPERATION
INTERNET IS SPOTTY I LISTENT TO PANDORA THE MOST AND IT JUST CUTS OUT AND PAUSES DAILY
THE RADIO OR MUSIC SHOULD COMPLETELY STOP PLAYING WHEN INFORMATION FROM THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS PRESENTED DIRECTION FROM NAVIGATION IS TOO LOW
VEHICLE S APPS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE SYSTEM GETS STUCK LOADING AN APP AND THEN CANNOT MOVE OUT OF THE APP FEATURE AND BACK TO OTHER ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM OPTIONS LEADING ME TO AVOID USING THE APPS ALTOGETHER
THERE IS A DEEP LAYERED MENU SYSTEM THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MAKE CHANGES LIKE MAP ORIENTATION NORTH AT TOP VS DIRECTION OF CAR AT THE TOP YOU HAVE TO DRILL DOWN THROUGH MULTIPLE CHOICES TO FIND THE RIGHT CONTROL
TRAFFIC INFO DOES NOT WORK AND THE DEALERSHIP WAS NOT ABLE TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM I IMAGINE IF THIS FUNCTION WORKED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE BETTER THAN AVERAGE THE HARDWARE IS RATHER SLOW AND IT TAKES EASILY ALMOST 2 MIN TO TYPE IN 1 FU
IMPROVE THE VOICE CONTROL ASPECT OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM I E LESS STRUCTURED IMPROVE THE NAV SYSTEM BY USING GOOGLE MAPS
DEFAULT FULL SCREEN MAP SWIPING EVERY TIME IS ANNOYING
THE SOUND QUALITY FOR THE XM RADIO IS EXTREMELEY LOW AND ALMOST SOUNDS MONO THE FM AND HD RADIO IS BETTER BUT THE HD SIGNAL COMES IN SO INFREQUENTLY THAT IT DOESN T COME IN ALL THAT WELL EITHER
SINCE WE HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I DID NOT WANT TO RATE IT HOWEVER BEFORE I COULD CONTINUE WITH THE SURVEY I WAS FORCED TO RATE THE SYSTEM
HARD TO USE TOUCH SCREEN WHEN DRIVING HARD TO PRE SELECT SATILLITE RADIO STATIONS YOU WANT TO JUST PUSH BUTTON FOR
FAILS TO SEND MESSAGES AS DESCRIBED EARLIER IN SURVEY VERY HARD TO SWITCH BETWEEN RADIO AND BLUETOOTH EVEN THOUGH I VE DONE IT A BUNCH OF TIMES NEVER CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH SCREEN TO GO TO SHOULD BE ON HOME SCREEN TO CHANGE SOURCE RATHER THAN HAV
I WOULD RATHER HAVE REAR ENTERTAINMENT LOCATED IN REAR HEADRESTS NAVIGATION IS NOT AT ALL USER FRIENDLY I CANNOT EVEN GET TO THE POINT WHERE THE ADDRESS CAN BE INPUT VERY IRRITATING
OCCASIONALLY TRAFFIC ROUTING STOPS WORKING EVEN THOUGH TOYOTA ENTUNE APP IS CONNECTED AND RUNNING NOT SURE WHAT CAUSES IT AS WE ARE STREAMING PANDORA AND WON T RECEIVE UPDATES TO TRAFFIC
IN GENERAL THE CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE AND NOT INTUITIVE FOR EXAMPLE TURNING DOWN THE VOLUME OF THE NAVIGATION GUIDANCE IS A CHORE ALSO THE PHONE OVERRIDES THE GUIDANCE SYSTEM LEADING TO MISSED TURNS
MAP
IT WILL BE BETTER TO HAVE THE SOUND SEPARATELY SUCH AS FROM THE MOVIE SOUND TO THE REAR SIDE AND THE RADIO OR CD TO THE FRONT SIDE
THE ON OFF VOLUME KNOB IS TOO SMALL IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING EVEN WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN SENSITIVIY ALL THE WAY DOWN YOU INEVITABLY CHANGE THE STATION OR SHUT THE RADIO OFF WHILE TRYING TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT BOTH CONTROLS SH
AUTOMATIC PHONE CONNECTIVITY WHEN ENTERING VEHICLE EVERY TIME
WISH I HAD A MULTI DISC CD PLAYER
WHEN THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE IN THE CAR COULD BE LINKED LIKE AIRBAG SWITCH IS USING WEIGHT IN THE RIGHT SEAT TO ALLOW CONTROL YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ALLOW CONTROL OF ALL OF THE CONTROLS OF THE NAVIGATION AND OTHER APPS INN THE SYSTEM
SOUND SYSTEM IS GOOD BUT SPEAKER COVERS RATTLE AT HIGH VOLUME DUE TO THE PLASTIC COVERS MIGHT ADD NEW SPEAKERS  SUBWOOFER INTO TRUCK BUT OVER ALL IT SOUNDS GREAT
BLUETOOTH LOSES CALLS AND FAILS TO CONNECT TO THE PHONE FREQUENTLY
THERE ISN T A GOOD SPOT TO HOLD MOUNT A SMARTPHONE
THE MICROPHONE IS NOT VERY SENSITIVE DURING A CALL THE RECIPIENT HEARS A LOT OF BACKGROUND NOISE AND THE CALLER SOUNDS DISTANT
WOULD BE NICE IF PASSENGER COULD ADJUST ADDRESS ON NAVIGATION WHILE CAR IS BEING DRIVEN
WE TEND TO USE GOOGLE MAPS ON OUR PHONE JUST BECAUSE IT IS SO EASY TO SET UP AND GO IT GETS A LITTLE PAINFUL WITH THE CURRENT ENTUNE SOFTWARE
WHEN I QUIT A DESTINATION BEFORE I ARRIVE THE SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW ME TO CHOOSE ANOTHER LOCATION BY STREET AND ADDRESS UNTIL THE TRUCK IS RESTARTED AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I CAN FIGURE OUT UP TO NOW
I DON T USE THE BUILT IN PHONE FEATURE AND I HAVEN T LEARNED TO USE THE TRAFFIC APP YET BUT IT HAS BEEN USELESS SO FAR BECAUSE I HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO MANIPULATE THE MAP YET AND CAN T GET A DETAILED LOCAL MAP AND I CAN T GET IT TO SHOW TRAFFI
THE SOUND QUALITY & SPEAKERS ARE BELOW AVERAGE YOU CAN TELL THAT THIS AREA WAS NOT A FOCUS POINT OF THIS TRUCK WITH THE VOLUME AT NORMAL OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL THE SOUND QUALITY IS POOR & THERE IS A LOT OF DOOR PANEL VIBRATION & RATTLING
MORE TECH FRIENDLY TO NON TECH PEOPLE
HOME SCREEN FOR NAV SYSTEM SHOULD BE WHERE IT CAN BE FULL SCREEN ALL THE TIME
THE SOUND QUALITY IS DEFINATELY LESS WHEN LISTENING TO SATALLITE RADIO VERSES THROUGH MY PHONE WITH SPOTIFY OR SLACKER I ALSO WITH IT AUTOMATICALLY ADJUSTED VOLUME WITH ROAD AND WIND NOISE LIKE ME OTHER CARS DO
THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T WORK WELL AND THE NAVIGATION IS ON A CARD DOESN T UPDATE ITSELF
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE NAVIGATION AND MORE OPTIONS FOR APPS INCLUDED IN EVERY MODEL
ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE THAT YOU CAN T DO A SOFTWARE UPDATE TO ADD FEATURES YOU SPEND $40K ON A VEHICLE ONLY TO FIND OUT NO NAVIGATION NO EXTERNAL APPS ETC NO WAY TO UPDATE THEM AT ALL IT REQUIRES A COMPLETE HARDWARE REPLACEMENT RIDICULOUS
SOUND SYSTEM NEEDS BETTER SPEAKERS VOICE RECOGNITION IS LIKE ALL THE REST WEAK
THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR AUDIO IS NOT USER FRIENDLY AND CONFUSING
NEED TO SIMPLIFY THE STEPS NEEDED FOR NAVIGATION NEED TO ALLOW A NEW DESTINATION TO BE ENTERED WHILE MOVING
SOUND QUALITY OF STEREO CAN BE IMPROVED FOR WHAT YOU PAY FOR A MID LEVEL TRUCK SOUND QUALITY SHOULD BE BETTER
OPTION OF UPGRADING TO A NAME BRAND AUDIO SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE MORE ACCURATE ALLOW MANY MULTIPLE FAVORITES GET ADVICE FROM GARMIN THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS EXCESSIVELY COMPLICATED GET ADVICE FROM APPLE THE BLUETOOTH PAIRING SYSTEM SHOULD BE SIMPLE
VISIBILITY OF THE PANEL WHEN IT IS SUNNY IS VERY POOR
POOR SOUND QUALITY LOW QUALITY SPEAKERS NOT ENOUGH POWER FOR VEHICLE THIS NOISY
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DEFAULT CONNECT TO PHONE ONLY NOT AUDIO FROM CELL WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH SO MANY STEPS WOULD LIKE THE AUDIO TEXT MESSAGING FEATURE TO WORK ALL THE TIME FOR THE IPHONE
LOVE THE RADIO LESS THAN THRILLED ABOUT THE XM WEATHER AND NAVIGATION THAT I DO NOT GET IN MY AREA NEEDS BUILT IN COMPASS AND TEMP INSTEAD OF RELYING ON SOMETHING THAT MOST AREAS CANT GET
HIGHER QUALITY BASE SOUND SYSTEM FREE SATELLITE RADIO
MY ONLY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE SYSTEMS ARE THAT THE MANUAL VOLUME CONTROL IS TOO SMALL AND A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO USE THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS MAKE UP FOR IT THOUGH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE CALIBRATED BUT I CAN T FIND A WAY TO DO SO
I WISH I HAD THE ABILITY TO OPERATE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM USING THE MANUAL CONTROLS WHILE I AM DRIVING
INAPP SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LOOKS A DECADE OLD FROM DESIGN LOOK AND FEEL AND GRAPHICS WAY TOO MANY STEPS TO ENTER ANYTHING PLUS CONFIRM MUSIC SELECTION IS JUST EASIER FROM PHONE THAN TRYING TO USE CAR ALSO TEXT MESSAGE DINGS
VOICE COMMANDS ARE TOO NUMEROUS TO EVEN BEGIN TO REMEMBER THEM I COULD LOOK THEM UP BUT I AM DRIVING IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN GET TO THE COMMAND YOU WANT AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS BARELY FUNCTIONAL IT NEVER RECOGNIZES A NAME I HAVE I
NAVIGATION SYSTEM MAP DISPLAY IS VERY CONFUSING THERE ARE THREE CHOICES AS TO HOW TO MAKE IT LOOK WHICH ARE CONFUSING AND NONE OF THEM GIVES ME THE LOOK I WANT WHICH LOOK BY THE WAY MY JAGUAR XF HAD
CHANGING STATIONS AND CHANGING FROM AM TO FM TO SIRIUS IS OVERLY COMPLICATED
THE EXITS ARE IDENTIFIED BY NUMBERS ONLY THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE THE NAME OF EACH EXIT TOO
EQUALIZER ADJUSTMENTS FOR MUSIC BEYOND THE NORMAL BASS AND TREBLE PERHAPS PRE SET CATGEGORIES SUCH AS ROCK JAZZ CLASSICAL ETC
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE A LIST OF TURNS FOR THE ENTIRE ROUTE WHEN USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT MAY BE POSSIBLE BUT I HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THIS I NEED TO CHECK THE MANUAL TO SEE IF IT IS POSSIBLE
EASIER VOICE COMMANDS
TOUCH SCREEN SPEED OF RESPONSE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS UPDATING TOUCH CONTROLS LAG IN RESPONSE TIME AND MAPS ARE INACCURATE AND SLOW NEEDS GOOGLE MAPS
TOO MANY COMMANDS REQUIRED TO MAKE A PHONE CALL
AUDIO COMMUNICATION NAVIGATION SCREENS COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
REDO THE SOFTWARE THAT CONTROLS AUDIO INPUT VIA EXTERNAL PLAYER IPOD ONCE YOU HAVE COMMANDED MUSIC SEARCH IPOD FROM THAT POINT FORWARD THE ONLY COMMAND SHOULD BE PLAY OR LIST  IF YOU WANT TO SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT SOURCE FOR M
TOUCH SCREEN IS COMPLETELY CONFUSING
I REALLY LIKE THE 8 DISPLAY AND THE TOUCH SCREEN IS VERY RESPONSIVE THE DISPLAY NAVIGATION IS EASY TO USE
LARGER NAVI SCREEN
OPERATOR ERROR EASE OF LEARNING HOW TO USE ALL THE APPS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS USELESS I USE MY ANDROID PHONE AND GOOGLE MAPS INSTEAD THE BLUETOOTH IS TERRIBLE I REPLACED THAT FUNCTIONALITY WITH E $30 PRODUCT FOUND ON AMAZON THAT RUNS RINGS AROUND THE FACTORY INSTALLED THE FACT THAT THE NAV AUDIO
RADIO CUTS OUT EVEN WITH PRESETS SAME STATION PLAYS WHEN CHANGING BANDS
HD STATIONS DOUBLE TALK OVER EACH OTHER CREATING AN ECHO EFFECT SEEMS SOME STATIONS HAVE MULTIPLE HD SITE I AM UNABLE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER TO JUST LISTEN TO ONE HARD TO ACCESS APPLICAITONS NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO CONNECT ONCE FINALLY CONNECTED
THERE ARE MULTIPLE AND THEY RE ALL IMPORTANT TO ME SO I CAN T SIMPLY NAME ONE 1 STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS DON T WORK WITH IPOD AS THEY DID WITH MY PREVIOUS MURANO UP DOWN ON THE STEERING WHEEL ONLY GOES TO THE NEXT PREVIOUS TRACK AND DOE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM I LIKE MY HAND HELD GARMEN NUVI 2450 BETTER MAYBE I AM JUST MORE USED TO IT BUT I THINK THE GRAPHICS ARE BETTER THEY BOTH TAKE ME TO THE WRONG LOCATION SOMETIMES
DON T LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN FOR CHANNEL CHANGING WHILE DRIVING NOT SAFE AND NOT AS EASY AS BUTTONS OR JUST TURNING THE DIAL LIKE MY JUKE
NAVIGATION IS FREQUENTLY INCORRECT I HAVE ALREADY LEARNED NOT TO TRUST IT IN 4 MONTHS WE ALWAYS DOUBLE CHECK ROUTES WITH OUR PHONES
AUTO COMMUNICATION NOT ANY BETTER THAN MY FORD ESCAPE NAVIGATION SYSTEM POOR FOR TRIPS GARMIN MUCH BETTER PRODUCT
NAV TALKS TOO MUCH GIVES TOO MUCH INFO AT ONCE AND WAY TO EARLY
CONTROL IS DIFFICULT TO REACH WHEN DRIVING NOT GREAT SOUND NEEDS MUCH BETTER AND INTUITIVE VOICE RECOGNITION NAVIGATION NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND ENTIRE ADDRESS IN SINGLE VOICE PROMPT
UPDATE NAVIGATION TO LOOK AS GOOD AS GOOGLE MAPS ON IPHONE DISPLAY NAVIGATION ON WINDSHIELD THE XM RADIO HAS TO BE CHANGED BY USING KNOB ON PASSEGER SIDE OF DASH MAKING IT CUMBERSOME AND DANGEROUS TO SURF XM STATIONS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM LACKS THE EASE OF USE OF A STAND ALONE GARMIN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
XM CHANNEL SELECTION COULD BE IMPROVED
I TRULY HATE THE CD PLAYER IN THIS NEW CAR
AGAIN PLACEMENT OF SYSTEM IS HARD TO REACH ALSO DO NOT CARE FOR THE BOSE SPEAKERS SOUND VERY TINNY RELATIVE TO OTHER SYSTEMS I HAVE HAD BMW IS MUCH BETTER MUCH BETTER
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN CALLING CONTACTS DOESN T WORK 95 PERCENT OF TIME
IT IS DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO HEAR ME WHEN USING THE VEHICLE S HANDS FREE PHONE
SIMPLIFY THE IPOD INTERFACE
PLEASE ADD A COMPASS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IT IS GREATLY MISSED MY OTHER CARS ALL HAVE IT ALL MY OTHER INFINITI S HAD IT
INTEGRATION WITH APPLE CARPLAY DO AWAY WITH BUILT IN NAVIGATION AND USE CARPLAY INSTEAD SO WE CAN JUST DRIVE EVERYTHING FROM THE PHONE CHARGING FOR MAP UPDATES IS A COMPLETE RIP OFF
GETTING THE IPHONE TO PLAY MUSIC
USING THE TOUCH SCREEN DISTRACTS FROM DRIVING
MAP COLORS NAVIGATION CURSOR COLOR
I OPTED FOR NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND I WISH I HAD
POINTS OF INTEREST ARE INCOMPLETE OUT OF DATE USE CONNECTIVITY TO ACCESS GOOGLE AND THEIR POI S ALSO THE SPORT CHORONO LAP TIMER IS A ABSOLUTE WASTE OF 2800 THE APP BARELY WORKS IT DOESN T LINK TO THE CAR S PCM SYSTEM AND YOU CANNOT EXPOR
AH HA APPS ARE NOT VERY USEFUL OR INTUITIVE WOULD BE BETTER WITH APPLE PLAY OR SIMILAR SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT NEEDS TO BE CAN BE FRUSTRATING WHEN IT MISINTERPRETS WORDS
NOT CHARGING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS TO UPDATE MAP INFORMATION FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MANY CARS HAVE NAV SYSTEMS THAT UPDATE AUTOMATICALLY VIA INTERNET NO EXCUSE AT PORSCHE S PRICES NOT TO HAVE THAT FEATURE
NO ACCESS TO VEHICLE SETTINGS FROM FRONT SCREEN PANEL UNABLE TO ANSWER PHONE USING PERSONAL DRIVER DISPLAY MUST PRESS BUTTON ON STEERING WHEEL
VOICE CONTROL OPTION IS NEEDED
BLUETOOTH SOMETIMES DROP CONNECTION
IMPROVE COLOR OF MAP DISPLAY THE MAP DISPLAY CLARITY CENTERING ON VEHICLE IS INFERIOR TO SYSTEM IN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE THAT THIS REPLACED AN AUDI Q5
WISH THAT ONE COULD GO FROM SATELLITE 1 TO SATELLITE 2 AND 3 WITHOUT HAVING TO USE THE TOUCHSCREEN ON THE DISPLAYS OFTEN HAVE TO PRESS 2 OR 3 TIMES BEFORE IT ACTUALLY CHANGES AND THIS IS NOT EASY TO DO WHEN DRIVING SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING ON THE
PHONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTS WUICKLY
THE SCREEN DOES NOT LIST WHAT IS PLAYING ON OTHER SATELLITE STATIONS AS THE BMW SYSTEM DOES
GRAPHICS AREN T AS GOOD AS YOUR COMPETITION HANDS FREE CONTROL IS A NIGHTMARE LIKE YOUR COMPETITION MAYBE ANOTHER GENERATION BEFORE IT WORKS SEAMLESSLY
WHEN CONNECTING TO AN AUX IPOD PHONE THE VOLUME IS NOT CONSISTENT GO TO FULL LOAD
INCLUDE HD RADIO
THE 911 GT3 IS A DRIVING CAR AND AUDIO SYSTEM WAS NOT WHY I BOUGHT THE CAR
MY LAST VEHICLE WAS A LEXUS AND WHEN I WAS USING HANDS FREE CALLING THE PERSON THAT I WAS TALKING TO WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TELL THAT I WAS IN THE CAR IT IS VERY OBVIOUS TO ANYONE THAT I AM TALKING TO IN MY INFINITY THAT I AM IN THE CAR
NAVIGATION IS NOT THE BEST
WOULD LIKE A USB PORT AND AN ELECTRIC PLUG IN INSTEAD OF A CIGARETTE LIGHTER STYLE POWER PORT
COMPLICATED AND NAVIGATION THROUGH ITS VARIOUS SYSTEMS IS AWKWARD AT BEST
DO NOT USE BOSE AS THE FIRST UPGRADE HARMON KARDON OR OTHER WOULD BE BETTER
HARD TO NAVIGATE IN THE SYSTEM TOO MANY FEATURES
NEED TO USE USB CABLE TO CONNECT IPAD IPHONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY FOR IPHONE IPAD IS STANDARD ON MOST COMPETITOR VEHICLES
SOUND QUALITY STEREO SEPARATION OPEN EXPANSIVENESS OF THE SOUND FIELD COULD BE IMPROVED SPEAKERS COULD USE IMPROVEMENT BUT MORE SOPHISTICATED SOUND PROCESSING WOULD HELP TOO
I COULD HAVE UPGRADED TO A BETTER SOUND SYSTEM BUT THOUGHT THE AUDIO QUALITY WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER WITHOUT HAVING TO SPRING FOR A BOSE SYSTEM THE CLARITY IN THE SOUND IS MISSING AND THE BALANCE SEEMS OFF NOT SURE HOW THE SPEAKERS ARE S
MOVING BETWEEN RADIO STATIONS REQUIRES A LOT OF TOUCHES
THE BASE AUDIO SYSTEM
DO NOT APPEAR TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE PROGRAMED RADIO STATIONS USING STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
BETTER ESSENTIALLY CONTINUOUS UPDATING CAPABILITY FOR MAP AND POI CURRENCY ACCURACY ANNUAL OR SEMI ANNUAL UPDATES ARE UNREASONABLY EXPENSIVE GIVEN THAT MOST SMARTPHONE EQUIVALENTS PROVIDE THIS CONTINUOUSLY AND AT NO COST
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS PRETTY BAD IMPROVED SINCE 997 BUT NOT AS GOOD AS IPHONE
NAVIGATION CLARITY NOT AS GOOD AS BMW SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEND TEXT MESSAGES VOICE RECOGNITION FOR CALLING PHONE BOOK COULD BE IMPROVED
HARD TO GET PANDORA TO WORK SOMETIMES
POI
NAVIGATION IS EASY TO USE
VOICE CONTROL SHOULD BE STANDARD OPTION
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ITSELF IS JUNK YOU PUNCH IN STREET NUMBER AND NAME INFO AND IT AUTOMATICALLY BLANKS OUT LETTERS NUMBERS THAT CANNOT BE USED SOME ADDRESSES AREN T LISTED IN THE SYSTEM SO IT STARTS NARROWING LETTERS AND NUMBERS DOWN LEAVING
PORSCHE AND APPLE SHOULD BECOME FRIENDS
SCREEN COULD BE LARGER AND IT S MISSING LOT OF ADDRESSES OR SO IT SEEMS DIFFICULT TO ENTER ADDRESSES
MULTI CD PLAYER 6 WOULD HAVE BEEN NICER
BRIEF TRAINING OF GADGETS AT SALE TIME
CONNECTIVITY WITH BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE CALLS MULTIPLE CD PLAYER WOUL BE BETTER NEED TO PROVIDE MORE USB PORTS FOR ACCESS
WISH COULD STREAM WAZE VIA BLUETOOTH
THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS AWESOME THE NAVIGATION IS DIFFICULT TO USE I VE HAD TO USE THE NAVIGATION ON MY IPHONE BECAUSE THE PORSCHE NAV IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND MAKES MISTAKES
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS AN UPGRADE TAKES YOU THE LONG ROUTE MORE COMPLICATED THAN NECESSARY & ROUTES ARE NOT THE BEST AVAILABLE
THE CAR IS TO NOISEY FOR EFFECTIVE SPEAKER PHONE OPERATION IF I TAKE A CALL I HAVE TO STOP OR SLOW DOWN TO 30 MPH
I HAD AN AUDI A7 FROM THE NAV   AUDIO SYSTEMS IN THAT CARE WERE FAR SUPERIOR TO THE PORSCHE
DOES NOT HAVE NAVIGATION WOULD BE GREAT IF IT DID
MORE SEEMLESS WITH IPHONE   CELLPHONE IE CONTROL PANDORA FROM SYSTEM NOT CELL ETC E G LIKE MY TELSA WHICH IS BY FAR SUPERIOR IN INTEGRATION OF DEVICES ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE CLEANER INTERFACES PORSCHE IS MORE OLD SCHOOL I M OK WITH IT BUT I
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TERRIBLE THE DISPLAY BOARD ALSO LOOKS UNSOPHISTICATED AN EQUALIZER FEATURE WITH MULTIPLE BARS WOULD LOOK COOL
THE VOICE RECOGNITION NEVER UNDERSTANDS ME SO I STOPPED USING IT I FIND THE RINGING SOUND DISTRACTING AND ANNOYING MY CHILDREN DO TOO
USE GOOGLE MAPS
MORE INSTRUCTION GUIDANCE FROM DEALERSHIP FOR US LESS TECH SAVVY
VOICE RECOGNITION IS A CHALLENGE FOR ME
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PHONE EASIER TO USE TRAFFIC INFORMATION
DOES NOT UNDERSTAND ADDRESSES
THERE IS NO USB CONNECTIVITY FOR ANDROID BASED PHONES NOT EVERYONE HAS AN APPLE BASED PHONE THE INTEGRATED HARD DRIVE SYSTEM CAN ONLY BE LOADED FROM AUDIO CD S IT WOULD BE NICE IF MUSIC COULD BE TRANSFERRED FROM PHONE OR USB DRIVE
NAV VOICE CONTROL CAN BE CONFUSING NOT TOO INTUITIVE
BETTER AND MORE VOICE COMMANDS
SOME NAVIGATION CONTROLS NOT INTUITIVE OVERALL MUSIC SOUND IS AVERAGE FOR A TECH PACKAGED LUXURY CAR
CANNOT GET USED TO WHERE TO LOOK FOR CERTAIN THINGS CLOCK TEMP RADIO STATION ETC
NAVIGATION SYSTEM RESPONSE IS NOT VERY FAST
I LOVE EVERYTHING ASPECT OF THE TECH PACKAGE I HAVE IN MY RDX BUT THE USE OF ENTERING A DESTINATION AND IT S INACCURACY PLUS THE AWKWARD INACCURACY OF THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS WHAT PULLS DOWN MY RATING
SETTING A DESTINATION
HANDS FREE SOUND AND VOLUME IS NOT GOOD MICROPHONE DOES NOT WORK WELL FOR HANDS FREE CALLING
THE NAV SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE WITH VOICE ENTRY THE PHONE SYSTEM IS EASY TO USE AND PROVIDES BOTH MESSAGING & CALLS BUT ALL ARE USED MANUALLY INSTEAD OF VOICE THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS USED MANUALLY BECAUSE THE VOICE SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE THE
BIGGER SCREEN IN THE CENTER CONSOLE MORE ACCURATE SOUND WHEN USING HANDS FREE MODE FOR PHONE CALLS
ABILITY TO SHOW MAP OR NAVIGATION FROM PHONE INTO CAR S SCREEN VERSUS JUST THE AUXILIARY VOCAL
I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE NAV WHILE DRIVING BUT I BELIEVE THAT S DUE TO A LAW
VOICE COMMANDS ARE TOO HARD TO USE
SPEED AND SOUNDS OF CONNECTIVITY
STEERING WHEEL CONTROL ARE VERY LIMITED IN FUNCTIONALITY CANNOT USE THESE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH MENUS SETTING ADDRESS IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TEDIOUS OVERALL INTEGRATION OF AUDIO SYSTEM NAVIGATION AND VEHICLE INFO IS NOT GOOD MAY BE I FELT THIS
VOICE COMMANDS NEED TO BE MEMORIZED TO GET A RESPONSE HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO DO SO SO RATING ARE LOWER THAN THEY WOULD BE IF THINGS WERE EASIER TO USE THE ONE THING I WOULD LIKE IMPROVED WOULD BE THE SMALL STREET NAVIGATION WHEN USING MAPS RATH
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE WITH IT IS I AM FROM THE HORSE & BUGGY DAYS & THE TECHNOLOGY IS A LOT TO GET USED TO BUT I AM GETTING THERE I AM RETIRED AND ONLY DRIVE ABOUT 7500 MILES PER YEAR NOW I READ THE MANUAL BUT JUST NEED TO SIT IN THE DRIV
A MULTI CD INSTEAD OF ONLY ONE I HAD A SIX CD ON MY ACURATSX
THE CD SHOULD BEGIN WHERE IT LEFT OFF AND NOT BEGIN THE TRACT AGAIN AND THEY NEED TO INSTALL A 6 CD PLAYER OR AT THE VERY LEAST MAKE IT AN OPTION FOR THOSE OF US THAT WANT IT
WHILE DRIVING IT DOES NOT ALLOW SETTING NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE SETTING THE DESTINATION AGREED ITS SAFETY FEATURE BUT IF THE PASSENGER WANTS TO SET IT WHAT PROBLEM IS THERE LAST TIME WE WERE LATE AND STARTED DRIVING WITHOUT SETTING THE D
THE VOICE RECOGNITION S PERFORMANCE IS SPORADIC I HAVE A HARD TIME CHANGING SATELLITE RADIO STATIONS AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO JUST ENTER A NUMERIC NUMBER RATHER THAN USE THE ARROW KEYS I WILL HAVE TO CHECK MY MANUAL
SEE PREVIOUS COMMENETS ON NAV SYSTEM
WHEN I ADJUST THE SOUND ON THE STEERING WHEEL OFTEN THE RADIO STATION HAS TO BE RE ADJUSTED BECAUSE IT WILL RE SET
THE MAP ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CLEARLY LOW DEFINITION IT COULD BE IMPROVED
NAVI SYSTEM WORKS WELL BUT WE DROVE THE CAR FROM CHICAGO TO MIAMI AND BACK AND FOUND THE TRAFFIC REPORTING WAS USELESS AND WE DIDN T EVEN TRY TO USE IT AFTER THE FIRST 3 DAYS ON THE ROAD THE WEATHER REPORTING WASN T THAT GREAT EITHER A FEW TIMES
ONLY ISSUE IN USING VOICE CONTROL IS THE DEFAQULT SETTING OF HAVING TO PRESS THE TALK BUTTON TWICE TO TELL WHAT YOU WANT
ALLOW DOWNLOAD TO INTERNAL HARD DRIVE VIA SUB PORT AND NOT JUST FROM CD S
A FRONT SEATED PASSENGER CANNOT CONTROL THE NAV UNIT WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION THAT S UNACCEPTABLE TO ME
IF ONLY THE VOICE CONTROLS WOULD WORK I WOULD GIVE IT A 10 10
SOUND QUALITY OF SPEAKERS AND IMPROVE GRAPHICS FOR RADIO CONTROLS
ACCURACY OF GPS SYSTEM IT DISPLAYS LOCAL STREET NAMES INSTEAD OF HIGHWAY NUMBERS WHEN TRAVELING OUT OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD IT IS HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO TURN ON S FOURTH ST WHEN IT IS REALLY US36 NEED OPTION TO DISPLAY HIGHWAY NUMBERS VOICE SYS
TAKE THE CONNECTIONS FOR THE IPOD ETC OUT OF THE CENTER CONSOLE MAKE THEM MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE USERS PUT THEM ON THE OUTSIDE WHERE THEY CAN BE EASILY ACCESSED REGARDING THE NAV ITS DISPLAY OF MAPS NEEDS IMPROVEMENT LOOK AT THE SYSTEM USED
VOICE RECOGNITION IS AVERAGE NAVIGATION AND INTERNET HARD TO NAVIGATE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT EASY TO USE TO FIND A LOCATION THE CONTROLS ARE CUMBERSOME
THE CLUMSY NOT INTUITIVE LAYERING OF THE SYSTEM THE USE OF STILTED LANGUAGE TO CALL UP FRREQUENTLY USED FUNCTIONS LIKE CALL BARB USE OF IPHONE ADDRESS BOOK FOR NAVIGATION CALLING UP STORED LOCATIONS CHANGING THE CITY AS A DEFAULT SWITCHING
I HAVEN T HAD MUCH SUCCESS WITH VOICE RECOGNITION TO CHANGE FROM SATELLITE TO FM RADIO I MOSTLY USE THE THUMB WHEEL TO MAKE THE CHANGES
I NEED TO EXPLORE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE ONE TIME I TRIED TO ENGAGE IT I COULD NOT TURN IT OFF COULDN T MANAGE WHILE ACTIVELY DRIVING PROBABLY NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP FOR MORE TRAINING
VOICE RECOGNITION UNDERPERFORMS AND COULD BE IMPROVED
BLUETOOTH VOLUME IS REALLY BAD SOMETIMES I CANNOT HEAR THE PERSON ON THE PHONE AND MY VOLUME IS MAX ALSO I NEVER GOT THE PHONE APP TO WORK
SWITCHING FROM AM TO FM RADIO
VOICE RECOGNITION GOOD BUT NOT GREAT
I LIKE THE BUILT IN APPLICATIONS AND THE 3G WIRELESS ASPECT OF THE CAR ALSO THE HARMON KARDON SOUND SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING
I HAVE ISSUES CONNECTING MY IPHONE THROUGH THE USB PORT THE AUDIO SYSTEM DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE DEVICE EVEN WHEN ON USB MODE I HAVE NOT ISSUES STREAMING MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO RATE THE NAVIGATION SINCE I HAVEN T USED IT I ALWAYS USE MY IPHONE FOR NAVIGATION
IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SIRIUS RADIO BY VOICE RATHER THAN THROUGH THE CAR SYSTEM
GETTING INTO NAVIGATION VERBALLY COULD BE MADE A BIT EASIER
PUTTING DESTINATIONS INTO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CLUNKY I HAVEN T TRIED USING THE VOICE ACTIVATION SYSTEM SINCE THE INITIAL DEMONSTRATION AT THE DEALER IT SEEMED COMPLICATED I WILL PROBABLY FORCE MYSELF TO LEARN IT IN FUTURE IT S MUCH EAS
SOUND RECOGNITION FEATURES COULD BE MORE ACCURATE
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION LESS CONFUSING MENUS EASIER INPUT TO NAVIGATION SYSTEM
ACCURACY AND ROUTING OF NAVIGATION ROUTES
AS I SAID IN THE PROBLEMS SECTION IT IS THE POOR DESIGN OF HOW MULTIPLE PERSONAL DESTINATIONS OR POI S ARE IMPORTED AND ESPECIALLY ACCESSED IF I HAVE A SAVED DESTINATION THAT IS 600 MILES AWAY IT SHOULD BE EASY TO ACCESS AND CURRENTLY I
APPLICATIONS LIKE PANDORA LOAD EXTREMELY SLOW 4 TO 6 TIMES AS SLOW AS MY PHONE NAVIGATION IS INACCURATE AND CUMBERSOME TO USE COMPARED TO GARMIN NAVIGATION
MAKE THE INTERFACE FASTER AND LESS FUSSY ALSO IMPROVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SO IT UNDERSTANDS MY COMMANDS
ADD SUBWOOFER TO THE UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM
PHONE SYSTEM SET UP FOR SPEED DIALS COULD BE SIMPLER
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED AN UPGRADED AUDIO SYSTEM
THE SENSUS INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM HAS GREAT POTENTIAL BUT RIGHT NOW THE CURRENT VERSION IS A BIT CLUNKY TO USE MAINLY THE INABILITY TO KEEP A CONTINUOUS INTERNET SIGNAL WHEN USING THE SENSUS APPS
SENIORS NEED AN EASIER WAY TO USE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUSINESS HAS HELPED ME BUT I NEED MORE HELP
VOICE ACTIVATION NEEDS IMPROVING OR A BETTER EXPLANATION ON HOW TO USE IT THE BOOK INSTRUCTIONS ARE POOR I THINK I NEED A HANDS ON LESSON
WAY TOO MANY OPTIONS TO USE HAVE TO STUDY MANUAL TO FIGURE HOW TO USE WHAT I REALLY NEED NOT INTUITIVE EASY TO USE GOOGLE MAPS BEFORE I START ON A TRIP DO NOT WANT TO LEARN PHONE APPS AND CAR APPS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT PHONE TO CAR AND HA
CANNOT BELIEVE THAT VOLVO STILL HAS NOT MADE USING AN IPHONE SIMPLE THE TELEPHONE CONNECTION DOES NOT ALLOW THE DIALING OF AN EXTENSION AFTER THE MAIN NUMBER IS DIALED IT MUST BE HAND DIALED EVEN IF THE EXTENSION IS IN THE CONTACTS OF THE IPHONE
AS I STATED ABOVE AT A TOTAL COST OF $44 000 WE EXPECTED THE CAR TO HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM THREE OF US HEARD THE SALESMAN TELL US IT HAD ONE THE LACK OF A NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON AN EXPENSIVE CAR LIKE THIS VOLVO IS INEXCUSABLE
KNOBS SEEM CHEEP VOICE ACTIVATION FOR CALLS DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK PROPERLY
LOVE THE ENTIRE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SPEAKER SYSTEM I PURCHASED THE UPGRADE AND ITS AVERAGE AT BEST
BUTTONS TOO SMALL ENTERING LOCATIONS INTO NAV TERRIBLE
THE VOICE NAVIGATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CLUMSY AND DIFFICULT AT TIMES IT WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE A STREET NAME WHICH WAS FRUSTRATING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ON MY VOLVO WAS BETTER THAN THE ONE ON MY MODEL
SWITCHING ALBUMS WHEN CONNECTED TO SMARTPHONE
PROBABLY IT IS USER UNFAMILIARITY BUT I DON T REALLY KNOW HOW TO USE THE AUDIO FUNCTION TO DO ANYTHING BUT ACCESS THE PHONE AND MAKE CALLS HANDS FREE THE INTERNET CONNECTION WITH THE CAR RARELY WORKS OR WE ARE DOING IT WRONG WE HAVE MULTIPLE DE
I WISH THE NAVIGATION WAS PUSH BUTTON INSTEAD OF DIAL
3G WIRELESS CONNECTION IS SLOW SHOULD HAVE UTILIZED 4G LTE
I AM MOST FRUSTRATED WITH THE BUILT IN INTERNET POOR CONNECTIVITY AND FREQUENTLY DISCONNECTED
NAVIGATION VERY HARD TO USE
I AM NOT A FAN OF THE MOUSE ON THE CONSOLE I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING I LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN ON MY PREVIOUS LS BETTER
THE TOUCH SCREEN WORKING ALL OF THE TIME
AGAIN IT S ALL ABOUT THE TOUCH PAD AND GETTING AROUND BETWEEN ALL THE MENU CHOICES WAY TOO COMPLICATED LOVE THE CAR HATE THE TOUCH PAD
HANDS FREE IS NICE
PHONE PAIRING IS PROBLEMATIC AT TIMES AND THE SOUND QUALITY FROM XM COULD BE BETTER
VOICE RECOGNITION HAS TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING VOICE COMMANDS
NAVIGATION IS HARD TO HEAR WHEN LISTENING TO MUSIC MUSIC LEVELS DO NOT DECREASE WHEN NAVIGATION IS SPEAKING
I HAVE NO EQUALIZER SO MAYBE IF I DID THE SOUND QUALITY WOULD BE BETTER
BLUETOOTH LIMITED NOT EASILY NAVIGATED WHILE DRIVING COULD BE MORE AUTOMATIC MEMORIZE SETTINGS RADIO NOT VERY GOOD BASS
SATELLITE RADIO SEEMS TO HAVE REDUCED SOUND FIDELITY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT QUITE INTUITIVE FOR EXAMPLE I NEED TO ENTER SOUTH OAK ST HAD A VERY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THE SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE SOUTH
I DO NOT FIND THE VOICE COMMANDS TO BE USER FRIENDLY
ADD ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE THE DISPLAYS IN THE CAR SO THAT THE FEATURES THE DRIVER WANTS TO SE ARE VISIBLE AT ONE TIME
PEOPLE HAVE HARD TIME HEARING ME SOMETIMES ON THE PHONE HANDS FREE OPTION
SOUND QUALITY IS INFERIOR
WHEN I MAKE A CALL THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END GETS ALL OF THE ENGINE NOISE I HAVE BEEN TOLD IT IS UNBEARABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED WITH MULTIPLE PEOPLE AND I VE CALLED WITH MULTIPLE CELL PHONES
GUIDANCE USING THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS JUST NOT USER FRIENDLY FROM INPUT REQUIRED TO VOICE COMMANDS GOOGLE MAPS IF SO INCREDIBLY EASY BY CONTRAST
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION AND BETTER RECEPTION OF LOCAL FM STATIONS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CUMBERSOME TO USE I USE MY PHONE INSTEAD BUILT IN WIFI IS TOO SLOW HAS POOR COVERAGE TMOBILE
THE AUDI BANG AND OLUFSEN SYSTEM IS DISAPPOINTING LACK OF BASS EXTENSION AND DEFINITION MID RANGE PRESENCE IS THIN AND UNDEFINED ACCURATE TO A POINT BUT LIFELESS I AM A TRUE AUDIOPHILE AND THIS IS NOT AN AUDIOPHILE LEVEL SYSTEM BMW HARMO
POOR VOICE RECOGNITION EVEN AFTER TRAINING NAVIGATION STILL MUCH POORER RESOLUTION THAN A IPHONE
DISPLAY ALL AVAILABLE MUSIC WHEN IPHONE CONNECTED BY BLUETOOTH
SOUND QUALITY IS OK NOT GREAT
CONNECTIVITY IN GLOVE BOX DIFFICULT TO ACCESS
AUDIO DISPLAY USER INTERFACE IS NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED COMPARED WITH M B FOR EXAMPLE SIRIUS XM MENU COULD BE A LOT MORE REFINED
SOUND QUALITY OF BANG & OLUFSEN SOUND SYSTEM
THE VOLUME KNOB ON THE CONSOLE INCORPORATES A JOYSTICK TO CHANGE CHANNELS ON THE RADIO OR SATELLITE RADIO ETC THIS IS NOT GOOD WHEN A PASSENGER IS IN THE FRONT SEAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO CHANGE CHANNELS WITHOUT NUDGING THEM MY AUDIT S4 H
COULD VE BEEN 4G LTE FOUND ON A3 S3 A6 S6
SD CARDS ARE OUTDATED SHOULD HAVE BEEN USB PORTS IN A NEEDS BETTER CONNECTIVITY WITH IPHONE MEDIA
MISSING A LOT OF STANDARD AUDIO ENTERTAINMENT FEATURES FOUND IN LESS EXPENSIVE CARS LIKE BLUETOOTH AUDIO TOUCH SCREEN ASSISTED PARKING CAMERA ETC TOO MANY TO LIST A $50K CAR SHOULD HAVE ALL OR MOST OF THESE BY DEFAULT
LESS STEPS TO PROGRAM A DESTINATION
IPHONE CONVERSATION IS DIFFICULT FOR OTHER PARTY TO UNDERSTAND
NOT PANDORA COMPATIBLE PHONE AUDIO NOT VERY CLEAR
CONNECTIVITY IS ONLY 3G SHOULD BE 4G
EASE OF INPUTTING DESTINATION COULD BE IMPROVED GARMIN PROBABLY DOES IT BEST I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST USING TOUCH SCREEN TECHNOLOGY FEEL OF STEERING WHEEL AUDIO CONTROLS SEEM CHEAP FOR A LUXURY CAR IT SHOULD FEEL MORE HIGH END LASTLY 3G
WOULD PREFER A TOUCH SCREEN FUNCTION AS WELL
ENTERING DESTINATION ADDRESSES IS REALLY PAINFUL AND IF IT HAS MULTIPLE LOCATIONS E G FRED MEYER IT IS DIFFICULT FROM THE DISPLAY TO ENSURE I M SELECTING THE CORRECT LOCATION UNTIL IT S TOO LATE AND I HAVE TO START OVER
BLUETOOTH SOUND QUALITY
THE TIME IT TAKES FROM WHEN THE CAR IS STARTED UNTIL THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS READY TO ACCEPT A DESTINATION BY VOICE COMMAND COULD BE REDUCED
SOMETIMES VOICE RECOGNITION ISN T ACCURATE NEED TO REPEAT OR CANCEL SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE IT UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SAY WHILE STATING AN ADDRESS
PHONE CALLS COULD BE MORE CLEAR
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT DISPLAY STREET NAMES IN THE VICINITY SO HARD TO ANTICIPATE CHANGES AND ROUTES THAT ARE NOT ALREADY PROGRAMED INTO THE SYSTEM THE REST OF THE SYSTEM WORKS FINE BUT THIS IS A MAJOR FLAW THAT OVERSHADOWS ALL OTHER FEATURES
THE GRAPHICS LOOK OLD ORANGE WITH BLACK {{{ LOOKS LIKE AN OLD COMOPUTER SYSTEM WOULD LOVE TO HAVE CARPLAY BY APPLE
VOICE RECOGNITION EASE OF ENTERING ADDRESSES
LIKE THE ONE TOUCH FAVORITE RADIO STATION AND THE ABILITY TO HANDWRITE NUMBERS LETTERS FOR NAVIGATION
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CONFUSING I WISH IT WAS AS SIMPLE AS MY HAND HELD NAVIGATION DEVICE
AUTO NAVIGATION IS BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF STARTING SEARCHES BY CITY THEY SHOULD START BY STREET ADDRESS
VOCIE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NOT VERY GOOD
THE AUDIO INTERFACE IS VERY DATED NAVIGATION DATA ALSO SEEMS DATED I VE LIVED ON MY STREET FOR 3 YEARS AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM STILL DOES NOT HAVE THE CORRECT SPELLING OF THE STREET NOR DOES IT CONTAIN THE CORRECT HOUSE NUMBERS ON THE STREET
I DO NOT SEEM TO BE ABLE TO USE THE VOICE COMMANDS VERY WELL HARD TO PUT IN AN ADDRESS I THINK I NEED A LESSON AT THE DEALER
THE SPEAKERS COULD BE A BIT BETTER FOR MUSIC AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS VERY TEDIOUS FOR ENTERING DESTINATION INFO
NEED USB PORTS
THE IPOD INTERFACE IS NOT ABLE TO SHOW PLAYLISTS ARTISTS OR ALBUMS
MY LAST CAR HAD A TOUCH SCREEN THAT WAS MORE INTUITIVE TO USE I M GETTING USED TO THE MMI SYSTEM BUT IT S NOT EASY TO USE
HAVE MY IPHONE RELIABLY CONNECT TO THE CAR SYSTEM EVERY TIME I GET IN THE CAR
FOR A BANG AND OLUFSEN SOUND SYSTEM DID NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS
WISH IT WOULD PLAY A CD OR MULTIPLE CDS INSTEAD OF JUKEBOX
THE PROBLEM WITH THE CD PLAYER KEEPS ME FORM RATING THE ENTIRE SYSTEM HIGHER I ALSO THINK IT SHOULD HAVE A MULTIPLE CD CHANGER INSTEAD OF A SINGLE DISC
BIGGER NAVIGATION DISPLAY
CANNOT CONNECT IPHONE TO SUPPLIED CABLE AND USE WHILE BLUETOOTH AUDIO IS CONNECTED HAVE TO DISABLE BLUETOOTH AUDIO WHEN CONNECTING PHONE VIA CABLE WHEN USING CABLE CONNECTION IN CENTER CONSOLE SYSTEM SHOULD OVERRIDE BLUETOOTH AUDIO AUTOMATICALLY
SELECTIONS MUST BE MADE USING TURN DIAL IN CONSOLE I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TOUCH SCREEN CAPABILITY
NAVIGATION NEEDS TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED VOICE RECOGNITION IS WORSE THAN I PHONE S SIRI ENTERING AN ADDRESS TAKES QUITE A BIT OF TIME
MY BIGGEST GRIPE ABOUT FACTORY INSTALLED NAVIGATION IS THAT THE MAPS ARE ALREADY OUT OF DATE AT TIME OF VEHICLE PURCHASE AND IT COSTS $300 TO UPDATE THE MAPS THE MOBILE APP WAZE DOES A BETTER JOB AS DOES A GARMIN DEVICE YOU CAN BUY FOR $100 AN
MAYBE THEY COULD ADD A TOUCH SCREEN
THE IPHONE MUSIC   PODCAST SELECTION IS NOT EASY DISPLAY ON THE MAIN SCREEN WOULD BE BETTER A BUTTON TO DISCONNECT THE HANDS FREE WOULD BE HANDY WHEN GETTING OUT OF THE CAR AND CONTINUING A CONVERSATION
COULD BE TOUCH SCREEN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE
THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE LACK OF DATA CONNECTIVITY SPEED COMING FROM THE BUILT IN T MOBILE 3G DEVICE IT MAKES ALL OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE COMMUNICATION INTERFACES PROVIDED IN THE VEHICLE LOOK USELESS THEY SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED THE OPTION OF LTE
THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM IS FLAWED AND VERY ANNOYING
HARD TO USE THE CONTROLS AS THERE IS NO TOUCH SCREEN
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE EASIER TO DIRECT WITH VOICE COMMANDS LIKE TALKING TO A REAL PERSON
GET TO THE CURRENT GENERATION OF GOOGLE MAPS THE INTERFACE THE TIMELINESS OF TRAFFIC STATUS AND REROUTING FOR FASTER ROUTE ALL SEEM 5 YEARS OLD
THE NAVIGATION IS HARD TO READ I THINK SO GIVING VOICE AND VISUAL COMMANDS SOONER WOULD BE HELPFUL
IPOD HOOK UP IS IN AN IMPOSSIBLE PLACE THE AUDIO RADIO SYSTEM IS IMPOSSIBLE TO QUICKLY ADJUST TOO MANY STEPS
USB IS IN AN INCONVENIENT LOCATION PLUS THE CONNECTOR DID NOT WORK FOR OUR PHONES I FEEL THAT WE SHOULD BE SENT A DIFFERENT ONE TO WORK WITH THE THE IPHONE 6 IN OUR OPINION THE TECHNOLOGY WAS OUTDATED THAT WE RECEIVED IPHONE 5 HAS BEEN OUT FOR
THERE IS NO TOUCH SCREEN NO APPS WORK WITH THE SYSTEM THE CONNECTION IS THROUGH BLU TOOTH FOR AUDIO SONGS AND PHONE SERVICE ONLY
VOICE ACTIVATION OF ENTERTAINMENT AND NAVIGATION FREQUENTLY NEEDS REPEATING OR IS NOT RECOGNIZED
THE TIMELINES OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MUCH IMPROVED
TOO MANY STEPS IN ENTERING THE ADDRESS ON NAVIGATION DON T RECOGNIZE MY VOICE MOST OF THE TIME IF I USE THE VOICE COMMAND
VOICE RECOGNITION ISN T THE GREATEST ALTHOUGH IT IS FAR BETTER THAN WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY WAS FIRST INTRODUCED ALSO I WOULD RECOMMEND THE ADDITION OF A PAUSE BUTTON WHEN PLAYING MUSIC MEDIA FROM A CONNECTED DEVICE
A FOLD DOWN NAV SCREEN WOULD BE WELCOMED AND THE DIRECTION OF THE DIALS USE IN COUNTERINTUITIVE TO THE STATES
EASE OF USE OF ENTERING DESIRED DESTINATION THIS COULD BE USER ERROR BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THIS
I REALLY EXPECTED THE AUDIO RADIO CD SOUND QUALITY TO BE BETTER
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CUMBERSOME AND THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS FRUSTRATING I USE MY CELL PHONE NOW
MY CAR S AUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM WORKS GREAT UNFORTUNATELY I NEED TO MASTER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I SUSPECT MASTERY WILL TAKE MORE TIME I MAKE INCORRECT VERBAL COMMANDS OR UNRECOGNIZABLE COMMANDS AND USING THE MASTER C
REAL TIME TRAFFIC INFORMATION AND ROAD BLOCKAGES
USB LOCATION RADIO INFO DISPLAY AS DEFAULT
I FIND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DIFFICULT TO USE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO AVOID HIGHWAYS ENTIRELY AND IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR
OFTEN LOSE CONNECTION DURING PHONE CALLS
NAV SYSTEM HARD TO PROGRAM AND SCREEN IS SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO SEE
SUPPORT ANDROID DEVICES FOR VEHICLE APPS USE VEHICLE S 3G CONNECTION FOR STREAMING MUSIC NOT CELL PHONE S DATA PLAN
THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONE CATEGORY BMW SHOULD INVEST MORE TIME MONEY INTO AS MENTIONED IN EARLIER COMMENTS BMW SHOULD MOVE AT THE SPEED OF TECHNOLOGY WITH ADVANCEMENTS IN CAR TECHNOLOGY COMPUTER SYSTEMS IT SHOULD BE EASY TO SET UP FLASHABLE UPD
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS POOR
GETTING INFO ON SATELLITE SYSTEM IS FRUSTRATING NEED TO TRY AND STUDY IT BUT NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY
IPHONE CONNECTEDNESS IS NOT AS SEEMLESS AS IT SHOULD BE
EASE OF STORING PREVIOUS AND CURRENT ADDRESSES
NAVIGATION VOICE ENTRY
AUDIO SYSTEM IS AVERAGE AT BEST FOR $65 000 VEHICLE
DON T LIKE DIAL TO SET NAVIGATION
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY
AUDIO MENU NOT GREAT AND USB LOCATION AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY ISSUES MAKE IT LESS BENEFICIAL
NAVIGATION GOOGLE MAPS SEEMS MORE ACCURATE IN TERMS OF ROUTE THAT IS QUICKEST
BETTER SPEAKERS AND TOUCH SCREEN FOR NAVIGATION IN PLACE OF TOGGLE
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE
WISH WE CAN INCORPORATE THIRD PARTY NAVIGATION APP LIKE WAZE TO THE CAR FACTORY NAVIGATION SCREEN
SATELLITE RADIO SOUND QUALITY IS HORRIBLE AS COMPARED TO CDS OR IPOD SOURCES
NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS GUIDED ME TO TAKE THE SLOWER ROUTE OFTEN EVEN THOUGH I SELECTED TO HAVE THE FASTEST ROUTE POSSIBLE
I AM NOT ABLE TO USE MY IPOD EASILY OR MY MUSIC COLLECTION THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM STILL NEEDS UPGRADES OFTENTIMES TAKES ME ROUND AND ROUND TO GET TO A DESTINATION RATHER THAN A DIRECT ROUTE FRUSTRATING
INTERFACE WITH THIRD PARTY SMARTPHONE PROVIDERS EASE OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION IN NAVIGATION DOESN T WORK EASILY
VOICE RECOGNITION NOT GREAT WAS BETTER IN MY 3 SERIES NAV SYSTEMS SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECORD A ROUTE SO I CAN ASK IT TO GET ME BACK TO A PREFERRED ROUTE RATHER THAN THE GPS COMPUTED ROUTE
USING THE NAV SYSTEM BY VOICE COMMAND IS NOT PERFECT SOMETIMES IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND ALL COMMANDS AND MANUAL IS NOT FLAWLESS EITHER NOT ALL ADDRESS LOCK IN
BLUETOOTH IS HORRIBLE DOES NOT CONNECT FAST ENOUGH AND DELAYED WHEN IT DOES CONNECT MY GMC TRUCK IS MUCH FASTER IPOD AND PANDORA NEVER UPDATE ON THE NAV SCREEN WHILE CONNECTED TO BLUETOOTH DEALER SAID YEA THAT NORMAL SO ITS A KNOWN PROBLEM S
I THINK THE TRAFFIC INFORMATION COULD BE MORE INFORMATIONAL IDEALLY LOCATION OF LANES BLOCKED ETC
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY OFTEN DOES NOT WORK
IMPROVED SOUND QUALITY WHEN USING THE PHONE BETTER SPEECH RECOGNITION WHEN ENTERING DESTINATIONS
MY PHONE S AUDIO DOES NOT CONNECT VIA BLUETOOTH FROM TIME TO TIME IT S ANNOYING WHEN IT DOESN T AS THERE S NO REAL REASON WHY IT DOESN T CONNECT ABOUT 75% OF THE TIME
HAVE A FIRMWARE UPDATE ON MAKING THE SWITCH FROM DAYTIME LIGHTING TO NIGHTTIME LIGHTING BE AUTOMATIC MAKE MAP UPDATES FREE AND EASY OVER THE INTERNET MAKE IPHONES USE WITH COMMUNICATION FEATURES AVAILABLE SUCH AS RECEIVE AND READ TEXT MESSAGES A
MAP ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT AS NICE AS OTHER VEHICLES I LOOKED AT OUT OF DATE IPHONE 5 INTEGRATION SYSTEM NOT VERY USEFUL
THE LOOK OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS REALLY LOW QUALITY IF YOU DON T UPGRADE TO THE NAVIGATION PACKAGE IF YOU DON T HAVE NAV YOUR AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD STILL LOOK PREMIUM IT S A BMW EVEN FORD AUDIO SYSTEMS LOOK MORE PREMIUM THAN A 5 SERIES WITHOUT NAV
I KNOW I PURCHASED THE LOWEST RADIO MODEL BUT I WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED THAT IN A BMW DOESN T AUTOMATICALLY COME WITH BLUETOOTH THAT WILL NOT ONLY TRANSMIT PHONE CALLS BUT ALSO RADIO RECEIVED THROUGH AN IPHONE ALSO MY VOLVO C30 CAME
NEED TO BE ABLE TO STREAM CONTENT FROM PHONE EASELY USING BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
THE SCAN BUTTON ON STEERING WHEEL SEEMS TO MOVE ONLY TO PREPROGRAMMED RADIO STATIONS INSTEAD OF ALLOWING ME TO SCAN TO A NEXT STATION ON RADIO DIAL
NAVIGATION CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE THE TRAFFIC ALERT SYSTEM IS VERY POOR DOES NOT SHOW TRAFFIC SPEED OF EACH HIGHWAY ONLY GIVES HAZARD ALERTS
TWO THINGS THAT STAND OUT IN MY MIND ONE IS THAT THE NAVIGATION AND ENTERTAINMENT CONTROLS ON THE SCREEN ARE STILL A LITTLE SLOW AND CRYPTIC AND WHEN USING HANDS FREE CALL THE AUDIO OF THE CALL ALMOST SOUNDS HOLLOW OR LIKE I AM SPEAKING TO SOM
NAVIGATION IS NOT EASY TO SWITCH FROM ONE TYPE TO ANOTHER NAVIGATION DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION AND DOES NOT ALWAYS SELECT GOOD ROUTES
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION BETTER MORE ACCURATE GPS GUIDANCE
NAVIGATION DISPLAY CONTRAST ESPECIALLY WITH GRAY BACKGROUND DESIGNATING TOWNS IS OFTEN NOT GOOD FOR A QUICK GLANCE WHILE DRIVING NAV UNIT DOES NOT DISPLAY ROAD NAMES FOR REFERENCE OFTEN ENOUGH POINTS OF INTEREST OFTEN NOT UP TO DATE
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT CONSISTENT
THIS MODEL DOESN T GET THE HIGHER GRADE VOICE CONTROLS AND PHONE CONTROLS AS THE X3 THAT S WRONG
WORKING WITH MY GALAXY S5
I D LIKE TO USE VOICE CONTROL BUT I DON T BECAUSE IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND WHAT I SAY DON T KNOW IF I TALK FUNNY OR SYSTEM CAN T DISCRIMINATE VERY WELL USING THE NAV WITHOUT VOICE TAKES TOO LONG TO DIAL IN THE INFO I DEFAULT TO GOOGLE MAPS ON MY
IT S A BIT EARLY FOR EITHER OF US TO ADEQUATELY COMMENT BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE CD SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD AND THE RADIO IS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT IN OUR LINCOLN LS OR THIRD VEHICLE A 14YEAR OLD JEEP THE NAV SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD PROBABLY EXC
THE CONNECTIVITY TO OLDER GENERATIONS OF SMARTPHONES IS LACKING WHICH MIGHT BE UNAVOIDABLE I HAD A SLIGHTLY DATED IPHONE WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR AND IT DIDN T COMMUNICATE WELL WITH MY CAR
IT IS DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE AUDIO SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY AND NEED TO USE THE I DRIVE CONTROLLER MORE PHYSICAL CONTROLS BUTTONS WOULD MAKE IT EASIER
USELESS NAVIGATION SYSTEM BELOW AVERAGE AUDIO SYSTEM
SIMPLIFY NAVIGATION MUST BE MORE INTUITIVE THE ICONS ARE TOO CRYPTIC AND HARD TO FIGURE
THE VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM HAS NEVER GOTTEN A COMMAND CORRECT REGARDLESS OF HOW HARD I HAVE TRIED TO TRAIN MYSELF TO IT WHICH IS BACKWARDS CONVERSELY THE VOICE COMMANDS ON MY IPHONE ARE BETTER THAN 75% ACCURATE WITHOUT ANY TRAINING THE GPS HAS
SOUND QUALITY FROM SPEAKERS IS UNEXCEPTIONAL
WILL BE BETTER IF THERE S A CARPLAY WITH IPHONE OR GOOD COMPATIBLE WITH THE BLUETOOTH FUNCTION
HARD TO USE CENTER CONTROLS WHEN DRIVING STILL CAN T FIND A SCAN FEATURE FOR THE RADIO DO NOT LIKE THAT THE MEMORY BUTTONS FOR THE RADIO ARE SET TO BLUETOOTH EVEN WHEN THE MEDIA IS CHANGED TO RADIO EXAMPLE 1 IS ALWAYS SET TO MY HUSBANDS CE
IT SEEMS MORE GEARED FOR IPHONE AND APPLE THINGS THAT S JUST SILLY
SEEMS THE RECEIVING PERSON OF A PHONE CALL FROM THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION OF THIS CAR SOMETIMES HAS A HARD TIME HEARING DRIVER PASSENGER SOMETIMES SEEMS TO HAVE STATIC EVEN WITH FULL RECEPTION ON BOTH ENDS
THE TOUCH SCREEN STEREO CONTROLS ARE SIMPLY TERRIBLE THEY DIVERT TOO MUCH TIME AND ATTENTION FROM DRIVING
AFTER PRESSING THE VOICE COMMAND BUTTON THE VOICE COMMAND INSTRUCTIONS CHOICES FOLLOW IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS THE INSTRUCTIONS CAN BE INTERRUPTED BY PRESSING THE COMMAND BUTTON AGAIN BUT YOU STILL GET THE INSTRUCTIONS STARTING IMMEDIATELY YOU
LESS TOUCH SCREEN MORE VOICE CONTROL
BETTER SOUNDING SPEAKERS AND SUBWOOFER MY TL SOUND SYSTEM WAS BETTER MUCH FULLER SOUNDALIKE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE NAVIGATION WHILE DRIVING SO SHINES TOO DANGEROUS YO PULL OVER BETTER TO BE ABLE YO USE WHILE DRIVING
VOICE RECOGNITION IS DIFFICULT TO USE USUALLY INPUTS WRONG DATA WHEN USING VOICE COMMAND
I WISH THEY WOULD KEEP UPDATED ON TECH ADVANCES WITH PHONES ETC
I HAVE AN IPHONE 6 AND I REALIZE IT IS NOT AN ACURA ISSUE AS MUCH AS APPLE PROVIDING A SOFTWARE UPDATE SO YOU CAN USE THE FULL FUNCTIONALITY OF THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM OF THE ACURA TLX I AM STILL IMPRESSED WITH THE OVERALL QUALITY OTHERWISE I
CENTRAL ON SCREEN CONTROLS ARE A LITTLE COMPLICATED AND NOT ALWAYS INTUITIVE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY
I VE HEARD THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT SOUND GOOD FROM THE RECEIVING END
MY 1997 BOSE SYSTEM IN MY ACURA CL 3 0 WAS BETTER THAN THE KRELL SYSTEM IN MY RLX
TAKES SEVERAL TRIES FOR VOICE RECOGNITION AND SOMETIMES I CAN T EVER GET IT TO RECOGNIZE MY VOICE AND I GIVE UP
WITHOUT HAVING THE IPOD INTEGRATION PLAYING MUSIC FROM AN IPOD IS NOT EASY TO NAVIGATE WHILE DRIVING SINCE IT HAS TO BE DONE THROUGH THE IPOD
TOUCH SCREEN AND CONTROLS ARE VERY GOOD BUT TAKES TOO LONG TO LOOK AT SCREEN AND SELECT EASIER CONTROL ON THE STEERING WHEEL WOULD BE GOOD
I WISH I COULD USE THE CARS AUDIO PANEL TO CONTROL MY IPHONE
VOICE RECOGNITION DOESN T RECOGNIZE MY NORTHERN VOICE EASILY
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAVIGATION AND PHONE CALLS IS INFURIATING ESPECIALLY IN A PRESTIGE CAR S3
WHEN STREAMING MUSIC VIA BLUETOOTH THERE SHOULD BE SOME WAY TO CONTROL THE MUSIC IE THROUGH THE AUDI SYSTEM RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT IS SET UP YOU HAVE TO CONTROL THE MUSIC THROUGH THE PHONE
CD TRANSFER TO HHD NEEDS SOME FINE TUNING PERHAPS ALL CD S WOULD BE RECORDED TO HHD WITH OPTION TO ERASE
NEED FOR THE PASSENGER TO ACCESS NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO AID DRIVER WHILE DRIVING
CHANGING OR ACCESSING RADIO STATION NOT PREPROGRAMMED USE OF GOOGLE MAPS ACCESSING AND UTILIZING CELL PHONE MUSIC PRIOR AUDI WOULD JUST PICK UP ANYTHING I WANTED TO USE FROM MY PHONE NO SWITCHING TO MEDIA ETC
NEEDS THE SYNC WITH PHONE AND MUSIC PLAYER WITH BLUETOOTH ALSO CAN T DETERMINE IF THE AUDIO IS COMING FROM EITHER BLUETOOTH OR USB
THE AUDIO CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL ARE NOT INTUITIVE AND PUTTING DIALS ROLLERS ON THE WHEEL SEEMS DATED AND OLD TECHNOLOGY ALSO THE RADIO HAS NO FAVORITE BUTTONS AND NO EASY WAY TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN FAVORITES UNLESS THE FAVORITES ARE DISPLA
IMPROVE BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY AND EASE OF SELECTING ITEMS UPON ENTERING INFO INTO NAVIGATION
I REALLY REALLY REALLY WISH IT HAS A USER SELECTABLE EQUALIZER
THE SYSETEM FOR FINDING ADDRESSES IN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A LITTLE CUMBERSOME
DIFFICULT TO CHANGE STATIONS IF NOT USING VOICE RECOGNITION DIFFICULT TO SWITCH BETWEEN FM AND XM MAP SCREEN FOR NAVIGATION VERY SMALL TO READ TAKES TOO LONG TO INPUT ADDRESSES CAN T USE PHONE NUMBER TO FIND LOCATIONS
SIRI EYES FREE NEEDED OR CARPLAY
AGAIN I FEEL A DESIGN ISSUE ON ANSWERING YOUR HANDS FREE PHONE YOU MUST LOOK DOWN AT THE KNOB TO PUSH IT TO ANSWER THE PHONE AND HANG IT UP THE SOLUTION SHOULD BE A VERY EASY BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO ANSWER CALLS AND HANG UP CALLS THI
NAV SYSTEM IS INACCURATE AND CANNOT BE TRUSTED
READ AND SEND TEXT MESSAGES
GOOGLE MAPS INTEGRATION
MAKE AUDIO BLUETOOTH STREAMING STANDARD
STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS NOT USE FRIENDLY
PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT MY VOICE QUALITY IS NOT GOOD WHEN CALLING AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS EVEN THOUGH WINDOWS ARE CLOSED I TURN THE AC SYSTEM OFF BUT THEY STILL COMPLAIN ABOUT QUALITY
FASTER RESPONSE WHEN ENTERING DESTINATION ADDRESSES INTO NAVIGATION SYSTEM CALLERS ON OTHER END OF THE LINE SAY THERE IS BACKGROUND NOISE WHEN USING HANDS FREE TELEPHONE
TRAFFIC ON MAP ONLY COVERS MAJOR HIGHWAYS IT SHOULD SECONDARY ROADS ALL ROADS THAT COVER WHAT GOOGLE MAPS COVERS
THE NAV VOICE RECOGNITION IS A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT
I MISS VOICE CONTROL AND TOUCHSCREEN THE CIRCLE PAD YOU WRITE ON IS COOL THOUGH
PHONE COULD HAVE MORE VOICE RECOGNITION NUMBERS
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS TERRIFIC IN MANY RESPECTS MUSIC OF DIFFERENT GENRES SOUND CRISP CLEAR WITH RICH FULL SOUND ANY SOUND THAT HAS EVEN MODERATE BASS HOWEVER MAKES THE REAR SPEAKERS SOUND DISTORTED ALMOST LIKE THE SPEAKERS HAVE BLOWN I
INTERFACE IS HARD TO NAVIGATE BY TOUCH ALONE THE BUTTONS TO THE SIDES OF THE CONTROL KNOB ARE ALL FLAT AND NOT EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE BY TOUCH ALONE
I DON T KNOW HOW TO USE AND I WANTED VOICE ACTIVATED BUT FOUND OUT THAT IT DIDN T HAVE IT AFTER I BOUGHT CAR I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED
ADD WAZE NAVIGATION
ADD BACK THE USER EQUALIZER SETTINGS ESPECIALLY WITH THE $875 HARMAN KARDON PREMIUM SOUND UPGRADE NOT HAVING THIS FEATURE MAKES DRASTICALLY LIMITS THE SOUND SYSTEM S POTENTIAL OTHER PREVIOUS AND CURRENT MODELS HAVE THIS FEATURE BUT THE M235I D
THE TOUCH PAD LETTER RECOGNITION SYSTEM COULD USE SOME REFINING
BETTER LOCATION FOR USB PORTS VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM USAGE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND DECIDED I SIMPLY DON T HAVE THE TIME REQUIRED TO MEMORIZE ALL THOSE COMMANDS ETC SO IT S NOT BEING USED
GETTING FROM THE PHONE MENU TO THE ADDRESS BOOK SEEMS TO BE A MYSTERY I KEEP PUSHING THE CONTROL KNOB THROUGH SEVERAL CYCLES BEFORE THE PHONE NUMBERS COME UP IT SHOULD COME UP WHEN YOU TOUCH ADDRESS BOOK I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THE BLUETOOTH MENU K
NAVIGATION STILL DOES NOT WORK AFTER 3 MONTHS
USER INTERFACE FEELS A LITTLE BIT DATED AND NAVIGATION IS SOMETIMES A BIT CONFUSING
DIFFICULT TO CHANGE FROM FM TO AM TO SATELLITE NEEDS MORE PRESET BUTTONS
TOO MANY CLICKS TO GET TO RADIO PRESETS
VOICE RECOGNITION COMMANDS SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED MUCH BETTER IN THE MANUALS OR PROVIDE MORE INTUITIVE FLEXIBLE USE OF VOICE COMMANDS
THE SCREEN SUCKS AND IS HARD TO USE THE IDRIVE IS BETTER THAN IT USED TO BE BUT IT STILL SUCKS
SCREEN HAS TOO MUCH CLUTTER PRINTING TOO SMALL TO READ WHILE DRIVING TOO MUCH ACTIVITY IS CRAMMED INTO AN AUTOMOTIVE UNIT MOST OF THE DRIVERS ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE TECHNOLOGY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT AS EASY TO USE AS LAST ENCLAVE WE OWNED
BETTER IDRIVE CONTROL NAVIGATION MORE BUTTONS FEWER LEVELS OF SEARCHING FOR CONTROLS AND FUNCTIONS
SCREEN TOO SMALL ESPECIALLY FOR NAVIGATION
TECHNOLOGY IS OVERWHELMING TOO ME I M SURE I DON T USE ALL OF THE FEATURES BECAUSE I HAVEN T TAKEN THE TIME TO FIGURE OUT EVERYTHING
I DON T USE THE COMMUNICATION AND HAVE ONLY USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHEN I WAS USING ONSTAR S TURN BY TURN DIRECTIONS WHICH WAS ROUTED THROUGH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
BETTER ALTERNATIVE TRAFFIC ROUTES
NAVIGATION NAVIGATION NAVIGATION
TROUBLE GETTING IPOD TO CONNECT AND BE RECOGNIZED NEED DEALER SUPPORT
THE NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM IS HARD TO PUT THE INFO IN AND YOU NEED TO BE IN PARK TO THE ADDRESS PUT INTO IT
THEY COULD NOT HAVE MADE THE USE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ANY MORE CUMBERSOME AND UNATTRACTIVE EVEN IF TRIED THE MAP IS VERY BASIC WITH VERY FEW STREETS MARKED IN ANY SCALE MARKING STREET NAMES IS CONFUSING AND YOU REALLY DO
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS GARBAGE VERY POOR DESIGN
A LOT OF FEATURES DO NOT SEEM TO SYNC WITH MY IPHONE PROPERLY THE DEALER TOLD ME THIS WAS AN ISSUE WHEN I PURCHASED THE CAR THE BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WANT TO CONNECT FOR AUDIO
THE TOUCH SCREEN RADIO STATION SELECTION I HAVE TOUCHED THE DESIRED SELECTED STATION ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WITH NO RESPONSE THE RADIO PUSH BUTTONS WORKED BETTER
I DON T REALLY KNOW HOW TO USE THE POINTS OF INTEREST ON THE NAV SYSTEM
NAVIGATION HAVING THE ABILITY TO SET TO AVOID ROADS FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE A PORTABLE GPS THAT ALLOWS ME TO SET ROADS TO AVOID SO ANY GUIDANCE GIVEN IT WILL NOT TAKE THE ROADS THUS IF THERE IS A ROAD YOU DON T WANT TO DRIVE ON EXPRESSWAY OR S
TOUCH SCREEN HAS VERY LOW RESPONSIVENESS MUST TOUCH AND RE TOUCH MULTIPLE TIMES TO SELECT ANY FUNCTION OPTION TOUCH SCREEN IS A FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE EVEN AFTER REPEATED CALIBRATION
SEE EARLIER COMMENTS ON PROBLEMS WITH NAVIGATION VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY INCONSISTENT WITH EITHER MALE OR FEMALE VOICE MAKING REQUESTS
PEOPLE CANNOT HEAR ME AT THEIR END WHEN I USE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION THEY SAY IT SOUNDS LIKE I AM STANDING BY A STREAM RUSHING OVER ROCKS
THE KEYPAD TO ENTER NAVIGATION INFO
THE WIND NOISE PREVENTS QUALITY CALLS AND THE TOUCH SCREEN OFTEN HAS TO BE PRESSED MULTIPLE TIMES TO GET THE DESIRED FEATURE
VERY DIFFICULT TO USE TOUCH SCREEN TO CHANGE CHANNELS WHILE DRIVING JUST LEARNING TO USE VOICE RECOGNITION INSTEAD
GET THE BLUETOOTH WORKING BETTER
THE VOICE COMMANDS PROVIDE UNNEEDED FRUSTRATION MANUAL WORKS BETTER
I DONOT USEVOICE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM
HARD TO TELL UNTIL I GET MORE FAMILIAR WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM HAVE YET TO DRIVE THE CAR MUCH AND AM STILL LEARNING
HAVEN T USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT THAT IMPORTANT TO HAVE FOR ME
EASE OF THE TOUCH SYSTEM
USB PORT COULD BE IN A MORE ACCESSABLE AREA
BETTER INTERFACE TO USB DEVICES
TOUCH SCREEN DISPLAY FOR CHANGING RADIO STATIONS IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN DRIVING
THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW AND THE NAV SYSTEM IS NOT AS GOOD AS USING GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE I WISH I HAD NOT PAID EXTRA FOR THE NAV SYSTEM
JUST WISH IT HAD A BOSE SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED TO ENTER MULTIPLE STOP ALONG THE WAY FROM START TO FINAL DESTINATION
VOICE RECOGNITION IT IS NOT JUST ME IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND I HAVE HAD OTHERS TRY IT TOO
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I AM RATING IS ONSTAR NOT THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM THE SURVEY NEEDS TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO I OWNED A VERANO AND GREW TIRED OF COMPLAINING ABOUT THE VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM IT WAS ALWAYS MY FAULT THAT IT
DOES NMOT RESPOND WELL TO MY VOICE FOR NAVIGATION
PROGRAMMED CHANNELS ON MULTIPLE SCREENS SEEMS A LITTLE HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND NAVIGATE THROUGH ESPECIALLY WHILE DRIVING BUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS THE MOST DIFFICULT THING TO USE AND UNDERSTAND PLUS THE ACCURACY NEEDS IMPROVING AS DESCRIBED
TOUCH SCREEN AND ON STEERING WHEEL CONTROL ON RIGHT SIDE NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY
IT IS HARD TO FIND MY FAVORITE STATIONS BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY PLACES WHERE THEY CAN BE MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND VOICE ACTIVATED SYSTEMS HAVEN T WORKED SINCE AFTER I DROVE MY CAR THE DAY AFTER I BOUGHT IT THE SALES REP WAS UNABLE TO CONNEC
THE WHOLE INTELLILINK SYSTEM JUST DOES NOT SEEM POLISHED YET I M HOPING FOR SOME TYPE OF SOFTWARE FIRMWARE UPDATE TO MAKE IT RESPOND TO VOICE COMMANDS BETTER CONNECT TO PHONE VIA USB AND BLUETOOTH MORE QUICKLY AND HAVE THE NAV SYSTEM NOT INTER
I MAINLY DRIVE IN AN AREA THAT I KNOW SO I DON T USE THE NAVAGATION SYSTEM PLUS I FIND IT HARD TO UNDERSTAND UNLESS A PERSON USES IT OFTEN
INFORMATION ON HOW TO GET SOME OF THE AVAILABLE APPLICATIONS IS A BIT THIN I M HAVING A CHALLENGE GETTING PANDORA BUT I LL ASSUME ITS BECAUSE I ONLY CARRY A TABLET AND DO NOT HAVE AN I PAD OR CELL PHONE IT S NOT EXPLAINED VERY WELL IN
EVEN THOUGH I VE ONLY LOOKED THROUGH IT THE BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T APPEAR TOO USER FRIENDLY
THE NAVIGATION IS NOT SIMPLE TO USE I STRUGGLE WITH THIS FEATURE IT WILL BE SIMPLER WHEN USED MORE OFTEN BUT ITS HARDER TO PROGRAM THAN IN MY LAST VEHICLE A PRIUS
THE TOUCH CONTROLS ARE NOT AS RESPONSIVE AS I WOULD LIKE NEED TO REPEATEDLY TOUCH TO PUT ON HEATED SEATS AND CHANGE THE TEMPERATURE
THE VOICE QUALITY OF PHONE CONVERSATIONS
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DEFINITELY THE WEAKEST LINK NOT ITS OPERATION BUT THE DIRECTIONS IT GIVES ARE CONVOLUTED I VE FOUND MYSELF 1 2 MILE AWAY FROM MY DESTINATION BUT THE DIRECTIONS TOOK WAY OUT OF THE WAY THE DIRECTIONS GOT ME THERE
I DO NOT DO MUCH DRIVING AND WHEN I DO I WANT NO DISTRACTIONS HENCE I RARELY IF EVER USE THEM
THE CUE IS HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING THE INTERFACE IS A LITTLE TOO INVOLVED TO FOCUS ON WHEN DRIVING SAFELY IMPLEMENTING ALTERNATE OPTIONS SUCH AS APPLE CARPLAY OR ANDROID AUTO MIGHT BE A GREAT WAY TO GO
THE STYLING IS VERY SLEEK BUT THE PHRASING OF COMMANDS CAN BE SHORTENED TO MAKE IT MORE USER FRIENDLY THE VOICE COMMAND OPTIONS SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO BE INTERRUPTED WHEN THE COMMAND THE USER IS LOOKING FOR IS FOUND
A TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE THE MOST HELPFUL FOR MANUAL CONTROL USING THE DIAL CAN BE A BIT FRUSTRATING AND DISTRACTING
THE REAL TIME TRAFFIC FEATURE WORKS PRETTY POORLY IN MY OPINION I RARELY GET ALERTS OF ANY TRAFFIC PROBLEMS WHEN ROADS ARE COMPLETELY STOPPED MY OLD GARMIN DID MUCH BETTER
NEED A HIGHER QUALITY OF SPEAKERS AND AUDIO SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION IS POORLY DESIGN THOUGH SCREEN IS NICE THE SCREEN SHOULD BE FURTHER FORWARD AND CHANGED TO A TOUCH SCREEN I NEED TO SCROLL THROUGH LETTERS AND PUSH BUTTON IN ORDER TO USE THE SYSTEM I OFTEN USE MY PHONE BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG T
THE BLUETOOTH ISN T VERY A VERY CLEAR CONNECTION
STILL HARD FOR COMPUTER TO UNDERSTAND VOICE COMMANDS
CAN NOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE AUDIO CONTROL SYSTEM AND THE GPS SYSTEM HAVE TRIED MULTIPAL TIMES AND HAVE GONE BACK TO USING MY HAND HELD GARMIN GPS WHICH IS RIDICULOUS
THE VOLUME OF READING TEXTS
USE OF IPOD VIA USB AND CUE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
I LOOKED AT THREE CARS BEFORE MAKING MY DECISION I OWNED A MERCEDES 350 WHICH I DID NOT RE LEASE NAVIGATION AND AUDIO SYSTEM WHERE POOR I LOOKED AT THE FSPORT LEXUS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE EXCELLENT SOUNDING AND WAY EASY TO USE AND GREAT GRAPHIX
NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND IF NOT COMPUTER SAVVY OR DO NOT HAVE A NEWER STYLE CELL PHONE
CORRECT INPUTS TOO MUCH REPEATING
PARTNER WITH VERIZON INSTEAD OF AT&T FOR INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AND IMPROVE CHARGING CAPABILITY OF THE CRADLE HOLDER IN CONSOLE TO INCUDE MORE THAN THE DROID RAZOR WHEN ALL THE WORLD HAS APPLE IPHONES
CUE IS GREAT ONCE YOU GET HE HANG OF IT BUT A DIAL   CONTROLLER SYSTEM WOULD BE EVEN EASIER
DON T LOVE THE TOUCH SCREEN IT S ALWAYS DIRTY FROM BEING TOUCHED
I DON T TEXT OR ANSWER MY PHONE WHILE DRIVING I DON T HAVE AN IPAD OR ANYTHING TO ATTACH TO THE SYSTEM THE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM DOES NOT REALLY APPLY ITS NOT THAT I DON T LIKE IT I JUST DON T HAVE ANY DESIRE TO USE IT
I LIVE IN NEW MEXICO WITH VERY BRIGHT SUNLIGHT AND I CAN T ALWAYS SEE THE BACK UP CAMERA S IMAGE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT GIVEN THE LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY IN THE ENCORE AND AS FAR AS I KNOW NO WAY TO INCREASE THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS ON FOR THE BACK U
DIFFICULT TO USE VOICE COMMANDS
THE VOLUME OF THE TURN BY TURN NAVIGATION THE VOICE THAT COMES THROUGH THE SPEAKERS IS WAY TO LOW YOU MUST LOWER THE MUSIC VOLUME TO DRIVE AND LISTEN FOR DIRECTIONS
TOUCH SCREEN DIFFICULT TO USE WHILE DRIVING BUT MAY BE ONLY WAY TO GET AUDIO SYSTEM TO PLAY MUSIC CORRECTLY SOMETIMES IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE THE USB SO YOU HAVE TO DISCONNECT IT AND PLUG IT BACK IN DRIVER CAN T REALLY DO THIS UNLESS THEY PULL O
ONSTAR STILL DOES NOT HAVE MY HOME ADDRESS IN ITS SYSTEM CORRECTLY TAKES PEOPLE 1 5 MILES PAST MY HOUSE 4015 SW HIGHWAY J PLATTSBURG MO I THINK THE SYSTEM OTHERWISE WORKS BEAUTIFULLY
VOICE RECOGNITION IS THE WORST I HAVE SEEN
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DESTINATION FEATURE SIMPLIFIED BY STATING THE STATE THEN CITY THEN THE ACTUAL ADDRESS
SIMPLIFY CUE SYSTEM SO IT S EASIER TO USE
I FIND THE SOUND QUALITY WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE PHONE SYSTEM TO BE VERY POOR PEOPLE CANNOT HEAR ME AS THEY SAY IT SOUNDS LIKE I HAVE MY CAR WINDOWS DOWN WHICH I DO NOT I HAVE STOPPED USING HANDS FREE
I WOULD PROBABLY GIVE THIS AN OUTSTANDING 7 IF THE HEADPHONES WOULD WORK I HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH THE VOICE COMMAND BUT I DON T USE ANY OF THIS VERY OFTEN SO IT IS HARD TO RATE
PLEASE IMPROVE IPHONE CONNECTIVITY AND ENABLE BLUETOOTH BROWSING
I VE HAD ISSUES FORM DAY ONE REGARDING THE HANDS FREE PHONE AND USB CONNECTION
NAV IGATIONWORKS FINE BUT LACKS USER FRIENDLYNESS OF STAND ALONE GARMAN S GPS SYSTEMS AUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS SUPERIOR WITH FANTASTIC SOUND WAY POINTS OF PLACES I AM INTEREST IN ARE HARD TO SAVE AS THE SAVING SYSTEM IS OVERLY COMPLICATED
NAVIGATION DOESN T ALWAYS RECOGNIZE POINTS OF INTEREST WHEN SPEAKING OR TYPING IT MAY BE SLIGHTLY OFF FROM WHAT IT KNOWS IT S IN THE MEMORY BUT NOT HOW WE TYPE SAY AND IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE IT
CAN T REALLY SAY YET SINCE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WASN T WORKING IT S PRESENTLY AT THE DEALERSHIP BEING REPAIRED
THE TWO HUGE ISSUES I HAVE REGARDING THE AUDIO VIDEO SYSTEM ARE THE LACK OF SEEK UP AND SEEK DOWN BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL FOR THE FM AND XM RADIO STATOINS YOU CAN ONLY USE THEM UP AND DOWN BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL TO SCAN THRU PRE PROG
HARD DRIVE FOR MUSIC MEMORY
DO NOT LIKE THE TOUCH SCREEN AND THE FACT MOST FUNCTIONS CAN NOT BE ADJUSTED WHILE DRIVING STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS HELP BUT HARD BUTTONS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR A C STEREO NAV
VOICE RECOGNITION NEED IMPROVEMENT
HANDS FREE PHONE SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED PEOPLE I CALL COMPLAIN THEY HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING ME
IT SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS GOOGLE MAPS
EASIER TO USE TOUCH SYSTEM
FOR PEOPLE USING THE BUILT IN WIFI HAVE MORE BUILT IN CAPABILITIES SUCH AS GETTING WEATHER TRAFFIC VIA WIFI RATHER THAN THRU SIRIUS XM INTEGRATE WITH MORE MUSIC STREAMING APPS ONLY SUPPORTS PANDORA
RADIO CONTROLS FOR CHANNEL SELECTION ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND OFTEN UNABLE TO PICK A DESIRED STATION CAUSING THE SYSTEM TO BE TURNED OFF OUT OF FRUSTRATION
TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS COULD BE EASIER TO USE
REAR SEAT VIDEO SCREEN CREATES A BLIND SPOT SCREENS SHOULD BE IN SEAT BACKS
MORE IPHONE INTEGRATION
HARD TO NAVIGATE BETWEEN SYSTEMS
NEED TO IMPROVE MORE ON THE NAVIGATION & BLUETOOTH
THE VOICE ACTIVATED FEATURES NEVER WORK THE SYSTEM CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE ASKING IT TO DO
NEED APPS ON MYLINK THAT UTILIZE FEATURES OF TRAVEL LINK BY SIRIUS XM ALSO ABILITY TO ADD MY OWN APPS STITCHER TUNE IN RADIO ETC
ONSTAR HANDS FREE CALLING I MUST REPEAT THE NAME OVER AND OVER DID NOT HAVE THIS PROBLEM IN MY PREVIOUS CADILLAC
SHOULD BE ABLE TO INSTALL MUSIC APPS ON THE MYLINK SYSTEM
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR GPS ADDRESS AND STREET IDENTIFICATION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM HAS PROBLEMS SEE EARLIER NOTE SOUND VIA PHONE ON CALLS IS SOMETIMES QUITE POOR QUALITY
DOESN T ALWAYS SYNC TO MY PHONE RIGHT AWAY SO I SOMETIMES GET DIRECTED TO ON STAR INSTEAD
VOICE RECOGNITION IS USELESS IN FAIRNESS SO IS FORD SYNC THEY ARE USELESS
MORE INFORMATION ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM SUCH AS ETA TO DESTINATION
THE CUE SYSTEM IS MUCH TOO COMPLICATED AND IS GOING TO CAUSE DISTRACTED DRIVER ACCIDENTS
BETTER FASTER VOICE RECOGNITION
BACK TO THE VOICE RECOGNITION BEING MISINTERPRETED
GO BACK TO KNOBS RATHER THANTOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS
BETTER EDUCATION AND DESCRIPTION OF HOW TO USE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY SEEMS LIKE THERE IS MORE AVAILABLR THAN WHAT I USE THE PROBLEM IS THE PURCHASE PROCESS TAKES SO LONG THAT THEY DON T SPEND ENOUGH TIME TRAINING AND SETTING UP THE FEATURES
BEING ABLE TO SELECT FROM MULTIPLE ROUTES WHEN SELECTING A DESTINATION THE OVERALL COMPUTER SYSTEM IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE I PROGRAMMED AND DESIGNED COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR OVER 40 YEARS AS A PROFESSION AND I FIND THE SYSTEM CLUMSY
IT IS NOT USER FRIENDLY ESPECIALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY A MOVIE
QUICKER TRANSITION FORM REAR VIEW CAMERA TO AUDIO WHEN SWITCHING GEARS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM CUTS OFF THE WORDS WHEN GIVING DIRECTIONS I HAVE NOT FOUND THE REPEAT BUTTON YET
VOICE RECOGNITION IS FRUSTRATING
I FIND IT ODD I HAVE 5 USB PORTS IN THE FRONT AND 0 IN THE BACK
COULD BE EASIER TO SWITCH BETWEEN BLUETOOTH CONNECTION AND BUILT IN PHONE SYSTEM
NO VOICE CONTROL OF IPHONE FOR MUSIC CHANGE DUE TO LACK OF BLUETOOTH STREAMING THAT OTHER VEHICLES AUTOMATICALLY HAVE WITHIN THE SAME PRICE RANGE AND VEHICLE CLASS
I HAVE NEVER USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
TOO MUCH DEPENDANCE ON THE TOUCH SCREEN
VOICE RECOGNITION IS SLOW AND SUBJECT TO ERRORS
THE BUTTONS ON THE SIDE OF THE TOUCH SCREEN ARE OFTEN HARD TO DISTINGUISH WHERE EXACTLY TO PUSH AND SOMETIMES DON T RECEIVE MY INPUT THE SEEK BUTTONS ALONG THE LEFT SIDE OF THE TOUCH SCREEN SPECIFICALLY
I LIKED THE FEATURE IN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE THAT YOU COULD RECORD YOUR CD S TO A JUKEBOX AND HAVE ALL THOSE SONGS AVAILABLE WITH A VOICE COMMAND FORD ESCAPE
ALL THAT STUFF IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND TRIES TO DUPLICATE EVERYTHING THAT IS ALREADY AVAILABLE AND EASY TO USE ON MY I PHONE SATELLITE RADIO AND ON STAR SEEMS LIKE A BIG WASTE OF MONEY
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE FOR SS MODEL A LOT OF MONEY FOR NO NAVIGATION
PREVIOUS DESTINATION LIST IN THE NAVIGATION LISTS DESTINATIONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE NAVIGATION IT ISN T USER FRIENDLY TO PROGRAM DESTINATIONS LIKE HOME
TRAFFIC INFORMATION DOES NOT SEEM TO REPORT PROPERLY OR ACCURATELY
DISPLAY SCREEN SHOULD BE LARGER
ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS A BIT ANNOYING AS IT MUST PLAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE MENU BEFORE AUTOPLAYING PREVIOUS YEARS YOU COULD SELECT PLAY THIS WAS A MANDATORY CHANGE DUE TO SOME REGULATION PROHIBITING A DRIVER PRESSING THE PLAY BUTTON THIS IS
A BETTER NAVIGATION GUIDANCE FASTER TOUCH SCREEN RESPONSE AS VIEWING THE MAP
I HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO CONNECT THE BMW APPS TO MY PHONE I VE CALLED TWICE AND STILL HAVEN T GOTTEN THE APP TO WORK
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT WERE TOUCH SCREEN
RADIO AND SIRIUS XM I HAD AN AUDI Q7 THAT WHEN POSITIONING OVER THE STATION IT SHOWED SINGER AND SONG THAT WAS PLAYING ON THAT STATION NOW I NEED TO CHOOSE TO SEE STATION NAME SINGER OR SONG NAVIGATION SYSTEM SO HARD TO STORE FAVORITE ADDR
CHECK OUT THE AUDIO SYSTEM ON THE PORSCHE CAYENNE THIS IS MY OTHER SUV AND THE SYSTEM IS MUCH BETTER
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAV SYSTEM IS USELESS I WISH I HAD GOTTEN THE UPGRADED SOUND SYSTEM FINDING A RESTAURANT VIA POINTS OF INTEREST WORKS LESS THAN HALF THE TIME
NAV SYSTEM IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE
SYSTEM TAKES TOO LONG TO ENTER INFORMATION PREFER TOUCH SCREEN WHICH IS EASIER
I PREVIOUSLY OWNED A BMW X5 AND LIKED THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS BETTER THAN THIS X5 IT WAS MUCH EASIER TO CHANGE CHANNELS IN MY OLDER X5
VOICE CONTROLS NEED TO BE IMPROVED
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED AND EASE OF USE OF NAVIGATION
I HAVE FOUND THAT WHEN I USE THE VEHICLE S HANDSFREE OPTION FOR MY IPHONE THAT THE PERSON I AM CALLING CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHAT I AM SAYING
MY UNDERSTANDING OF NAV SYSTEM GETTING AN ADDRESS FROM POI OR INTO ADDRESS BOOK ALSO THE NAV SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM FLEXIBLE ON DIFFERENT ROUTES THIS MAY BE MORE OF A USER PROBLEM I NEED TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH THE OWNERS MANUAL IT S HARD TO U
BETTER CONNECTIVITY TO APPLE IOS DEVICES
TOUCHSCREEN ENTRY
I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT HOW TO SAVE ADDRESSES IN NAVIGATION AND OTHER ASPECTS DOES NOT MEAN ANYTHING IS WRONG I JUST HAVE NOT HAD THE TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT YET
PHONE AND AUDIO WORK FINE NAV SYSTEM IS HARD TO INPUT ADDRESS INTO AND DIFFICULT TO USE INTERACTIVE MAP SYSTEM
NAVIGATION INPUT A LITTLE CUMBERSOME
SOUND QUALITY I HAVE THE UPGRADED STEREO AND IT S LOUD BUT NOT CRYSTAL CLEAR
SOUND QUALITY ON CALLS IS LESS THAN GOOD EVEN WHEN CONVERTIBLE TO IS UP SOMETIMES BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY TO PHONE FOR RADIO CONTROLS DOESN T WORK OR IS HARD TO CONNECT
SHOW ALL SONGS ARTISTS ALBUMS IN ONE PLACE REGARDLESS OF WEAR THEY WERE LOADED FROM CD OR MEMORY STICK AND SHOW THEM ALPHABETICALLY
SMOOTHER   EASIER INTEGRATION WITH PHONE AND BETTER HANDS FREE SOMETIMES I HAVE TO SAY A COMMAND A FEW TIMES OR SAY IT DIFFERENTLY FOR THE CAR TO UNDERSTAND
SYNC WITH PHONE SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC IT IS RANDOM AND FRUSTRATING
SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULTY HEARING ME WHILE USING THE HANDS FREE
BETTER COMMUNICATIONS ON ROUTE NAVIGATION SEE PREVIOUS COMMENTS
STEERING WHEEL RADIO CONTROLS REQUIRE TWO 2 FUNCTIONS TO CHANGE THE CHANNELS FIRST ONE DISPLAYS THE CHANNEL AND THEN USING THE THUMBWHEEL ONE CAN CHANGE THE CHANNEL REQUIRING ONE TO TAKE HIS EYES OFF OF THE ROAD SHOULD BE ONE UP OR DOWN FUNCTION
NAVIGATION ONLY USED WHILE PARKED PASSENGER LOCKED OUT
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO MUSIC ON PHONE IS GOOD BUT CAN T NAVIGATE TO SPECIFIC SONGS WELL DOESN T OFFER ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT THE MUSIC ON THE PHONE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS SEVERELY ANTIQUATED AND DIFFICULT TO OPERATE I EXPECT MUCH MORE FROM A LUXURY CAR
WOULD BE NICE TO AUTOMATICALLY RETURN TO PREVIOUS DISPLAY AFTER BACKING UP AND ACTIVATING THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE BUT IT TAKES A SIZABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO LEARN HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH IT AND OPERATE IT IT IS MENU DRIVEN WITH MULTIPLE LEVELS
NAVIGATION INTERFACE SHOULD BE AT THE LEVEL OF THE IPHONE OR ALLOW IPHONE MAP TO COMMUNICATE WITH CAR NAV TAKES TOO LONG TO INPUT ADDRESS EVEN WHEN WRITING VOICE NAV WORKS LESS THAN HALF THE TIME
VOICE RECOGNITION MISINTERPRETS TOO MANY WORDS
PHONE APP CONNECTIVITY AND CONNECTDRIVE BMW APP
THIS IS MY FIRST VEHICLE WITH VOICE ACTIVATION THE FIRST WITH I DRIVE QUITE FRANKLY THE AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGY IS SO OVERWHELMING THAT MUCH OF IT WILL END UP BEING UNUSED BECAUSE OF THE EFFORT IT WILL TAKE TO UNDERSTAND IT
VOICE RECOGNITION SHOULD BE MORE INTUITIVE NO MATTER WHAT SCREEN I M IN A PHONE CALL SHOULD BE A PHONE CALL I E CALL HEATHER SHOULDN T BE A DIRECTIONAL CALL SHOULD MAKE IT A CALL
DVD COULD BE PROVIDED TO SHOW HOW TO USE ALL OF THE FEATURES
FAILING TO DEFAULT TO BLUETOOTH ON RESTART I D RATHER HAVE NO SOUND THAN TO DEFAULT TO FM RADIO
I LOVE THE BLUETOOTH SATELITE AND WIFI FEATURES
PAIRING CONFLICTS CAR AND PHONE SYSTEM S CRASHEDS EXAMPLE GOOGLE MAPS AND VOICE RECOGNITION SOMETIMES DOESN T UNDERSTAND COMMANDS
WHILE THERE IS A GREAT AND WIDE VARIETY OF STATIONS TO LISTEN TO THERE ARE ONLY 6 SPOTS WERE YOU CAN SAVE THE STATIONS I WISH I COULD SAVE MORE BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD STATIONS I WOULD LIKE TO SAVE BUT I HAVE TO CHANGE STATIONS OFTEN
I OWN A CHEVY CRUZE WITH HANDS FREE TECHNOLOGY THE CRUZE S HANDS FREE FEATURE IS HEAD AND SHOULDERS BETTER THAN THE NEW EQUINOX S THE EQUINOX LOSES CALLS IS EXTREMELY LOUD WHILE DIALING AND OFTEN FORGETS THE BLUETOOTH PHONES
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT ADJUST WHEN THE ROUTE CHANGES AND MUST CALL AN ON STAR REP TO CHANGE COURSE IT CAN CAUSE A GREAT DEAL OF INCONVENIENCE WE NOW USE AN EXTERNAL NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS TOO COMPLICATED REQUIRING TO MANY BUTTONS TO BE PRESSED AND SCREENS TO PASS THROUGH MY OLD HONDA HAS A SIMPLER MORE DIRECT SYSTEM LIVE TRAFFIC IS NOT VERY GOOD MY PORTABLE TOM TOM IS ACTUALLY BETTER FOR LIVE TRAFFIC INFO
EXTERNAL USB PORT ON DASH
ALL THE FEATURES ARE SIMPLE AND EASY TO USE MY GRIPE IS THAT THE 11 SPEAKER BOSE SYSTEM SOUNDS ONLY FAIR MY LAST VEHICLE WITH A BOSE SYSTEM ONLY SOUNDED FAIR AS WELL NOT A FAN OF BOSE
THE USB CONNECTIVITY DOESN T WORK WITH MY CELLPHONE TO PLAY MUSIC IT BARELY CHARGES MY DEVICE PROPERLY EITHER I HAVE TO USE A USB STICK WHICH IS INCONVENIENT SEEING AS HOW I HAVE ALL MY MUSIC ALL ON ONE DEVICE ALREADY THE RADIO CONTROLS ARE
HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING A CALL BLUETOOTH PROBLEM
NOISE QUALITY WHEN USING HANDS FREE FEATURE
VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM MORE FUNCTIONAL
NO TRADITIONAL RADIO BUTTONS STEERING WHEEL ALLOWS ONLY 5 FAVORITES AND VOICE COMMAND IS FRUSTRATING FOR TUNING A STATIONS SYSTEM HAS TROUBLE DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN XM AND FM
I WOULD LIKE TO MUTE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ONLY I OFTEN USE MY WAZE APP INSTEAD BECAUSE I CAN TURN THE SOUNDS TO ALERTS ONLY
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT RELIABLE
BLUETOOTH NOT WORKING PROPERLY
LARGER NAVIGATION SCREEN
IT S A BIT DIFFICULT TO CHANGE AUDIO STATIONS BUT I THINK THAT S AN ONSTAR ISSUE WITH THEIR DESIGN OF THE DISPLAYS
I PREFER TO NOT USE ANY OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM ETC SO THAT I CAN FOCUS ON MY DRIVING I HAVE TAKEN MANY ADVANCED CORVETTE DRIVING SCHOOLS AND SAFE DRIVING CALLS FOR A SINGLE FOCUS DRIVING
RADIO STATION SELECTION COULD BE EASIER
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN MAKING A CALL TO A SPECIFIC NUMBER IS NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD
SHOULD HAVE BUILT IN NAVIGATION INSTEAD OF DIRECTIONS THROUGH ONSTAR
WHEN IN BLUETOOTH MODE EVERYTHING HESITATES BLUETOOTH TO CELL PHONE CONNECTION DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE DIALOG
UNLESS I JUST KNOW HOW TO DO IT I CAN T CHANGE FROM AM TO FM TO SATELLITE RADIO FROM THE STEERING WHEEL MY OLD MAXIMA COULD DO THAT
VOICE COMMAND FOR NAVIGATION
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO ACTUALLY RECOGNIZE COMMANDS
THE CHEVY MYLNK SYSTEM IS A LITTLE BUGGY WHEN USING MY IPOD ESPECIALLY THE DASHBOARD INTERFACE USING THE STEERING WHEEL
I NEED TO TAKE A ROAD TRIP AND USE THE NAVI SYSTEM MORE TO MAKE A MORE VALID EVALUATION
STEERING WHEEL RADIO CONTROLS BEHIND WHEEL COULD BE EASIER TO FEEL WHILE DRIVING KNOBS NOT BIG ENOUGH TO EASILY FEEL
THE QUALITY OF THE NAVIGATION DISPLAY IS NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS ONE I VE EXPERIENCED IN THE 2104 MALIBU LZ THE DIFFERENCE IS CLARITY AND CRISPNESS FRANKLY I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT THE SAME
THE NAVIGATION MAP IS UGLY AND OUT OF DATE I EXPECTED MORE FROM A $40K VEHICLE THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM SOMETIMES DOES NOT UNDERSTAND MY VOICE I M AWARE THAT IT NEEDS TO LEARN HOW I SAY THINGS BUT AT TIMES IT CAN BE A BIT FRUSTRATING I HA
NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS WERE WRONG ON 2 OCCASIONS WHEN I CALLED ON STAR
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS A MAP AND WOULD BE NICE IF YOU COULD USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ONSTAR ONE OF THE WORST SOUNDING HANDS FREE CALLING SYSTEMS I HAVE HAD
SOME OF THE CONTROLS HAVE YOU TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD NAMELY THE RADIO PRESETS
SHOULD INCLUDE XM RADIO AT NO COST   STANDARD
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK WELL
THE PHONE RECEPTION AND VOICE QUALITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE FORD F150 THAT I REPLACED THE RADIO STATION PRESETS HAVE TOO MUCH DELAY WHEN SWITCHING BETWEEN STATIONS
SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY TO USE THE NAVAGATION SYSTEM AS MUCH AS I PAID FOR THE TRUCK THAT S REDICULOUS
HAVE BETTER NAVIGATION OPTIONS AVAILABLE THAN JUST ONSTAR
TOUCH SCREEN DRAWS REQUIRES TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO USE WHILE DRIVING SHOULD BE WATCHING THE ROAD
BESIDES FAILURE OF SYSTEM TWICE IT SEEMS THE CHEVY AUTHORIZED MECHANICS DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REPAIR THE ONSTAR NAVIGATION GPS AND NEW ELECTRONICS INSTRUCTIONS ON USE COULD BE IMPROVED
HAVE NOT HAD VEHICLE LONG ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE ALL FEATURES WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IT AN DO AND HOW TO USE NAVIGATION SYSTEMS BETTER
USE OF NAV WHILE MOVING
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE NEVER SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND COMMANDS JUST NOT HAPPY AT ALL WITH MY LINK FORDS SYNC A MUCH MORE INTUITIVE SYSTEM AGAIN I AM A LIFELONG GM MAN I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE HANDS FREE ASPECT AND WAS VERY DISAPPOIN
ABILITY TO ENTER ADDRESSES INTO GPS WHILE THE CAR IS MOVING
THE HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS CAN BE A BIT HARD TO HEAR AT TIMES
THE NAVIGATION IS ONLY TURN BY TURN NO MAPS AT ALL AND IS TOTALLY DEPENDANT ON EXSPENSIVE ONSTAR SUBSCRIPTION THE OTHER SYSTEMS ARE VERY CONFUSING AND DIFFICULT TO USE ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING ALL THAT TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE GREAT AT HOME
I WISH IT COULD UNDERSTAND MY VOICE COMMANDS BETTER
BLUETOOTH COULD USE SOME CLARITY ADJUSTMENTS
BLUETOOTH DOESN T RECOGNIZE PHONE NUMBER NAMES OVER HALF THE TIME
REALLY WISH HAD A CD PLAYER KINDA DISAPPOINTED IT DOESN T HAVE ONE THOUGHT I COULD GET USE TO NOT HAVING ONE BUT I AM NOT
THE VOICE ACTIVATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE FASTER AND MORE ADEPT AT UNDERSTANDING SPEECH
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO UTILIZE WHILE DRIVING AND WOULD BE NICE IF IT COULD BE CONTROLLED WITH A DIAL WHILE DRIVING AND THE TOUCHSCREEN WHILE STOPPED
I THINK I WOULD USE IT S FULL CAPABILITY BUT PAYING PAYING PAYING FOR WIFI IS NEVER GONNA HAPPEN WHAT A WASTE YOU COULD SAVE COSTS FOR THE CUSTOMER TO GIVE THEM THE CHOICE WHETHER THEY WANT TO PAY EXTRA OR NOT AND DOWNGRADE THE EQUIPMENT THE
CELL PHONE AUDIO QUALITY WHEN PLAYING THROUGH VEHICLE AUDIO IS NOT VERY GOOD OFTEN CHOPPY UNREADABLE AND YOU MUST TURN UP THE VOLUME TO HIGH LEVELS TO HEAR THE CALLER
THE USB PORT AREA IS HARD TO OPERATE IF YOUR DRIVING LIKE UNPLUGGING YOUR CELL OR JUST REACHING YOUR CELL PHONE IN THAT AREA IS RATHER HARD
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CD PLAYER
MY SPARK IS BASIC AND LACKS THE NICE RADIO UPGRADES I WISH WIFI WAS MADE STANDARD THE LIGHTS THAT COME ON WHEN YOU UNLOCK THE CAR DOOR ARE GREAT I FEEL LIKE MY CAR GREATS ME AFTER A LONG NIGHT OUT
THE SOUND QUALITY VS ROAD NOISE YOU HAVE TO TURN THE RADIO UP SO LOUD TO HEAR IT OVER THE ROAD NOISE THE SPEAKERS START TO SOUND DISTORTED
MAKE NAVIGATION WIRELESS THROUGH BLUETOOTH ALSO UPGRADE THE USB CAR CHARGER
RELIABILITY OF INITIAL BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
I WISH IT HAD A CD PLAYYER
THERE REALLY SHOULD BE A GPS SYSTEM THAT I HAVE TO PAY FOR AN APP AND CONNECT A SMART PHONE FOR THAT IS JUST RIDICULOUS
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A CD PLAYER
WHEN CONNECTING YOUR PERSONAL DEVICE THROUGH AUXILIARY CABLE YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THE SAME VOLUME YOU ARE FROM REGULAR RADIO WHICH MAKES CERTAIN APPLICATIONS SOMEWHAT HARD TO HEAR THOUGH IT IS ONLY A MINOR PROBLEM
PUT IN A CD
I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE SIRUS XM
THE VOICE COMMAND SUCKS
A ADD A VOLUME KNOB THE CAPACITIVE  TOUCH ON THE DISPLAY ARE HARD FOR PASSENGERS TO ADJUST B ADDING AN ERGONOMIC PLACE TO REST PART OF THE HAND CAN STEADY THE HAND AND ALLOW FOR EASIER USE OF THE TOUCH SCREEN IF A RAISED PLACE WAS ON THE
I FIND MYSELF EASILY DISTRACTED WHILE DRIVING AND TRYING TO CHANGE THE AUDIO CONTROLS AN EASIER TO NAVIGATE SYSTEM WOULD BE MORE CONVENIENT
RARELY USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BECAUSE IT S EASIER TO USE GOOGLE MAPS ON THE IPHONE CONNECTED TO THE SYSTEM SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO GET TO XM RADIO FROM OTHER AUDIO SOURCES BECAUSE OF NO INTUITIVE WAY TO CHANGE BETWEEN XM AND RADIO
EXTERNAL DEVICES PHONE CALLS MP3 PLAYER ARE TOO QUIET WHEN PLAYING OVER THE CAR S SPEAKERS I HAVE TO TURN THE VOLUME UP FROM 10 15 TO ABOUT 25 I WOULD LIKE THE VOLUME TO BE NORMALIZED
WHEN YOU TURN OFF THE MUSIC THAT IS BEING PLAYED BY RADIO OR CD ONLY THE SOUND GOES OFF THE RADIO AND CD CONTINUE TO RUN YOU WILL SEE THE NEXT SONG BEING DISPLAYED ON THE NAVIGATION OR RADIO SCREEN EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO SOUND THEY CONTINUE TO AD
ONSTAR IS MOSTLY SHIIT AND THE BUILT IN APPS WORK EXCEPT THEY RE EITHER OVERPRICED REDUNDANT OR BOTH MOST PEOPLE HAVE CELL PHONES SO HOW ABOUT A USEFUL APP LIKE GOOGLE MAPS OR WAZE NOT SOME GARBAGE WHERE I HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE TO A MAP SERVICE
THE NAVIGATION APP AND BLUETOOTH CALL QUALITY I MENTIONED BEFORE
EASE OF OPERATION OF VIDEO SYSTEM
NAVIGATION IS HARD TO USE SHOULD BE MORE LIKE A STANDARD GPS
COULD SOUND BETTER AND BE BETTER AND HAVE CD PLAYER
THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WOULD BE BETTER IF SCREENS WERE BUILT INTO THE SEAT AS A STANDARD OPTION
IT IS DIFFICULT TO RUN THE DVD SYSTEM I HAD A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT HOW TO TURN ON THE VOLUME OF IT I ALSO STILL CAN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUSH PLAY WHEN THE CAR IS NOT IN PARK
THE RADIO SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING BUT WITHOUT THE NAVIGATION INSTALLED THE SYSTEM IS WORTHLESS MAKE IT SO WE CAN RUN A GARMIN OR OTHER SOFTWARE THROUGH THE USB PORT OR INSTALL NAVIGATION MAPS ON ALL VEHICLES
AGAIN AS I MENTIONED MY CAR IS SUPER BASIC I WISH MY CAR WAS MORE HIGH TECH THAT WAY I COULD ENJOY MY 45 MINUTE DRIVE TO WORK AND MY 45 MINUTE DRIVE BACK HOME A LOT MORE
CURRENTLY NAVIGATION ISN T WORKING HARD TO UNDERSTAND TO USE THE REAR VIDEO AND NAVIGATION SYSTEM USER MANUAL COMPLICATED AS WELL
IT IS DIFFICULT WHILE DRIVING TO SELECT AND CHANGE RADIO STATION FAVORITES IT IS NOT READILY DISPLAYED ON THE SCREEN IF USING THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS YOU HAVE TO HIT THE BUTTON TWICE AND BE QUICK TO SELECT BECAUSE IT QUICKLY VANISHES
MOVE THE DVD SCREENS INTO THE HEADREST OR MOUNTED ON REAR OF CENTER CONSOLE
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT ALWAYS REGISTER SPEAKERPHONE LOCATION DOES NOT WORK WELL WHEN WINDOWS ARE DOWN OR SUNROOF IS OPEN PLEASE FIX THIS DESIGN ISSUE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE EASIER TO SAVE FAVORITES
PROVIDE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT JUST ON STAR ON STAR VOLUME SHOULD BE LOUDER THAN RADIO AND NOT CONTROLLED BY RADIO VOLUME BUT BE AT AN ALWAYS HIGH LEVEL LIKE THE BLUETOOTH PHONE SYSTEM
A CD PLAYER WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE
FIX THE GPS ANTENNA PROVIDE GOOGLE MAPS ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN
CD PLAYER AND 4 SPEAKERS
WHEN USING THE TOUCH SCREEN I AM CONSTANTLY HITTING THE HAZARD LIGHT BUTTON THAT IS BELOW THE SCREEN IT S SO SENSITIVE AND COMES ON ABOUT EVERY TIME I AM TRYING TO USE THE SCREEN
I ENJOY USING ONSTAR FOR TRIP PLANNING AND FOR THE PHONE THAT IS HANDS FREE
THE IN CAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD DIRECTIONS FROM THE IPHONE
LOW END SPEAKER QUALITY ROAD NOISE COMPLICATES VOICE COMMANDS
HOW TO ACCESS ALL THE FEATURES ON THE TOUCH SCREEN COULD BE BETTER
VOICE RECOGNITION OF ADDRESSES
EASE OF USE BETWEEN PAGES OF FAVORITE SATELLITE STATIONS SHOULD BE IMPROVED ONLY WAY TO MOVE BETWEEN SCREENS IS TO REPEATEDLY PUSH THE BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL MY SUBURBAN ALLOWED YOU TO SELECT THE FAVORITES PAGE YOU WANTED BY PUSHING
INCLUDE NAVIGATION ON ALL MODELS AS I STATED BEFORE MY VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE THE NAVIGATION PACKAGE I WANTED TO USE MY IPHONE5 AND WAS NOT ABLE TO ONCE MY PHONE WAS PAIRED THE CAR DISABLED MY VOICE ON MY PHONE I HAD TO UN PAIR MY IPHONE5
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE MORE ACCURATE
SCREEN SHOULD BE HIGHER AND VOICE RECOGNITION IMPROVED
BETTER TRAINING ON THE TECHNOLOGY OR CLASSES FROM DEALER TO MAKE SURE ALL USERS ARE AWARE OF THE FULL FUNCTIONALITY
VOICE RECOGNITION IS VERY POOR I VE STOPPED TRYING TO USE IT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS HARD TO USE IS NOT ACCURATE AND CANNOT BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY I VE STARTED USING A PORTABLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES THE INFORMATION I NEED
ALL THESE SYSTEMS SEEM TO HAVE UNIQUE FEATURES SO I AM MEDIOCRE ABOUT THEIR USE I LIKE THE PASSENGER TO BE ABLE TO PUT THE ADDRESS IN THE NAV SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING ONSTAR TAKES CARE OF THAT FOR ME BUT I WOULD ALLOW AN OVERRIDE IF I COULD
KNOBS FOR CONTROLS NOT TOUCH SCREEN
I LIKE THE USB DEVICE AND USE IT ALL THE TIME I HAVE ABOUT 50 GB ON A 64 GB DRIVE WHEN I SHUTOFF THE VEHICLE AND START UP THE USB DRIVE HAS TO BE STARTED AGAIN AND DOES NOT REMEMBER THE LAST SONG IT PLAYED BUT DO TO SOME STRANGE REASON SOMETIM
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IS THE ONLY PROBLEM
HARD TO JUMP TO PLAYING NOW WOULD LIKE BUTTON ON STEERING WHEEL TO JUMP TO CURRENT STATION TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE IT
ADD VOICE TO TEXT AND MAKE NAVIGATION GOOGLE MAPS GOOGLE HAS NAVIGATION ALL FIGURED OUT ALREADY WHY REINVENT SOMETHING THAT ALREADY WORKS REALLY WELL
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SET A DEFAULT SOURCE FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM IF I CONNECT MY PHONE VIA USB TO CHARGE THEN IT STARTS PLAYING OFF THE USB SOURCE EVEN IF I ALREADY HAD IT SET UP OVER BLUETOOTH I WOULD BE FINE WITH THIS EXCEPT THAT MY SONGS ARE ALL
YES A KNOB FOR AUDIO AND FOR CHANGING STATIONS
VOICE RECOGNITION IS A BIT DIFFICULT TO RECOGNIZE WORDS THE BLUETOOTH SOMETIMES DISCONNECTS
STEERING WHEEL CONTROL THAT CONTROLS SOURCE AND ALLOWS YOU TOGGLE UP OR DOWN TO SELECT THE NEXT OR PREVIOUS FAVORITE RADIO STATION USB FILE IPOD ETC IS DIFFICULT TO USE WHEN TRYING TO SELECT NEXT PREVIOUS SELECTIONS IT SHOULD BE THE SAME AS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT VERY GOOD GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE IS SUPERIOR IN MOST EVERY WAY
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ENTER A DESTINATION INTO THAN MY CELL PHONE THERE IS AN OPTION TO SEND AN ADDRESS FROM MY PHONE VIA ONSTAR TO THE NAVIGATION WHICH WORKS OK I NEED TO TRY TO USE THE VOICE RECOGNITION MORE TO SEE HOW W
NAVIGATION ONLY AVAILABLE THRU ONSTAR NO MAP AVAILABLE FEEL DEALER SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR ABOUT THAT
THE TRAX S PRICE AND CONNECTIVITY FEATURES WERE THE MAIN REASON I CHOSE THIS VEHICLE OVER MANY OTHERS
THE INTERNET CONNECTION IS VERY SLOW PROBABLY WILL CANCEL AFTER TRIAL PERIOD BECAUSE IT TAKES TOO LONG TO DOWNLOAD ITEMS
PUT A CD PLAYER IN IT
WOULD LIKE VEHICLE TO HAVE CD PLAYER AND BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NOT SURE I LIKE THE LOCATION OF THE USB PORT
AUDIO CONTROLS ON STEERING WHEEL ARE GOOD TOUCH SCREEN NOT SO MUCH ALSO WHEN LISTENING TO AUDIO WHATEVER THAT BLUE PULSING SQUARE IS ON THE RIGHT IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO READ THE TIME AND TEMP TAKE NOTE THAT I HAVE NOT YET TAKEN THE T
WHEN MAKING A PHONE CALL THE VOICE RECOGNITION OFTEN MISTAKES THE NAME THAT I ASK TO CALL
BETTER QUALITY AUDIO EQUIPMENT DESPITE BEING THE LOW MODEL IT SHOULD STILL HAVE BETTER QUALITY STEREO OPTIONS FOR THE PRICE A CD PLAYER WOULD BE NICE A NAV SYSTEM WOULD BE GREAT AND FOR GOODNESS SAKES I SHOULDN T HAVE TO BUY AN EXTERNAL SIRI
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SEEK ON STEERING WHEEL CONTROL WHEN TRAVELING ANNOYING TO REACH TO DASH TO FIND AVAILABLE STATION
I LOVE HANDS FREE SPEAKER PHONE
A VEHICLE THIS NEW AND FOR THIS PRICE IS MISSING MULTIPLE FEATURES THAT ARE COMMON IN OTHER CARS THE STEERING CONTROLS FOR THE VOICE COMMAND ONLY WORK ON YOUR PHONE IF CAPABLE AND DOES NOT ALLOW MUSIC CONTROL THROUGH VOICE
BETTER DIRECTIONS FROM ONSTAR
I MISS MY CD PLAYER PREVIOUS CAR
SIRIUS XM IN ALL MODELS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DREADFUL AS IS VOICE RECOGNITION TOGETHER THEY RE WORTHLESS
BLUETOOTH DOESN T ALWAYS PICK UP THE MUSIC PLAYER ON MY PHONE THE NAV SYSTEM HAS GOTTEN ME LOST TWICE THANKFULLY MY PHONE GOT ME BACK ON TRACK I KNOW THE BOSE SYSTEM IN MY VOLT IS MADE FOR LOWER POWER CONSUMPTION BUT THE SOUND QUALITY IS RATHE
MAKE IT SO THE BLUETOOTH PICKS UP THE SOUND FROM MY PODCASTS INTERNET RADIO STATIONS ETC
PHONE SIGNAL VOICE CUTS OUT FAIRLY OFTEN DURING PHONE CALLS
IT DOES NOT ALWAYS RESPOND TO COMMANDS ALSO THE CHOICES OF THE RADIO STATIONS SELECTED FROM THE STARRING WHEEL CONTROLS I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SELECTION CHANGE ON THE STATION THAT IS SELECTED BASICALLY SCROLL WITH THE CHOICE THAT WAS CHOSEN
NOT FAMILIAR WITH USING NAV SYSTEM
MY NAVIGATION IS ONLY THRU ONSTAR  SHOULD BE AN INDEPENDENT SYSTEM
HANDS FREE CALLING IS TERRIBLE TERRIBLE
NAVIGATION IS OFF
COMPATABILITY WITH MP3 SCREEN IS TO BRIGHT NO CD PLAYER
THE NAVIGATION USER INTERFACE IS NOT INTUITIVE NOR USER FRIENDLY
THE AUDIO ENTERTAINMENT NAVIGATION COMPUTER SYSTEM SHOULD BE JUST LIKE ANOTHER SMART PHONE I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE MY PHONE PLAN S DATA PLAN BE ABLE TO INSTALL APPS AND MAKE CALLS THE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE A PROPRIETARY CHEVROLET OPERA
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY TO I PHONE IS AWESOME HOWEVER AT LEAST A SINGLE DISC CD PLAYER WOULD BE NICE AS AN ADDITIONAL MUSIC OPTION
AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY THE VOICE RECOGNITION CAPABILITY EITHER FAILS TO RECOGNIZE COMMANDS OR MISINTERPRETS THEM WHEN IT DOES THIS IS THE ONLY ASPECT OF THE SYSTEM WHICH I FIND UNACCEPTABLE
COULD INCLUDE SATELLITE RADIO FOR FREE
FIX THE NAVIGATION PROBLEMS MY OLD TOMTOM @ 1 3 THE PRICE IS TWICE AS GOOD
CD PLAYER SHOULD BE STANDARD I HAD NO IDEA THIS TRUCK DIDN T HAVE ONE
PHONE SERVICE YOU CAN NOT HEAR OR BE HEARD ON THE PHONE SYSTEM I DO NOT USE IT
VOICE CONTROL DOES NOT WORK
THE LOCATION OF IMPUT USB CURRENTLY IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE AND GET TO EASILY
FOR THE PRICE OF THIS VEHICLE AND THE ERA IN WHICH WE LIVE ONSTAR SHOULD NOT BE THE NAV SOURCE IT SHOULD BE A BASIC PART OF ANY TOUCHSCREEN MULTIMEDIA VEHICLE SYSTEM
TOUCH SCREENS DON`T FUNCTION TOO WELL IN COLD CLIMATES WHEN YOU ARE WEARING GLOVES
MY VEHICLE HAS NO NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION FUNCTIONS I ACCOMPLISH THOSE TASKS USING MY DEVICE
I WOULD LIKE TO TOGGLE THROUGH CHANNELS USING CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL THE CONTROLS ARE A BIT TOO FAR OUT OF MY REACH AND CAUSE ME TO HAVE TO LEAN OVER IN ORDER TO CHANGE STATIONS
THE SCREEN DISPLAY IS COUNTER INTUITIVE I DO NOT USE THE BUILT PHONE AS I HAVE MY I PHONE FOR CALLS THE TEXT MESSAGE CONTROLS DO NOTHING FOR BLUETOOTH PHONE COMMUNICATION I HAVE TO START THE COMMANDS BY USING THE PHONE FOLLOWED BY THE SIRI VOI
I PUT MY CD COLLECTION IN THE TRUCK WHEN I PURCHASED IT AND A COUPLE WEEKS AGO DECIDED TO PLAY ONE OF THEM SURPRISED TO FIND THERE IS NO CD PLAYER
ADD ANSWERING PHONE CONTROL TO STEERING WHEEL CONTROL CURRENTLY ONLY HAS HANG UP FEATURE
MAP VERY SLOW TO SCROLL AND DETAIL SUFFERS UNLESS ZOOMED IN VERY CLOSE WOULD BE NICE IF IT OPERATED MORE LIKE GOOGLE MAPS
GREAT STEREO SOUND SYSTEM GOOD NAVIGATION AVERAGE COMMUNICATION
TOUCH SCREEN COULD BE A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE TO TOUCH
AS STATED EARLIER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS THE WEAKEST LINK OF EVERYTHING THE CONTROLS ARE DIFFICULT SOMETIMES TO USE AND NAVIGATE IN THE RADIO THE LIVE WEATHER FEATURE IS SUPER USEFUL HOWEVER
CHANGING STATIONS BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL NOT CHANGING BETWEEN AM FM SIRUS SO EASILY ON THE STEERING WHEEL JUST CHANGING STATIONS
NEEDS TO HAVE A CD PLAYER AS PART OF THE PACKAGE THERE A LOT OF US OLD GUYS OUT THERE WITH LOTS OF CD S WE D LIKE TO PLAY ON SOMETHING THAT STILL SHOULD BE STANDARD FAIR IN A NEW VEHICLE AT THIS PRICE POINT
ACCURACY OF GPS MAP
ABILITY TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM QUICKLY AND USE IT EFFECTIVELY
SMARTPHONE APP TO UNLOCK AND LOCK IS THE BEST THAT CONTRIBUTES HIGHLY TO MY CRUZE EXPERIENCE THEN THE TOUCHSCREEN IS PRETTY GOOD ALONG WITH THE ABILITY TO PLAY MUSIC THROUGH MY SMART PHONE
THE CONNECTIVITY TO THE IPHONE SOMETIMES DISCONNECTS AND YOU HAVE TO CHANGE SOURCES AND CHANGE IT BACK TO GET IT GOING AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO TEXT MESSAGES WITH MY VOICE AND HAVE IT RESPOND BACK ON THE PHONE
VOICE RECOGNITION IN THE LAST 4 VEHICLES HAS BEEN POOR DOES NOT WORK
IPOD MUSIC TENDS O FREEZE SOMETIMES VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR AND BLUETOOTH MUSIC CONNECTIVITY CAN BE POOR SOMETIMES
MAKE IT EASIER FOR NON TECH SAVVY PEOPLE
SOUND QUALITY WHEN USING BLUETOOTH PHONE MAINLY MY QUALITY OF MY SOUND TO PARTY I M CALLING
FIX THE TOUCHSCREEN ADD CARPLAY
SLOW NAVIGATION POOR POIS DATABASE AND POOR REAL TIME TRAFFIC ENTERTAINMENT HAS A POOR SELECTION OF APP APPS AND CONTROLS ARE COMPLICATED
THE ENTERING OF ADDRESSES SHOULD BE EASIER IT REQUIRES TO BE VERY PRECISE AND DOES AN INADEQUATE JOB OF SUGGESTING ALTERNATIVES
WAS REAL DISAPPOINTED WHEN I REALIZED I COULD ONLY LOAD 1 CD AT A TIME
BEING A MUSIC PRODUCER I SOMETIMES USE MY VEHICLE TO GET THE OVERALL SOUND QUALITY OF MY MIXES I CANNOT DO THIS WITH THE DODGE CARAVAN
IT SHOULD HAVE HAD A CD PLAYER BUILT IN THE RADIO
AUDIO SPEAKER PHONE IS NOT GREAT AMD VOICE RECOGNITION FOR OPERATION IS WEAK
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FULLY LOADED VEHICLE BUT IT DOESNT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO SYNC PAIR MY CELL PHONE IT SAID BLUETOOTH CAPATABLE BUT I WAS TOLD THATS THE SATILITE RADIO THIS IS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME WHEN IT COMES TO THIS SECTION OF MY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM ACCURACY BLUETOOTH ALSO RESPONDS POORLY TO VOICE COMMANDS GETTING THEM WRONG OVER HALF THE TIME
THE INFORMATION SCREEN IN THE CENTER OF THE DASH IS TO SMALL TO READ BECAUSE THE LETTERING IDENTIFYING EACH SCREEN ARE VERY SMALL AND HARD TO SEE
ABILITY TO SELECT PRESETS WITH STEERING WHEEL CONTROL
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT GOOD
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS MOST DIFFICULT TO USE OF ALL OF THE FEATURES IN THE VEHICLE SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE TO DO MORE WORK TO GET WHAT YOU NEED THAN IN MOST SYSTEMS
AGAIN MOST OF THE FEATURES ARE COMMONLY AVAILABLE AND THERE IS NOTHING APPEALING TO SAY SO VIDEO FEATURE FOR 2ND AND 3RD ROW IS GOOD BUT RARELY USED AFTER USING SOME OF THE BEST AUDIO SYSTEMS EARLIER I FEEL I AM MISSING A LOT ON MEDIA SIDE
THERE IS NO NAVIGATION
I DON T CARE FOR THE NEW GARMIN GPS IN THE VEHICLE I PREFERRED THE KIND OF GPS THAT WAS IN MY MODEL
CONNECTIVITY TO BLUETOOTH NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
IT WOULD OF BEEN NICE TO RECEIVE 4 WIRELESS HEADPHONES WITH THE VEHICLE INSTEAD OF 2 BECAUSE LETS FACE IT MOST MINIVAN OWNERS HAVE A LEAST 2 CHILDREN AND MANY WITH MORE WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE ENOUGH OF THE HEADPHONES FOR ALL THE KIDS AND THEIR F
AUTOMATIC CONNECTION TO SMARTPHONE AFTER INITIAL PAIRING AND PRIORITY SETTING PAIRED SMARTPHONE MUST BE MANUALLY PAIRED EACH TIME SMARTPHONE IS IN THE VEHICLE
TOO COMPLICATED TO PAIR PHONES SET UP VOICE COMMAND OR USE ANY OTHER DEVICE WHILE DRIVING THE CONSOLE IS FLAT IE DOESN T FACE THE DRIVER SO SEEING WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS DIFFICULT
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE DVD SYSTEM AND MY VEHICLE DOESN T HAVE THAT OPTION
VEHICLE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH FREQUENTLY DROPS CALLS FROM MY IPHONE
I WAS TOLD THAT WHEN I SPOKE USING HANDSFREE IT IS HEARD VERY LOUD ON THE OTHER END
WHEN ANY DEVICE IS HOOKED UP WHETHER ITS THROUGH BLUETOOTH OR USB I WISHED THE SOUND QUALITY WAS THE SAME AS WHEN I PLAY THE RADIO OR SATELLITE RADIO SOUND QUALITY IS COMPROMISED WHEN USING THE FEATURE
THERE IS NO USB PORT FOR PLAYING MUSIC
I REALLY LIKE THE UCONNECT SYSTEM FEATURE I ONLY USE THE AUDIO SYSTEM THOUGH I VE NEVER USED THE COMMUNICATION OR NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN THE CAR
BRING BACK THE DISK PLAYER FOR DVD A DTS CD AND OTHER HIGHER QUALITY AUDIO SOURCES REPLACE THE SATELLITE HEAD UNIT WITH A BETTER MODEL SAME FOR TERRESTRIAL RADIO MOVE THE SUBWOOFERS FROM THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT INTO THE TRUNK AS IN PREVIOUS Y
MORE FLEXIBLE AND BETTER VOICE COMMAND RECOGNITION
SPEAKER QUALITY BRINGS THIS NUMBER DOWN AS WELL AS THE HANDS FREE NAVIGATION WORKING PROPERLY WHILE DRIVING
THE PREMIUM BEATS AUDIO SPEAKERS HAVE POOR SOUND QUALITY I HAD BETTER SOUNDING AUDIO IN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE THAT WAS HALF THE PRICE
NEEDS A DVD PLAYER
SPEAKER AND SOUND QUALITY IS VERY VERY AVERAGE
I WOULD HAVE PROVIDED A HIGHER RATING IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE ISSUES WITH RUNNING MY DEVISES IPOD IPHONE I ALSO WOULD ALSO PREFER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO ALLOW CHANGES WHILE YOU WERE DRIVING IF THE CAR COULD NOTICE THAT SOMEONE IS IN THE PASSE
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO VOICE RECOGNITION EASIER ALSO SOMETIMES CAN T HEAR MY BLUETOOTH PHONE TEXT MESSAGE OR OTHER ALTERS IF I AM NOT ACTIVELY IN THE PHONE MODE
A CD PLAYER GOT MANY CDS NOW HAVE PUT ON SD CARD TO LISTEN 2 THEM WHY  THE 14S HAD CD PLAYER
THERE IS NO COMPANION APP FOR WINDOWS PHONE SO I CAN T USE PANDORA AND SEVERAL OTHER APPS IN MY VEHICLE DASHBOARD
THE SYSTEM IS VERY SLOW WHEN SWITCHING THROUGH SCREENS ESPECIALLY THE IPOD PLAYLISTS THE SYSTEM TENDED TO GUESS AT ADDRESSES WHEN TYPING THEM IN MANUALLY RANDOMLY LEADING ME TO GO BACK OFTEN AND FIX THE STREET ADDRESS
FOR SPENDING SO MUCH YOU WOULD THINK BETTER SPEAKERS AND A BIGGER SCREEN AGAIN FOR $27 000 FROM ANYONE ELSE AND EVERYTHING IS TOUCH SCREEN AND HEATED
MAKE THE APPS RUN FASTER AND VOLUME LEVEL OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS LOW COMPARED TO MY PREVIOUS SRT CHALLENGER I OWNED
THE UCONNECT APP WHEN CONNECTING VIA BLUETOOTH DOES NOT ALWAYS CONNECT SEEMS A BATTLE TO GET IT WORKING EACH TIME I START THE CAR ALSO ONE SWITCHING BETWEEN APPLICATIONS THERE IS A NOTICEABLE LAG
IT WAS TOO SOON TO DO AWAY WITH THE CD PLAYER VERY DISAPPOINTED
I LOVE THE AUDIO & COMMUNICATION BUT THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT
NAVIGATION IS PRETTY CUMBERSOME TO USE IT S NOT A VERY FAST PROCESS THE DELAY IN BETWEEN ENTERING NUMBERS AND LETTERS IS ANNOYING
IT WAS DISAPPOINTING THAT THERE WAS NOT AN OPTION FOR A CD PLAYER IN THIS MODEL
DIDN T NOTICE UNTIL AFTER THE PURCHASE THAT THE VEHICLE DIDN T HAVE A CD PLAYER I DON T USE AN IPOD OR OTHER PLUG IN MUSIC DEVICE SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HANDY
ANOTHER USB PORT CD PLAYER
ACCESSING WIFI CONNECTIVITY WAS DIFFICULT BUT CALL CENTER WAS VERY HELPFUL IN GUIDING ME THROUGH THE PROCESS
DIFFICULT FOR OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND ME WHEN SPEAKING USING THE HANDS FREE SYSTEM
IT SHOULD HAVE A BETTER EQUALIZER
VOICE RECOGNITION IT S NOT GOOD
VOICE RECOGNITION COULD BE IMPROVED WITH A LEARNING ABILITY THIS WAY I COULD SAY CALL MOM AND IT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY DIAL THE RIGHT PERSON COMPARED TO HAVING TO SAY DIAL NAME OF PERSON AND PHONE LINE TO CALL IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE TO HAVE A AUTO
LOVE THE TOUCHSCREEN WISH THE SCREEN WAS BIGGER
BETTER BLUETOOTH FUNCTIONALITY
BEATS SPEAKERS ARE GOOD BUT NOT THE BEST COULD IMPROVE THE SOUND SYSTEM WITH BETTER SPEAKERS BEATS SPEAKERS ARE GOOD SMALL WIRELESS SPEAKERS BUT THE QUALITY OF THE CAR SPEAKERS COULD BE IMPROVED
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY ZOOM IN AND OUT OF THE MAP BUT TO BE ABLE TO SLIDE IT OVER TO CHECK TRAFFIC FURTHER ALONG MY ROUTE I ALSO DISLIKE THAT SOMETIMES AFTER I PULL OUT OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD MY NAV SYSTEM ASSUMES IT KNOWS WHERE I AM G
GO BACK TO OLD WAY OF READING MAP ROTATE SCREEN
TRAFFIC AND GUIDANCE ON MY SMART PHONE IS SUPERIOR TO THE IN CAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM DURING MY DAILY COMMUTE
SOMETIMES THE SYSTEM CANNOT PICK UP WHERE IT LEFT OFF ON AN IPOD IPHONE PLAYLIST THIS IS FRUSTRATING AT TIMES THE WAY AROUND IT IS TO PLAY THE SONG FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS PAUSE IT AND THEN PLUG IT IN TO THE CAR MAKING SURE THAT THE CONSO
VOICE RECOGNITION OF NAMES IN THE PHONE ADDRESSS BOOK AND NAMES OF STREETS FOR NAVIGATION
VOICE COMMAND HAS A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING COMMANDS WHEN INPUTTING PLACES AND ADDRESSES TO NAVIGATE TO ALSO I AM NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO CONNECT SONGZA TO LISTEN TO

THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT PICK UP MY VOICE AT ALL WHICH IS FRUSTRATING AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WAS CONFUSING AT FIRST
MY CALLS GET DROPPED SOMETIMES WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH FEATURE
REALLY MISS THE HARD DRIVE BECAUSE THE FLASH DRIVE IS SO HARD TO INSTALL
THE BLUETOOTH ASPECT OF IT IS NOT GREAT PEOPLE I TALK TO SAY THEY CAN BARLY UNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TALK
UNABLE TO GET A DEALER INSTALLED CD PLAYER HAVE TO PLUG IN A CD PLAYER TO THE AUDIO INPUT JACK DIFFICULT TO MANUALLY CONTROL THE CD PLAYER WHILE DRIVING PLAYER IS NOT ABLE TO INTERFACE WITH THE DASHBOARD CONTROLS HAVE THE FACTORY CD PLAYER INST
THE VOICE RECOGNITION WITH MAKING PHONE CALLS ISN T ALWAYS ACCURATE SOMETIMES IT TAKE 3 TIMES OR MORE FOR THE SYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE WHO I WANT TO CALL
THE MAP POINTS OF INTETEST SND DRIVING DIRECTIONS HAVE SENT US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION MANY TIMES WE USE OUR PHONE FOR DIRECTIONS MUCH MORE RELIABLE
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE STANDARD IN A 39 000 OO VEHICLE AS WELL AS WIFI CHEVY PROVIDES IT
BETTER CONNECTIVITY
BE ABLE TO REPLY TO TEXT MESSAGES HANDS FREE WITH IPHONES
THE NAV SYSTEM IS A PAIN IN THE ASS NOT ONE TENTH THE USEABILITY OF MY GARMIN NUVI 3790T IT IS WAY OVER COMPLICATED AND OF COURSE NOT USABLE WHILE MOVING GET THE GD BOOK OUT AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW AND WHY THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS REAL NICE
UCONNECT COULD BE EASIER TO USE ALL ASPECTS OF
NAV ALWAYS HAVE NUMBERS AND LETTERS ON NOT JUST WHAT IS POSSIBLE SPELLING OR ADDRESS
CD PLAYER WOULD BE NICE
ALLOW THE KEYBOARD FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING THE PASSENGER CAN TYPE THEN YOU DON T HAVE TO STOP
NO APP FOR WINDOWS PHONE
MAKE THE CONNECTION FOR THE IPOD IN A MORE ACCESSIBLE PLACE
SECOND ROW DVD PLAYER
USB CONTROLS
MORE USB PORTS
MAKE UPGRADING THE SOFTWARE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM EASIER
NAVIGATION IS TERRIBLE WE SWITCHED TO GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE AND USE THE PHONE INSTEAD WISH WE COULD CONNECT GOOGLE MAPS TO OUR NAV SYSTEM CHRYSLER SHOULD LOOK INTO PARTNERING WITH GOOGLE FOR THEIR NAV SYSTEM THIS WOULD BE A HUGE COUP FOR CHR
BETTER COMPATIBILITY WITH ALL BRANDS OF PHONES I SHOULD BE ABLE TO COMPOSE TEXTS AS WELL AS HAVE THEM READ WITH ANY PHONE IT SHOULD BE MADE SO THAT ONE NEVER HAS TO PICK UP A PHONE WHILE IN THE CAR ALL VOICE COMMANDS AND BETTER RECOGNITIO
VOLUME AND TREBLE CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE WHEN USING SD CARD OR USB EVEN WITH THE LESS OR MORE CONTROLS NOT SURE WHY THIS IS THE NAVIGATION POI DOES NOT HAVE A REST AREA LOCATOR OPTION
SOUND QUALITY COULD BE IMPROVED
NO ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM NO CD PLAYER
TOO MUCH STUFF ON BACKSIDE OF STEERING WHEEL AUDIO CONTROLS SHOULD BE ON FRONT LESSER USED THINGS SHOULD BE ON BACK OF WHEEL IF SOMETHING HAS TO BE BACK THERE
SEE PREVIOUS COMMENTS CONCERNING NAVIGATION SYSTEM
AN EASIER AND MORE ACCURATE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WOULD BE WONDERFUL
I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH VOICE RECOGNITION BUT REALLY HAVE NO COMPLAINTS
DON T HAVE NAVIGATION THAT S WHAT I CAN T UNDERSTAND
HANDS FREE OPTIONS
THE SOUND WHILE USING THE HANDS FREE PHONE MY WIFE DOES NOT WANT ME USING IT WHEN CALLING HER BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO BAD
SIMPLIFY IT TAKES TO MANY STEPS TO SEND A TEXT SOMETIMES THE IPOD DOESN T REGISTER YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY LOOK AT THE SCREEN TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN TAKING YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD VOICE ACTIVATION IS A PITA TO REMEMBER HOW TO SAY EVERYTHING
MY TRUCK IS THE BASE MODEL I ASSUMEAND UPGRADED MODEL WILL HAVE THE FEATURES I E BLUETOOTH PANDORA RADIO THANK YOU
NAVAGATION VOLUME IN CONJUNCTION WITH RADIO PLAYING
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT GREAT HAVE TO REPEAT COMMAND A LOT
ISSUES GETTING PHONE TO CONNECT FOR CALLS IPHONE 6

THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM HAS YET TO PLACE A CALL COMMAND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM LACK THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY PLACES BY BUSINESS NAME SUCH AS TRADER JOES ANN ARBOR MICHIGAN EITHER SCROLLING THROUGH MULTIPLE LISTS OR LOOKING UP A STREET AD
COULD HAVE VOICE CONTROLS
THE USB PORT DID NOT RECOGNIZE MY MP3 PLAYER SO I HAD TO USE A STANDARD AUDIO CABLE TO CONNECT IT IT DOES NOT WORK AS SMOOTHLY BECAUSE WITHOUT THE USB CONNECTION I CAN NOT FORWARD SONGS WITH THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
I WAS PROMISED THE SIRUS RADIO BEFORE I BOUGHT MY DODGE JOURNEY AND WHEN I GOT IT HOME I COULD NOT EVER FIND IT I HAVE THE DODGE JOURNEY SE DO I OR DON T I HAVE THIS FEATURE BECAUSE I AM SURE I WOULD ENJOY IT PLEASE RESPOND  ALSO DON T I G

BRING THE MICROPHONE CLOSE TO THE DRIVER S FACE
WHEN PHONE CALLS COME IN THE SPEAKERS ARE A LITTLE SCRATCHY
BETTER SPEAKER MICROPHONE QUALITY FOR HANDS FREE DRIVING
RADIO AND SPEAKERS ARE AWESOME NAVIGATION SYSTEM WORKS FINE ITS GREAT THAT ITS NOT A PAY SYSTEM LIKE ONSTAR IT WAS A LITTLE BIT TRICKY LEARNING HOW TO NAVIGATE AROUND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT
I WOULD LIKE MY PASSENGER TO BE ABLE TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE I AM DRIVING THE SYSTEM WILL NOT ALLOW THIS AT THIS TIME
THE BASIC MODEL COULD BE IMPROVED BY COMING STANDARD WITH BLUETOOTH OR VOICE ACTIVATED CONTROLS
I DO NOT LIKE IT WHEN THE RADIO GOES OFF AND THERE IS NO TIME SHOWING OR BACK UP SCREEN
AN INTEGRATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM WITH A TOUCHSCREEN RADIO SYSTEM
CANNOT FAST FORWARD THROUGH MP3 TRACK USEFUL FOR AUDIO BOOKS CANNOT ADJUST VOLUME DURING PHONE CALLS
BLUETOOTH CONNECTION TO PHONE IS NOT AS STRONG AS EXPECTED
A2DP AUDIO PROFILE AND ANDROID USB SUPPORT WOULD BUMP MY RATING UP TO 9 OR 10
NOT EVEN SURE HOW TO COMPLETELY USE IT NOR DO I BELIEVE IT HAS A NAVIGATION SYSTEM I M STILL LEARNING IT S NOT CAPABLE OF SIRIUS XM
BY HAVING A BUILT IN NAVIGATION SYSTEM
ENTERING ADDRESSES IN GPS
I WOULD LIKE A HIGHER QUALITY SOUND SYSTEM BUT I DID NOT GO WITH THE PREMIUM AUDIO PACKAGE I ALSO WISH THE USB PORT WERE EASIER TO ACCESS AND THAT THE SYSTEM WOULD RETURN TO THE SAME TRACK ON THE FLASH DRIVE AFTER SWITCHING BETWEEN MEDIA
PHONE HANDS FREE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND AND THE SALESMAN DID NOT SET IT UP FOR ME
EXTERNAL NAVIGATION IS TOO BIG & BULKY AND BLOCKS MY FIELD OF VIEW WHILE DRIVING SO I NEVER USE IT
SOUND QUALITY OF AM STATIONS
PHONE CALLS COMING IN SHOULD PLAY ON THE CAR SPEAKER AND MIC SHOULD PICK UP THE DRIVER THEN FEED IT BACK IN CALLS NOW SOUND DISTANT AND REMOTE LEADING DRIVER TO DISCONNECT THE HANDS FREE SERVICE
VOICE COMMANDS ARE FAR TOO AWKWARD TO USE SPEAK AND WAIT IS A REAL NUISANCE
USEFULNESS OF CONTROL BUTTONS ON AUDIO SYSTEM SOME DO NOT APPLY TO MY VEHICLE
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I COULD CONNECT DIRECTLY WITH SIRI
VOICE RECOGNITION IS LIMITED IN FEATURES I WISH I HAD MORE CONTROL OVER EXTERNAL MUSIC PLAYER VIA BLUETOOTH IT MAY JUST BE I NEED TO READ THE MANUAL MORE CLOSELY
NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM AVAILABLE A MUST BY TODAYS STANDARDS
THERE COULD BE BETTER OVERAL QUALITY OF THE SYSTEM YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR A SERVICE THAT USES CELL TO GET DIRECTIONS IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE TECH PACKAGE INSTALLED IT IS A VERY PORE DESIGN I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO MAKE MONEY BUT WHEN YOU PAY 25K FO
MENU DESCRIPTION WHEN VOICE TEXTING IS CUMBERSOME VOICE READ BACK OF TEXTS IS VERY RUDIMENTARY COMPARED TO OTHER CURRENT ELECTRONIC DEVICES
I HAVE NO CD PLAYER DIDN T FIND THAT OUT UNTIL AFTER THE PURCHASE OF MY TRUCK
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT THE GREATEST
BLUETOOTH SUCKS AND THE USB PLUG SUCKS
THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS AND ARE NOT INTUITIVE OR EASY TO USE
I THINK MY PHONE IS OLDER IPHONE 4 AND WON T CONNECT PROPERLY
HEADS UP DISPLAY WOULD BE SAFER
STYLING AND EASE OF USE I KNOW IT SAYS TO CHOOSE ONLY ONE BUT IT IS A DEADLOCK TIE THE STYLING IS MEDIOCRE AND I STILL CAN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE PANDORA OTHER THAN USING IT FROM MY PHONE NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY
I HAVE NOT USED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM YET
VOICE RECOGNITION WHEN ATTEMPTING TO USE MY CONNECTED IPHONE SEAMS WEEK INACCURATE
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PHONE
NAVIGATING THROUGH THE SIRIUS STATIONS IS A HASSLE NOT THAT I WOULD HAVE IT IF IT WEREN T ON A YEAR LONG FREE DEMO
NAVIGATION GUIDANCE WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY INFORM YOU OF THE TURN OR EXIT TO TAKE WAY AHEAD OF THE TURN OR EXIT & NOT WAIT TILL YOU RE 100 TO 300 FEET BEFORE YOU TAKE THE TURN
VOLUME LEVEL FROM AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE LOUDER
VOICE COMMAND ISNT RECEPTIVE
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CD PLAYER IN CAR DO NOT USE PHONE OR IPOD FOR MUSIC OR TALK ON THE PHONE
BLUETOOTH PHONE VOICE RECOGNITION IS TERRIBLE NEVER UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU SAY
WISH IT HAD TURN SIGNALS ON MIRRORS AND LANE CHANGING WARNING BACKUP SYSTEM IS NOT REAL GOOD IN RAIN ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT
THERE IS NO OFF CONTROL FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE AN ANGLE WITH FORCING OWNERS TO LISTEN
HARDER THAN OTHER SYSTEMS TO GO THROUGH SATELLITE STATIONS
TOO COMPLICATED HAVEN T HAD TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT MAKE A DVD TO SHOW HOW
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO WORK THE DVD PLAYER
NAVIGATION SCREEN COULD BE BIGGER
CONNECTING PHONE IN AN EASIER MATTER WE CONNECT IT VIA BLUETOOTH BUT SOMETHING IS JUST NOT RIGHT
JUST THE UNDERSTANDING OF IT ALL CAN YOU PLAY A MOVIE AND HAVE THE HEAD PHONES AND ALSO LISTEN TO THE RADIO
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE EASIER TO USE
BE ABLE TO TURN ON A PASSENGER MODE FOR NAVIGATION WHILE MOVING TO BE ABLE TO ENTER INFO AND AFTER NAVIGATION WHILE MOVING
WOULD HAVE LIKED A CD PLAYER IN THE CAR
I DONT GAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN MY CAR
CAN T GET THE BLUETOOTHTO WORK DON T HAVE ANY OTHER DEVICES IPAOD MP3 PLAYER SO WOULDN T EVEN KNOW HOW TO CONNECT OR USE THOSE
SPEAKERS ARE WEAK NAVIGATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO PROVIDE MORE OPTIONS FOR THE GUIDED ROUTE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IF NOISE IN THE BACKGROUND IT WILL KEEP MAKING YOU REPEAT IT BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
I LIKE HOW BIG THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS
AUDIO QUALITY ON HANDS FREE PHONE CALLS SEEMS EXTREMELY VARIABLE AT TIMES IT SEEMS TO WORK WELL AND AT OTHER TIMES IT IS PRETTY MUCH USELESS BECAUSE THE AUDIO QUALITY IS SO VARIABLE I AM SURE THIS HAS AT LEAST SOMETHING TO DO WITH INSTANTANEOU
LOCATIONOF USB PORTS LONG THUMB DRIVE COULD BE BROKEN
SYNC WITH MYFORD TOUCH DOESN T SUPPORT APP LINK IS NOT ABLE TO USE VOICE DICTATION TO RESPOND TO TEXT MESSAGES AND GETTING IT TO READ A TEXT MESSAGES IS NOT QUICK OR USER FRIENDLY WITHOUT TOUCHING THE SCREEN IF IT DETECTS A MESSAGE IT STORES IT
DIFFICULTY WITH UNDERSTANDING EACH OTHER WHEN INPUTTING ADDRESSES
MAP IS POOR FOR WEATHER
RECOGNITION OF VOICE COMMANDS BY THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
DIRECT ACCESS TO THE MOBILE PHONE AS OPPOSED TO GOING THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY INTEGRATION WITH SYNC I M ACCUSTOMED TO HOW MY PHONE WORKS AND IT WORKS WELL I THEREFORE DON T THINK I NEED TO GO THROUGH AND LEARN ANOTHER SYSTEM TO USE THE FEATURES
BETTER WINDOWS PHONE SUPPORT
ELIMINATE SIRIUS ALL TOGETHER OR MAKE IT AN OPTION
I USE A FLASH DRIVE IN THE USB PORT FOR ALL MY MUSIC THAT I HAVE DOWN LOADED ONTO IT IT IS VERY CUMBERSOME TO USE EVERY TIME A CD HAS FINISHED PLAYING I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS OF BROWSING AND THEN MUSIC TO GET TO THE ALBUMS
EASE OF USE OF NAVIGATION INTERFACE COULD BE IMPROVED
DO NOT LIKE MY RADIO CONTROLS
JUST THE ONE ISSUE I HAVE WITH THE SPEAKERS WHEN USING MY IPHONE
YOU NEED TO IMPROVE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM AND SYNC VOICE COMMANDS SERIOUS ISSUE CONNECTING TO SYNCE DEVICES ARE AN ISSUE
SOUND QUALITY
I HAVE A WINDOWS PHONE AND THE NAV IS MICROSOFT SYNC YET TEXT MESSAGING DOES NOT WORK

AUDIO SPEAKERS COULD BE IMPROVED ESPECIALLY AROUND THE SUB AREA PANDORA APP INSTALLED ON ENTERTAINMENT WOULD BE A PLUS AS WELL
IT IS ALL ON THE NAV SCREEN WHICH CAN BE HARD TO SEE UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE EVERYTHING IS
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ALLOW A PASSENGER TO ENTER IN ADDRESS DATA WHILE MOVING MANY TIMES I FIND MYSELF ALREADY ON THE FREEWAY WITH A PASSENGER AND THE SYSTEM WILL NOT ALLOW US TO ENTER THE DESTINATION TREAT US LIKE ADULTS
I WISH IT HAD HANDS FREE PHONE
A FREE TRIAL OF SYNC SERVICES WOULD GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY ALL OF MY CARS FEATURES I HAVE NO CLUE HOW MY CARS NAVIGATION SYSTEM WORKS BECAUSE ITS A $60 FEE TO TURN IT ON
AS STATED BEFORE THE SAT RADIO IS USELESS WHEN I USED MY CAB OVER CAMPER DEALER SAYS THEY HAVE NO FIX TAKE IF TO SOME ONE ELSE NOT REAL HAPPY ABOUT THAT I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IF THEY SELL YOU A SAT RADIO AND YOU D LIKE TO TAKE A TRIP WIT
I HAVE THE PREMIUM SOUND BUT NO EXTERNAL SEPARATE SUBWOOFER I THINK EVERY VEHICLE NEEDS ONE THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS IS JUST OKAY THEY COULD REALLY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE SPEAKERS
MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE SIMPLE ON WORKING THROUGH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
A LITTLE TRICKY TO NAVIGATE MENUS AT FIRST BUT ONCE IT S FIGURED OUT NOT TOO BAD
NOT ABLE TO GET SATELLITE RADIO WITH THE ECOBOOST PACKAGE
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVEMENT CAR SALESMEN CLEARLY PRACTICE AND KNOW WHICH PHRASES TO USE TO MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK
THE MIC QUALITY FOR BLUTOOTH PHONE CALLS
MEDIA SYSTEM IS SLOW TO SWITCH BETWEEN DIFFERENT OPTIONS E G RADIO TO BLUETOOTH
THE LEGENDS FOR THE AUDIO SYSTEM ARE DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH
I ESPECIALLY ENJOY MY CELL PHONE SERVICE NO HANDS ANSWERING ON THE STEERING WHEAL AND THE SOUND IS ESPECIALLY GOOD I DON T HAVE ENTERTAINMENT COMMUNICATION NOR NAVIGATION SYSTEMS
VOICE COMMANDS ARE VERY STRICT IN THEIR INPUT UNLIKE MY PHONE WHICH ACCEPTS SLANG QUESTIONS FROM MULTIPLE ANGLES AND HAS A VERY LARGE VOCABULARY SYSTEM WORKS FLAWLESSLY WHEN I BOTHER TO USE IT PREFER MY PHONE IN ALL INSTANCES
VOICE RECOGNITION IS POOR BUT BETTER THAN PAST 2 FORDS FOCUS & FUSION
THE SYNC SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE IT HAS AGGRAVATING PROBLEMS WHEN COMMUNICATING WITH AN IPHONE VIA USB AND ALWAYS DEFAULTS TO FM RADIO IF THE USB IS DISCONNECTED WHICH HAPPENS ALL THE TIME BECAUSE IT S MY PHONE THERE IS NO WAY TO SET THE DEFAULT TO
THE SYNC TOUCH INTERFACE IS TOO CLUNKY
EVERYTHING IS QUITE EASY TO USE FOR PASSENGER BUT NOT FOR DRIVER MUCH TOO DISTRACTING FOR DRIVER BUT ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM FOR NEARLY 3000 MILE TRIP
IT SEEMS ALL BLUETOOTH CAR SYSTEMS HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH GOOD SOUND LOTS OF BACKGROUND NOISE HEARD WIND ETC EASIER PUSH CONTROLS
I CANNOT CONNECT MY TABLET TO SYNC
WOULD BE NICE IF THE CAR HAD THE NEW SYNC AND NOT THE CRAPPY OLD MICROSOFT VERSION
TOUCH SCREEN CONTROL IS SLOW TO LOAD SATELLITE RADIO MENU NOT EASY TO NAVIGATE THE AUDIO CONTROLS LOTS OF TRIAL AND ERROR TO FIGURE IT OUT
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PHONE CALLS
A WAY ON THE STEERING WILL TO FLIP MODES OF LISTENING I E FM TO AM TO SATELLITE RADIO HAVE A WAY TO SWITCH BETWEEN THEM WITH A BUTTON ON THE STEERING WHEEL
LOSING CALLS DURING PHONE CALLS
SPEAKERS ARE CHEAP I HAVE THE S MODEL WITH NO SATELLITE RADIO AND I WAS UPSET ABOUT THAT
ALL I USE IS AM FM AND CD
MORE CONTROL OF THE SOUND QUALITY
THE TOUCHSCREEN USER INTERFACE IS HARD TO USE WHEN DRIVING
FORDS SYNC IS VERY GOOD WITH VOICE RECOGNITION AND CONTROLLING MY PHONE IPOD THE TOUCHSCREEN IN THE CAR SEEMS TO BE VERY MENU BASED AND DIFFICULT IF YOU RE NOT GREAT WITH ELECTRONICS IVE HAD IT IN 2 CARS NOW AND CAN USE IT VERY WELL AND VERY PL
WILL TAKE INPUT FROM ANDROID DEVICES BUT NOT NEARLY AS WELL AS IT SHOULD
THE RESPONSE OF THE SYSTEM IS SLOWER THAN I PREFER IN THE NAVIGATION THERE ARE TWO CONFIRMATION STEPS WHEN SELECTING A DESTINATION FOR EXAMPLE IF I CHOOSE MY HOME I SHOULDN T HAVE TO SELECT IT AGAIN
SOMETIMES THE VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE COMMANDS GIVEN
THE SYNC SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED SEE OTHER COMMENTS IN SURVEY REGARDING THIS
VOICE COMMAND COULD BE EASIER TO USE
THE QUALITY OF CALLS VOLUME WHEN USING HANDS FREE CONNECTION
SOUND QUALITY AND MISUNDERSTANDING OF DIRECTIONS
I WISH THAT IT WOULD HAVE CAME EQUIPPED WITH NAVIGATION SIRIUS XM AND AN AMPLIFIER FOR MORE BASS AND POWER
VOICE RECOGNITION HAS SOMETIMES FAILED
VOICE RECOGNITION NAVIGATION SYSTEM ACCURACY
WE HAVEN T YET USED ANY OTHER DEVICES THAN THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
HAVE PROBLEMS USING THE MY FORD TOUCH SCREEN FOR RADIO
NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MORE DIRECT
VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT THE BEST HAVE TO REPEAT COMMANDS
HOW TO CONNECT IPOD PHONE TAB ETC CAN NOT GET IT DONE
LIKE HAVING HANDS FREE CALLING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOESN T WORK RIGHT
AS WITH MOST VEHICLES I VE ENCOUNTERED VOICE RECOGNITION
THE STEERING WHEEL BUTTONS DO NOT HAVE A SEEK FEATURE FOR THE RADIO WHAT THE HELL ELSE SHOULD BE ON THE STEERING WHEEL BESIDES A SEEK BUTTON GM LETS YOU SEEK UP AND DOWN THE RADIO STATIONS THE CENTER BUTTON THAT SELECTS THE SOURCE IS TOO EAS
THE CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WITH THE BLUETOOTH HAS OCCURRED MANY TIMES FOR ME
MENU FOR NAVIGATION DEVICE SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE AND PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION
JUST MAKE IT EASIER TO USE THE TOUCH SCREEN
VOICE CONTROL AND RECOGNITION COULD B BETTER SOMETIMES IT DOESN T RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU SAY IF YOU SPEAK TO QUICKLY OR DON T ENUNCEIATE
VOICE CONTROL FOR PLAYING MUSIC FROM USB CONNECTED IPHONE IS ALMOST UNUSABLE AND EVEN WORSE THAN IN PREVIOUS GENERATION
NEEDS TO INTEGRATE SIRI AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO COMPOSE TEXT MESSAGES ALSO WOULD BE NICE IF PROFILE PICTURES FOR YOUR CONTACTS WAS AVAILABLE
VOICE COMMAND SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERPRET REGULAR SENTENCES INSTEAD OF PRESCRIBED SENTENCES
IT IS MOUNTED LOWER THAN I WOULD LIKE TOO MUCH TIME LOOKING AWAY FROM THE ROAD THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ARE GREAT THOUGH
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION AND QUICKER RESPONSE AFTER COMMAND HAS BEEN GIVEN
I AM NOT ABLE TO COMMENT ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS I HAVEN T USED IT YET
HAVE TO REPEAT WHEN USING HANDS FREE TO BE UNDERSTOOD ALSO THE PHONE CONNECTION NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO USE ANY CELL PHONE
IT IS A SLOW PROCESS TO TYPE THE INFORMATION OF WERE YOU ARE TRYING TO GO IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE I TALK TO WHILE DRIVING AND USING THE HANDS FREE SYSTEM IN THE CAR THEY COMPLAIN SAYING THEIR IS QUITE A BIT OF ECO I DO LIKE THAT YOU CAN NOT A
THIS VEHICLE HAS NO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT OR NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND THE RADIO IS OF POOR SOUND QUAILTY
I USE THE NAVAGATION SYSTEM FOR POINTS OF INTEREST MOST OFTEN IT IS CUMBERSOME TO GO THROUGH A DOZEN STEPS INSTEAD OF SAYING FIND ANY RESTAURANT NEARBY I ALSO HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH ADDRESSES WHICH ARE ON A HIGHWAY I DON T ALWAYS KNOW IF T
NOT SURE WHAT SOME OF THE BUTTONS DO I DON T HAVE THE BLUETOOTH ACTIVATED ON MY PHONE CONNECT AND WHEN I PLUG THE PHONE TO THE USB IT WILL CHARGE BUT I CAN T GET IT TO WORK THROUGH THE AUDIO SYSTEM I CAN ONLY GET THE IPOD TO WORK THROUGH THE
ACCUSTOMED TO STEERING CONTROLS HARD TO ADJUST VOLUME WITHOUT ACCIDENTALLY TURNING ON 4 WAY FLASHER
EASE OF PUTTING DESTINATION INTO NAVIGATION SYSTEM MORE DETAILED ROADS DISPLAYED
THE STATION SELECT BUTTONS R TO SMALL AND CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE SCREEN THE DIAL IS OLD FASHIONED AND SHOULD BE REPLACED WITH A NUMBER PAD VS HAVING TO TURN THE DIAL TO ANNUALLY SELECT RADIO STATIONS CHRYSLER RADIO IN TOWN AND COUNTRY WAS A
IT WOULD BE NICER IF THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM HAD MULTIPLE MONITORS AND ABILITY TO PLAY MULTIPLE DVDS
HOOD OVER TOUCH SCREEN TOO LOW RESULTING IN UPPER PART SOME WHAT OBSCURED I AM 6 2 & SEAT ALL THE WAY DOWN & AFT
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT EASY TO USE I HAVE TRIED TO USE THE NAVIGATION ON MY PHONE BUT CANT GET ANY SOUND TO COME THROUGH THE SPEAKERS
RADIO STATIONS ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT TO GET TO THAT 5 OR 6 BAND OPTION MESSES ME UP NOT CONVENIENT AT ALL
ROUT GUIDANCE AND NAVIGATION INTERFACE IS DIFFICULT TO USE ROUTES ARE OFTEN CONVOLUTED AND TURN ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE OFTEN TOO LATE
I HAVE OCCASIONALLY HAD CONNECTIVITY PROBLEMS WITH STREAMING BLUETOOTH AUDIO FROM MY IPHONE THROUGH THE RADIO SO MAKING THAT TRANSITION MORE SMOOTH WOULD BE APPRECIATED
TOUCH SCREEN MENU TO HARD TO NAVIGATE AND SLOW RESPONSE NAVIGATION HARD TO SEE SCREEN
I DON T USE THE COMMUNICATION OR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IT CAME WITH THE VEHICLE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I DON T KNOW IF I M JUST NOT UNDERSTANDING THE INSTRUCTIONS OR IF THEY ARE TO DIFFICULT
TROUBLE USING VOICE CONTROLS TO MAKE PHONE CALLS
WHEN I AM USING BLUETOOTH TO TALK ON THE TELEPHONE THE OTHER PARTY CAN HARDLY HEAR ME
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE ESPECIALLY INPUTING ADDRESSES I CAN T GET THE HANDS FREE FEATURE TO WORK PROPERLY USER ERROR NORMALLY
THE AUTOMATIC DIMMING FEATURE OF THE MAIN DISPLAY SCREEN SOMETIMES FAILS TO DIM TO THE LEVEL I VE SET
TOO MANY BUTTONS KEEP IT SIMPLE NEED CD OR DVD FOR ALL FEATURES
UNACCEPTABLE LAG TIME FOR TOUCH SCREEN CONTROLS I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU TRY TO MAKE SYNC 3 0 BACKWARD COMPATIBLE FLAC COMPATIBILITY WOULD BE A PLUS AFTER DUMPING MICROSOFT
GARMIN HAS MUCH BETTER SYSTEM EASIER TO USE 75% LESS COSTS AND PORTABLE
LARGER SCREEN OPTION FOR FULL SCREEN NAVIGATION GET RID OF BREAK UP SCREEN WHEN TURNING
PUT IN A CD PLAYER I LISTEN TO BOOKS ON CD AND IN ORDER TO LISTEN TO THEM I HAVE TO DOWNLOAD TO MY MAC AND THEN TRANSFER TO A THUMB DRIVE I HATE THIS ASPECT OF THE TRUCK THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS USELESS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS LESS THAN ADEQUATE ALMOST NEVER RECOGNIZES THE STREET NAMES
BOSE SPEAKERS ARE NOT THAT GREAT SOUND JUST OK
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO USE AND FOLLOW
I HAVE ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM WITH FINDING THE GO BUTTON AFTER A DOWNLOAD OF DIRECTIONS IS SENT TO THE VEHICLE AND NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THE GO BUTTON ON THE SCREEN EVEN ONSTAR
HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE SUCCESS WITH THE VOICE ACTIVATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM PROBABLY COULD USE SOME TRAINING
DATA ENTRY FOR NAV SYSTEM
NAV SUCKS
VOICE RECOGNITION AND FINDING FASTEST ROUTE IN NAVIGATION
VOICE RECOGNITION DOES NOT ALWAYS RECOGNIZE WHAT IS BEING SAID
I HATE THAT YOU HAVE TO USE ON STAR TO GET NAVIGATION YOU HAVE TO CALL THEM WHO DOWNLOADS IT TO THE TRUCK AFTER A 6 MONTH PERIOD YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT IT SHOULD COME WITH THE IT LIKE OTHER COMPANIES DO I REALLY DON T WANT TO PUSH A BUTTON
NEED AVAILABILITY OF MULTI DISK CD PLAYER
NEED HELP ON CONNECTING IPOD DOES NOT APPEAR TO RECOGNIZE IT NEED TO TAKE TO DEALER TO INSURE I AM DOING IT PROPERLY
ACCURACY AND ROUTING PROVIDE BY THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW PUT THE CD RADIO BACK IN
NAVIGATION SHOULD ROUTE THE SHORTEST OR FASTEST ROUTE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO DISPLAY SPEED LIMITS FOR THE ROADS BEING TRAVELED ON
FOR THE COST OF THE NEW VEHICLES THE SYSTEMS SUBSCRIPTIONS SHOULD LAST LONGER SIRIUS RADIO COMPANY ARE ABSOLUTY OFFENSIVE IN THE ATTEMPTS TO RESIGN CUSTOMERS THE MAIL AND PHONE CALLS ARE VERY UNAPPRECIATED I WILL NOT PURCHASE FOR THIS REASON
THE NAV SYSTEM HAS NOT WORKED FOR THE LAST 5 WEEKS NO REPLACEMENT PARTS
VERTICAL SWIPING BETWEEN MULTIPLE CHANNELS ON XM IS DIFFICULT HARD TO GET THE SCROLL ROLLING LIKE I CAN ON MY PHONE
SCREEN COULD BE BIGGER MAP IS SOMETIMES HARD TO READ SEPARATE THE NAVIGATION AND RADIO
I DO LIKE MY AUDIO AND COMMUNICATION ESPECIALLY HANDS FREE FEATURE NOT HAPPY WITH NAVIGATION
CAN T LOCATE USB PORT VOICE COMMAND FEATURE IS USELESS MANUAL CONTROLS ARE COMPLICATED I PAID EXTRA FOR A GOOD SYSTEM BUT I BELIEVE A STANDARD SYSTEM WITH A CD PLAYER AND NO TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY IT APPEARS LITTLE ATTENTION
THE SET UP FOR THE SPEAKERS PAID SEVERAL HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE FOR THE NAV AND SPEAKER SET UP DISAPPOINTED IN THE SOUND QUALITY OF THE BOSE SPEAKERS
I WILL NEVER USE THE ENTERTAINMENT OR NAVIGATION SYSTEMS
MORE ATTRACTIVE MAP DISPLAY
CELL PHONE QUALITY IS AVERAGE TO POOR HOWEVER WE DON T KNOW WHETHER THIS IS A VEHICLE PROBLEM BLUETOOTH OR CELLULAR PROVIDER CREDO MOBILE DEFICIENCY
ONE SMALL THING IS THAT WHEN I USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT IS GREAT THAT IT SWITCHES TO A NIGHT COLOR SCHEME BUT IT DOES IT EVERY TIME I GO UNDER AN OVERPASS WHICH MEANS THAT FOR A FEW MOMENTS THE SCREEN GOES BLANK AS IT GOES BACK AND FORTH BETWE
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF VOICE COMMANDS ALSO THE CAR SHOULD DOUBLE CHECK THAT IT HEARD YOU CORRECTLY BEFORE PLACING A PHONE CALL I HAVE HAD TO SCRAMBLE TO HANG UP ON AN UNINTENDED CALL
INCLUDE WIFI
HANDS FREE SYSTEM DOES NOT UNDERSTAND COMMANDS AND MY PHONE IS BLOCKED BECAUSE MY WIFE S PHONE IS SET AS PRIMARY
TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING VOICE COMMANDS
REDUCING THE SOUND OF OUTSIDE WIND ROAD CONDITIONS WHEN USING YOUR PHONE VIA SYNC MANY PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED OF THE BACKGROUND NOISE WHEN I CALL THEM
VOICE RECOGNITION SPEAKERS NED TO BE UP FURTHER IN THE CEILING NOT BEHIND THE PERSON USING IT ITS UNNATURAL TO HAVE TO RAISE YOUR HEAD BACK TO TALK
BE ABLE TO PUT IN NAVIGATION ADDRESS WHILE DRIVING IF THERE IS A PASSENGER
NEEDS TO SUPPORT USE OF INTERNET APPS LIKE IHEART PANDORA
IPHONE 6 INTERFACE VIA USB COULD BE IMPROVED SO IT DOESN T CAUSE THE OPERATING SYSTEM TO REBOOT
NAVIGATION SOMETIMES HAS PROBLEMS W MY COMMANDS OR MAYBE I AM SAYING THE WRONG THING
IT TAKES SOMETIMES 3 OR 4 TIMES BEFORE PERSON REGISTERS CALLERS NAME WHEN MAKING PHONE CALLS VERY UPSETTING
SIRIUS IN ALL MODELS
SYNC IS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND HEAR CONSTANTLY NEVER HAS THE SAME ISSUE
THE VOICE RECOGNITION RECOGNIZES SOME VOICES BETTER THAN OTHERS IT IS NOT 100% RELIABLE AT RECOGNIZING COMMANDS
CHANGING SATELLITE RADIO CHANNELS IS RIDICULOUSLY HARD I M AFRAID WE WILL BREAK THE BUTTONS BEFORE WE ARE READY TO GET A NEW CAR
DEALER COURSES ON OPERATION OF SYSTEMS PARTICULARLY SYNC
I M USED TO THE NAVIGATION APPS I HAVE ON MY PHONE AND PREFER USING THEM HOWEVER I APPRECIATE THAT I CAN USE THE BLUETOOTH VOICE ACTIVATION THROUGH THE AUDIO COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM
I VE FOUND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM CONFUSING AND WILL NEED TO GO BACK FOR HELP AND DIRECTIONS AS I CANNOT GET IT TO WORK I AM ACTUALLY PRETTY TECH SAVVY BUT AM MISSING ON SOMETHING HERE
DOES NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND VOICE CONTROL TO MANY STEPS
VOICE CONTROL IS MORE GIMMICK THAN TRULY USEFUL NAVIGATING FOLDERS ON FLASH DRIVES IS TEDIOUS
NEED APPLE SOFTWARE
MY ONLY SUGGESTION IS BETTER MAPPING FOR THE NAVI SYSTEM TO ENGAGE WITH OCCASIONALLY WE HAVE BEEN STEERED WRONG AT COMPLEX INTERSECTIONS DISCONCERTING BUT THANKFULLY RARE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT A SMART ONE YOU HAVE TO ENTER THE ADDRESS AND THEN THE CITY AND THEN IT DOESN T WORK TILL YOU VE REENTERED THE ADDRESS AGAIN IT S VERY DUMB AND MAKES YOU GO THROUGH SO MANY STEPS OVER AND OVER AND DOESN T MAKE IT EAS
I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO COMPOSE AND SEND TEXT MESSAGES USING AUDIO COMMANDS
THE DISPLAY IS TINY A LARGER DISPLAY IS NEEDED IDEALLY TOUCHSCREEN
BETTER SPEAKERS AS THERE IS NOT SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH BASS IN THE AUDIO SYSTEM
NOT MANY IMPROVEMENTS TO NOTICE PERHAPS BETTER STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD SELF DIAGNOSE BLUETOOTH PROBLEMS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM MENU SEQUENCE CAN BE TEDIOUS
THE NAV SYSTEM IS VERY POOR I OFTEN USE MY CELL PHONE AND GOOGLE MAPS TO AVOID THE NAV SYSTEMS ISSUES
THE SYSTEM CAN T READ OR CREATE TEXT MESSAGES FROM AN IPHONE IT SEEMS THIS FEATURE IS ONLY FOR ANDROID PHONES SAMSUNG
INSTRUCTIONS ON USE OF VOICE ACTIVATED SERVICES
SEE PREVIOUS COMMENT ABOUT UP TO DATE MAPS
MUCH BETTER INTEGRATION WITH IPHONE AND SIRI
THE USB PORTS AND POWER PLUG AND NAV CARD PORT NEED TO COME OUT OF CENTER CONSOLE TAKES UP ROOM COULD BE PUT ON DASH LIKE SOME FORD CARS AND TRUCKS
NEEDS PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEM
WHEN ENTERING AN ADDRESS THE SYSTEM TRIES TO GUESS WHAT YOU ARE ENTERING WHICH IS VERY ANNOYING THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE SET UP MORE LIKE GARMAN NAVIGATION SYSTEMS SOMETIMES IT WILL NOT LET YOU ENTER AN ADDRESS BECAUSE OF THIS
THE BUTTONS BELOW THE TOUCH SCREEN THAT CONTROL THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM ARE DIFFICULT TO PUSH SOMETIMES YOU CANNOT FIND THE RIGHT TOUCH LOCATION
THE NUMBER OF COMMANDS REQUIRED TO LOCATE ANYTHING IS HIGHLY REDUNDANT IT SHOULD BE NO MORE DIFFICULT TO USE THEN THE MAPPING OR NAVIGATION FEATURES FOUND ON MY SMART PHONE THIS AREA NEEDS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT JUST TO COMPETE WITH A SMART PHONE
NAV IS A BIG IMPROVEMENT FROM BUT NOT PERFECT
WHEN USING NAVIGATION SYSTEM IT DID NOT RECOGNIZE AIRPORT WHEN SEARCHING POINTS OF INTEREST
DON T LIKE TOUCH SCREEN FOR COMPONENT CONTROLS PREFER HARD SWITCHES BUTTONS
COMMUNICATION COULD BE SIMPLER TO USE SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO UNDERSTAND A COMMAND ALSO WISH I COULD USE TOUCH SCREEN WHILE SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT AND SOMEONE ELSE IS DRIVING
I LISTEN TO AUDIO BOOKS WHEN DRIVING MY PREVIOUS EXPEDITION HELD 6 CD S I WOULD LIKE THE TO HOLD MORE THAN ONE AT ON TIME
NO TEXT MESSAGES ON AN IPHONE MICROSOFT SYNC IS AWFUL
MORE ACCURATE NAVIGATION SYSTEM INCLUDING POINTS OF INTEREST
PERSONALLY I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MULTI CD PLAYER BUT I THINK THAT THST IS AN OPTION THAT I DID NOT PURCHASE
WHEN CONNECTING TO BLUETOOTH OR MEDIA INTERFACE CORD THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM CHANGES TO THAT AUDIO OPTION I WOULD LIKE TO USE THE MEDIA CORD FOR CHARGING SOMETIMES AND NOT WANT TO CHANGE JUST BECAUSE I PLUGGED IT IN SAME WITH BLUETOOTH I MAY C
TOUCH SCREEN WOULD MAKE IT MORE USABLE
THE NAVIGATION GUIDANCE IS SOMETIMES DELAYED ON WHERE TO GO OFTEN FIND THAT WHEN IT TELLS ME LATE IN THE ROUTE AND I HAVE TO MAKE A QUICK ADJUSTMENT ON MY ROUTE WHICH IS A SAFETY HAZARD
POI S DOES NOT WORK
ITS CRAZY THAT THERE IS NO AUX INPUT PLAYING MUSIC FROM PHONE IS POSSIBLE ONLY THROUGH BLUETOOTH UNLESS YOU HAVE AN IPHONE DEFINITELY NEEDS TO ADD A AUX INPUT AND PLEASE BE MORE ANDROID COMPATIBLE
HARD TO GET USED TO NAVIGATION AFTER USING GARMIN FOR MANY YEARS
BETTER IF IT WAS A TOUCH SCREEN
THE SETTING OF THE RADIO STATIONS
NAVIGATION SUCKS NOT INTUITIVE HARD TO USE
CHANGING VOLUME OF AM SIGNAL WHEN IT CUTS IN AND OUT OF HD
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE IMPROVED IT IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND ENTER LOCATIONS
EASE OF USE AND BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD DISPLAY THE SPEED LIMITS AND ALARM WHEN OVER SPEED DRIVING
THE NAV SYSTEM IS A PAIN IN THE NECK TO OPERATE
PLEASE UPDATE THE DATED NAVIGATION SYSTEM GRAPHICS AND DIRECTIONS NEED TO BY UPDATED THE 210 FWY COMPLETED 5 YEARS AGO DOES NOT EVEN SHOW UP IN THE UPLAND AREA GIVES POOR SELECTION OF DIRECTIONS SOMETIMES
SOUND ON SATELLITE MUSIC
IF IT WAS NOT FOR VOICE RECOGNITION BEING SO BAD AND AND GPS BEING SLOW IT WOULD BE PERFECT
IT IS ALL ABOUT THE BASS NO SERIOUSLY THE SYSTEM HAS A HARD TIME RECOGNIZING MY VOICE COMMANDS
I D LIKE TO HAVE A TOUCH SCREEN ALSO I CAN T USE THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WHILE DRIVING EVEN IF A PASSENGER IS ENTERING THE INFORMATION I DON T KNOW HOW TO USE THE INTERNET WI FI IN THE CAR AND I M WAITING FOR MERCEDES TO RETURN MY CALL ON THE PAS
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME PRE SET PUSH BUTTONS FOR THE RADIO STATIONS
THE VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM NEEDS IMPROVEMENT IN MY OPINION IT COULD BE MORE INTUITIVE TO USE AND DO A BETTER JOB OF RECOGNIZING VERBAL COMMANDS OR INSTRUCTIONS I USE GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE FOR NAVIGATION DUE TO THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES T
NO RADIO PRESETS ARE EASY TO USE
AS NOTED IN PROBLEMS WITH AUDIO SYSTEM SECTION THE ACCESS TO THE SIX CD CHANGER IS POOR BECAUSE IT IS BLOCKED BY THE CUP HOLDERS AND THE CD CHANGER DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY CYCLE FROM ONE CD TO THE NEXT WHEN A CD IS COMPLETED AFTER USING THE CAR
SEEMLESS CONECTIVITY TO APPLE PRODUCTS IPHONE IPOD ETC
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE MANY ADDRESS THAT OTHER SYSTEMS HAVE
THE SOUND ADJUSTMENTS ON THE HARMON KARDON SYSTEMS ARE SORELY LACKING TREBLE AND BASS IS NOT ENOUGH I WANT AT LEAST A 5 CHANNEL EQUALIZER ON ANY SOUND SYSTEM PREFERABLY EVEN MORE
THE MB SYSTEM IS POORLY INTEGRATED WITH THE IPHONE THE MB SYSTEM WORKS LIKE AN ANTIQUE IT HAS IMPROVED VERY LITTLE IN 15 YEARS THE PROBLEMS SHOULD BE EASY TO FIX SIMPLY UPGRADE THE MB SOFTWARE TO THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE IPHONE ADDRESS BOOK A
OUR GARMIN GPS DISPLAY SHOWS THE CURRENT SPEED LIMIT ON EVERY STRETCH OF HIGHWAY THE BENZ NAV DOES NOT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO HAVE THIS IN THE BENZ
NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT DISPLAY STREETS ROADS PROMINENTLY FONTS USED TO IDENTIFY STREETS ROADS ARE TOO SMALL TO DISTINGUISH WHILE DRIVING
YOU VERY MUCH NEED TO PROVIDE A KEYPAD FOR PHONE DIALING IN ADDITION TO THE TOUCH SCREEN JUST USE A FLIP UP FOR THE TOUCH SCREEN HEAVY PHONE USERS FIND THE TOUCH SCREEN AGONIZINGLY SLOW AND THE VOICE CONTROL NOT ALL THAT CONVENIENT THE NAVI
VOICE NAVIGATION IS HARD TO USE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS LABOR INTENSIVE AND THE OWNER S MANUAL IS NOT HELPFUL IT IS AS CONFUSING AS THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ITSELF
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE A BIT MORE USER FRIENDLY ALSO OPTIONS FOR VOICE CONTROLS COULD BE A BIT MORE EXTENSIVE MY SAMSUNG GALAXY SMART PHONE IS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY FOR GIVING NAVIGATION VOICE COMMANDS I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK INTO THE
DASHBOARD DISPLAY DOESN T SHOW CURRENT SONG TRACK HARD TO FIGURE OUT UPCOMING TURN FROM NAVIGATION SYSTEM BLUETOOTH AUDIO CAN REQUIRE CONVOLUTED STEPS TO RE START
MONOCHROME DISPLAY MAKES IT DIFFICULT AT A GLANCE TO IDENTIFY WHAT MODE YOU ARE IN AND TO NAVIGATE AMONG
FM HD SIGNAL NEEDS IMPROVING HD RADIO DOESN T WORK HALF OF THE TIME I WAS EXPECTING MORE OUT OF THE AUDIO SPEAKERS TOGGLE BUTTON NEAR THE ARM REST IS IN A BAD LOCATION I ACCIDENTALLY SWITCH SONGS BY BUMPING IT WITH MY ELBOW
MY PORSCHE HAS TOUCH SCREEN ON ITS NAV ENTERTAINMENT SYSTMEAND IS THEREFORE MUCH EASIER TO USE
WHEN LISTENING TO AN IPOD AUDIBLE BOOK I AM UNABLE TO GO BACKWARD OR FAST FORWARD
IMPROVE AUDIO CONTROL SO IT DOESN T ONLY CONTROL THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL MY PHONE AS WELL IN PARTICULAR I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE VOICE COMMANDS TO CALL SOMEONE IN MY PHONE DIRECTORY
NAVIGATION SYSTEM I CAN T FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE THE SCREEN OR TO GO FROM SCREEN TO SCREEN TURNING OFF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TURNS OFF THE RADIO TOO
PERHAPS IF SPEAKER WAS ON STEERING WHEEL IT WOULD PICK UP VOICE COMMANDS BETTER CAN NOT USE WITH TOP DOWN AC OR HEATER ON OR ANY OTHER NOISE NEARBY
THE METHOD OF DATA ENTRY FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DESTINATION ADDRESS ENTRY NEEDS TO BE RADICALLY IMPROVED THE CURRENT USER INTERFACE FOR THE NAV SYSTEM S DATA ENTRY IS ARCHAIC AND IT IS NEARLY UNUSABLE IN FACT MY WIFE WILL NEVER FIGURE O
THE VOICE COMMAND SUCKS SORRY
THE FEEL OF THE RADIO CONTROL KNOB IS SQUISHY IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE IT WANTS TO COME OFF EVEN THOUGH IT IS WELL SECURED TO THE DASH BOARD THE PRE SELECTED RADIO STATION BUTTONS SHOULD HAVE A MORE SOLID FEEL WHEN A SELECTION IS ENTERED
THE CAR WAS SOLD TO ME WITH SATELLITE RADIO AND IT WAS NOT ON THE VEHICLE AND HAD TO BE ADDED LATER THE RECEIVER IS NOW IN WHAT USED TO BE MY ASHTRAY VERY DISAPPOINTING FOR A CAR IN THIS PRICE RANGE
NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD IDENTIFY COMMANDS BETTER
VOICE ACTIVATED NOT AT EXPECTED LEVELS OF EFFECTIVENESS OR CONSISTENCY
SOUND QUALITY FROM SPEAKERS
VOICE COMMAND AND INABILITY TO PLUG IN MY IPHONE 6 MAKE THE SYSTEM NOT USEFUL
TOUCHSCREEN I LIKE IT BUT TOUCHSCREENS ARE NOW UBIQUITOUS
MOUSE IS EASY TO USE AND NAVIGATE ALL CONTROLS
VOICE ACTIVATION SYSTEM IS IRRATATING TOO MANY MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND SLOW
FIND NAVI TO BE A FLIP PHONE INSTEAD OF AN IPHONE BEHIND IN TECHNOLOGY
NAV SYSTEM COULD BE IN SUGGEST OPTIONS FOR A QUICKER COMMUTE I NOW USE WAZE FOR EVERYTHING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS DIFFICULT TO OPERATE THE CONTROL DIAL IS CONFUSING
GPS LACKS MANY FEATURES SUCH AS A TOUCH SCREEN
THERE ISNT SATELLITE RADIO
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOULD BE TOUCH SREEN IT IS HARD TO WORK WITH
THE NAV VOICE RECOGNITION IS HARD TO USE
MERCEDES BENZ APPS HAVE NEVER WORKED INTERNET RADIO IS A BUST AND THE CAR NEVER GETS A SIGNAL EVEN WITH ASSISTANCE MULTIPLE TIMES FROM THE HELP LINE AND FORGET ABOUT GOING ON LINE THE CONNECTION IF IT OCCURS CAN TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES AND THE PA
THE VOICE RECOGNITION CAPABILITY I FIND MYSELF HAVING TO REPEAT INFORMATION
THE ENTERTAINMENT ASPECT IS GREAT SOUND QUALITY IS FAIR AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS GOOD ONCE YOU CAN GET THE ADDRESS INTO THE SYSTEM
ADD SATELLITE RADIO CAPABILITY TO THE BASIC NON OPTIONAL RADIO
WOULD LIKE TO PICK VOICE THE NAVIGATION PROVIDES THE FEMALE VOICE IS HARD FOR MY HUSBAND TO HEAR NO OTHER VOICE OPTIONS
TAKES A LONG TIME WHEN THE VOICE RECOGNITION REPEATS BACK EVERYTHING I JUST SAID IT S ANNOYING ALSO THE NAVIGATION COULD USE IMPROVEMENT ON FINDING COUNTY ROADS LIKE 9679 SOUTH 1000 EAST IT DOESN T UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE SAME AS A STREET AD
THE HARMON KARDON SOUND SYSTEM IS GREAT WOULD LIKE A BLUETOOTH CONNECTION RATHER THAN HAVING TO USE A USB PORT
NOTE I DON T CONNECT IPHONE VIA USB PORT BUT RATHER VIA BLUETOOTH
NAVIGATION SYSTEM SHOW IT TO THE CUSTOMER WHEN HE BUYS IT
I THINK THE TECHNOLOGY MAY NEED TO BE SHARPENED I AM QUITE TECH SAVVY BUT REQUIRE D SOME TIME TO ADJUST AND ACCLIMATE TO THE TOOLS I WOULD RECOMMEND FIXING THE VOICE CONTROLS MAKING THE SPELLING SYSTEM AND ALL FEATURES MORE EASILY FOUND AND APP
NAVIGATION SYSTEM OPERATION HAS BEEN UNRELIABLE AND WOULD FORCE US TO USE ANOTHER SOURCE IF IT WAS NEEDED ON A TRIP ETC
1 NEITHER THE VOICE RECOGNITION NOR THE MANUAL ENTERING OF ADDRESSES IN THE NAV SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD BOTH ARE VERY CLUMSY MY IPHONE IS 10 TIMES A GOOD 2 BLUETOOTH AUDIO INTEGRATION WITH SPOTIFY IS MARGIN AS BEST CAN T USE STEERING CONTROLS T
DISPLAYING CD TRACK INFORMATION TITLE ALBUM ETC
MIC ABOVE PASSENGER FOR PHONE CALLS SPEAKER QUALITY WITH MORE BASS
THE Y CABLE IS HORRIBLE I CAN NOT ALWAYS CONNECT MY IPHONE 6 AND THE LOCATION OF WHERE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE PHONE IS NOT DRIVER FRIENDLY I LOVE MY COUNTRYMAN BUT I FIND THE ASPECT OF IT VERY DISAPPOINTING
SOUND QUALITY ON BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTION
NAVIGATION SYSTEM ISN T USER FRIENDLY AND THE VOICE IS STRANGE
IT IS HARD TO SEARCH ADJUST RADIO STATIONS IT IS NOT OBVIOUS HOW TO DO IT
NO OR REASONABLE COST FOR MAP UPDATES
BEING ABLE TO DIAL BY VOICE COMMANDS TEXTS SENT AND RECEIVED ETC FORD SYNC SYSTEM IS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF A USER FRIENDLY INTUITIVE SYSTEM
TOO MANY STEPS TO USE AND CHANGE RADIO STATIONS
TO IMPROVE THE VOICE COMMAND ASPECT OF THE SYSTEM
I WISH IT WAS EASIER TO FLUIDLY CHANGE BETWEEN SATELLITE RADIO AND MY IPHONE FOR PANDORA AND SIRI DIRECTIONS
THE MINI NEEDS MORE FEATURES SUCH AS AIR CONDITION SEATS BLIND SPOT DETECTION ELECTRIC SEATS NOT MANUAL
IT IS DIFFICULT TO ANSWER AND END A PHONE CALL WHILE DRIVING LOCATING THE CORRECT BUTTON
NO AUTOMATIC BLUETOOTH SYSTEM FOR THE MUSIC IS UNACCEPTABLE TODAY
WHEN I HAVE MY IPOD CONNECTED AND I SELECT SHUFFLE FROM THE CARS CONTROLS IT USUALLY JUST SHUFFLES BETWEEN 10 OR 15 SONGS
NEEDS BLUETOOTH CONNECTION FOR IPHONE
I WISH THE RADIO WOULD NOT COMPLETELY MUTE WHEN I HAD A CALL COME IN ON MY PHONE I USE MY HANDHELD VERSUS BLUTOOTH OPTION ON OCCASION I WOULD PREFER MY MUSIC TO REMAIN ON IN THE BACKGROUND ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY IT IS A SMART OPTION
CONNECTIVITY IS A PROBLEM & VOICE NAVIGATION IS PRETTY MUCH USELESS
I AM NOT A FAN OF THE JOY STICK APPROACH TO A NAVIGATION SYSTEM WAY TOO TIME CONSUMING
USB AUX CABLE LOCATION HORRIBLE NO BLUETOOTH AUDIO HORRIBLE BASE SPEAKERS AVERAGE MOVE THE LOCATION OF THE USB AUX CABLE AWAY FROM EMERGENCY BREAK
BETTER SOUND QUALITY FOR THE AUDIO
THE HD CHANNELS SEEM TO FADE IN AND OUT WHILE LISTENING NOT SURE WHAT TO ATTRIBUTE THAT TO
DON T LOCK OUT CONTROLS WHEN CAR IS IN DRIVE A PASSENGER VEHICLE CAN ACTUALLY HOLD A NON DRIVING PASSENGER WHO CANNOT OPERATE CONTROLS USED IPHONE INSTEAD THIS SYSTEM IS 10 STEPS BACK FROM THE SYSTEM IN MY LANCER ALMOST SOLELY RESPONSIBLE
BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY COULD BE BETTER
THE PHONE COMMUNICATIONS ON MY NEW COUNTRYMAN ARE 100 TIMES BETTER THAN MY MINI COOPER S I M VERY PLEASED WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS
BLUETOOTH AUDIO MUSIC CAPABILITY COULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED
IDRIVE INTERFACE IS HORRIBLE THESE DAYS IT SHOULD BE A TOUCH SCREEN BUT EVEN THE CONTROLS ARE POORLY IMPLEMENTED HAVE A LOOK AT FORD S SYNC UI IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW TO DO IN VEHICLE CONTROLS
MULTIPLE CD PLAYER WOULD REALLY BE APPRECIATED
NO NAVIGATIONAL SYSTEM
VOICE COMMAND HAS DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING THE COMMANDS AND HENCE EXECUTING THEM
AS MUCH AS I PAID FOR CAR IT SHOULD HAVE CAME WITH BLUETOOTH VERY LAME
COMMUNICATION WITH IPHONE MUSIC IS SLOW AND CLUNKY DASH DISPLAY UPDATE OF SONG TITLE IS SLOW TO UPDATE SOMETIMES AND IT HAS FROZEN SEVERAL TIMES DURING USE AND I HAVE HAD TO RECONNECT THE PHONE AND POWER CYCLE THE RADIO TO CLEAR IT OUT
FOR A VEHICLE IT IS A BIT BEHIND THE TIMES WHEN IT COMES TO IN CAR ENTERTAINMENT TOUCH SCREEN SYSTEMS IT S A BIT OUT DATED LOOKING MENU IS DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING IT IS REALLY TOUGH TO USE IT REALLY TAKES MY EYES OF
I WISH IT HAD BLUETOOTH
1 IT IS EASY TO SELECT PRE PROGRAMMED RADIO CHANNELS WHILE DRIVING BUT DIFFICULT IF THE STATION IS NOT PRE PROGRAMMED THIS INCLUDES SWITCHING TO A STATION S HD CHANNEL AND 2 IT IS NOT THE EASIEST TO ADJUST THE SOUND CONTROL WHILE DRIVING
I DON T LIKE HOW IT AUTOMATICALLY SWITCHES TO PLAYING MUSIC ON MY PHONE WHEN I CONNECT THE USB JUST TO CHARGE MY PHONE AND IT INTERRUPTS ME IF I M LISTENING TO SIRIUS OR AM FM RADIO
CELL PHONE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION SEEMS TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH EITHER CONNECTIVITY OR WITH AMBIENT NOISE ALSO PHONE VOLUME IS TOO LOW UNKNOWN IF SYSTEM HAS A PROBLEM OR IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY OUTLANDER BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
EASE THAT THE BLUETOOTH SYNCS UP AND CAN BE USED
THE HANDS FREE COMMUNICATION IS SLOPPY HALF THE WORDS OR SONGS IT GETS WRONG ALWAYS TRYING TO CALL WHEN I AS FOR A SONG TO BE PLAYED
USB AND LIGHTNING PORT FOR IPHONE 6
HANDS FREE PHONE COULD BE EASIER TO RESPOND TO DIRECTORY
ADD CARPLAY APPLE IPHONE INSTEAD OF PROPRIETARY AND BASICALLY OBSOLETE   SLOW APPLICATIONS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM NOT EASY TO PROGRAM SCREEN AND GRAPHICS NEED UPDATING
THE BUILT IN IPHONE WIRE ATTACHMENT CHARGER CONNECTION WAS FRAYED AFTER ONE MONTH
VOICE RECOGNITION IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT
PROVIDE USERS MANUAL APPLICABLE TO GL450 ALLOW POI SELECTION IE HOTEL OR MARRIOTT HOTELS ETC
MORE EXPLANATION OF THE VOICE CONTROL PROGRAM
NAVIGATION SHOULD BE TOUCH SCREEN AND IT WILL BE EASIER TO ACCESS
THE IPOD CONNECTION WIRE SUCKS IT KEEPS FRAYING AND SPLITTING AT THE CONNECTION PART THAT GOES INTO THE IPHONE I HAVE TAKEN BACK 4 TIMES NOW TO DEALER FOR A NEW ONE FIX IT
THE NAVI IS HARD TO USE TOO MANY THINGS ON THE SCREEN THE VOICE IS ALWAYS ON WITH TRAFFIC INFO THAT IT BECOMES DISTRACTING
GPS NAVIGATION NOT RELIABLE� NEED TO HAVE EITHER MY OWN CELL PHONE GPS OR SOMEONE ELSE S TO ASSURE MORE ACCURATE DIRECTIONS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS WAY BEHIND THE TIMES
USE OF VOICE RECOGNITION SO I CAN KEEP MY EYES ON ROAD BUT VOICE REC RARELY WORKS TO GIVE ME WHAT I WANT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE DONE THE TRAINING EXERCISE IN THE MANUAL SO I HAVE TO MANUALLY DO EVERYTHING WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO LOOK AT INSTRUMENTS
NO TOUCH SCREEN SO INPUT ADDRESS IS DIFFICULT
I PAID A LOT OF MONEY TO SIGN UP FOR MBRACE AND WHEN I TRIED TO USE IT HAVE THEM LOAD A LOCATION INTO MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM THEY SAID THAT WAS NOT PART OF MY PLAN SERIOUSLY I CAN JUST ASK MY CELL PHONE TO GET ME DIRECTIONS EASIER THAN I CAN USE
VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
TOO MANY MENUS AND TOO MUCH NAVIGATION REQUIRED SIMPLIFY
I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM TO WORK THE WOMAN AT THE DEALERSHIP WHO TRIED TO SHOW ME HOW TO USE IT DIDN T HAVE MUCH BETTER LUCK AND AS I VE MENTIONED BEFORE I TRULY DISLIKE THE CONTROL KNOB THAT IS ON THE CENTER CONSOLE
PLACEMENT OF CONTROLS COULD BE BETTER FOR EASE OF USE SHOULD HAVE A MULTI DISC CD PLAYER SETTING UP THE CALLER LIST FOR HANDS FREE PHONE SHOULD BE EASY
BLUETOOTH PAIRING IS OK IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A PREFERRED SETTING SO WHEN TWO USERS ARE IN THE CAR YOU CAN EASILY SELECT WHICH USER S PHONE SHOULD NORMALLY BE CONNECTED
SIMPLIFY VOICE COMMANDS OR MAKE THEM MORE INTUITIVE OR ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND VARIOUS PHRASES FOR THE SAME COMMAND
MY NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT GIVE VOICE INSTRUCTIONS I NEED TO USE MY GARMIN GPS FOR THIS
THE NAVIGATION AND MAPPING FROM THE CAR IS DIFFICULT DOING IT FROM MBRACE IS GREAT
I FIND THE NAV TRICKY SO I JUST USE MY PHONE BUT I HAVNT MADE THE TIME TO TRULY LEARN TO USE IT
NAVIGATION VOICE DOES NOT GET CORRECT INSTRUCTIONS VERY FRUSTRATING
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS A BIT COMPLICATED IT IS VERY ACCURATE BUT SOMEWHAT CONFUSING AND TAKES PRACTICE THE AUDIO CENTER IS A BIT BORING
NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS FRUSTRATING WHEN TRYING TO LOCATE POINTS OF INTEREST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A PLACE AND IT BRINGS IT UP ON THE SCREEN
BETTER RECOGNITION OF VOICE COMMANDS
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR NAV IS POOR COMPUTER IS VERY SLOW INTERNET ACCESS IS SO SLOW IT IS UNUSABLE
THE TRAFFIC NOTIFICATIONS ARE AWFUL THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM GIVES YOU IRRELEVANT TRAFFIC INFORMATION AND IT S NOT EASY TO SILENCE IT OR TURN OFF THAT SETTING THIS NEEDS TO BE RETHOUGHT ENTIRELY
RADIO CONTROLS ARE POORLY DESIGNED
I DO NOT LIKE THE DISPLAY OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM VERY DIFFICULT I HAVE USED OTHER SYSYTEMS ON FORDS AND MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY
DOES NOT HAVE TOUCH SCREEN FEATURE SIZE TOO SMALL COLOR RESOLUTION IS NOT THAT GREAT WITH THE VEHICLE LIKE THIS IT SHOULD BE BY FAR LUXURIOUS AND ATTRACTIVE SHARP SOMETHING OUTSTANDING THAN ANY OTHER MANUFACTURER IN COMPETITION IN ITS CLASS
PREMIUM AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD BE STANDARD IN SUCH A FINE AUTOMOBILE
SOUND QUALITY OF STEREO ID EXCELLENT
I DO NOT HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM AND DO NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE AUDIO SYSTEM
PUT PREMIUM SOUND SYSTEMS IN ALL ALTIMAS THE CARS LOOK GREAT THE EXTRA FEATURES BACKUP CAMERA BLUETOOTH ETC ARE GREAT THE SOUND SYSTEM IS AVERAGE
I DO NOT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IN CAR I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ONE THE BLUETOOTH IS EXTREMELY USEFUL I DO ENJOY THE RADIO CHOICES
THERE SHOULD BE AN EASIER WAY TO DIAL FREQUENTLY USED NUMBERS A FAVORITES SCREEN FOR FREQUENTLY DIALED PHONE NUMBERS
DON T USE USB STILL GLAD IT IS THERE
USE A NAMEBRAND AUDIO SYSTEM I HAVE NO NAME AUDIO SYSTEM QUALITY NOT THAT GREAT
ALLOW ENTRY OF DESTINATION WHILE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION E G BY FRONT SEAT PASSENGER
I WOULD HAVE VERY MUCH LIKED A HARD DRIVE RECORDING SYSTEM FOR THE AUDIO AS IN THE G37 I AM ALSO NOT A BIG FAN OF BOSE IN GENERAL SINCE GOOD SOUND IN A SMALL SPACE IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE I WOULD APPRECIATE A BIT MORE ATTENTION TO SOUND
VOICE COMMANDS TO MAKE CALLS ARE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO USE
THE SOUND OF THE BLUETOOTH PHONE CALLS ARE TOO LOW
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO USE I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME CHANGING STATIONS WHILE DRIVING I ONLY RELY ON THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS TO CHANGE STATIONS
APPS ARE DIFFICULT TO USE
THE MICROPHONE USED FOR MAKING PHONE CALLS NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED I FEEL I MUST SHOUT TO BE HEARD WHILE SPEAKING ON THE PHONE
I DON T LIKE HOW FAR THE DRIVER HAS TO REACH OVER TO SCAN FOR A RADIO STATION OR SATELLITE RADIO SATION IT S A VERY FAR REACH FOR THE DRIVER I ALSO WISH IT CAME STANDARD WITH NAVIGATION
USB PORT DOES NOT READ CONNECT TO ALL PHONES BUT MOSTLY USE WITH IPOD SO IT WORKS FOR ME
THE AUDIO SYSTEM IS GREAT NOT TOO FANCY BUT STILL APPEALING ON THE DOWNSIDE SIRRUS SATELLITE RADIO HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY HOUNDING ME TO SIGN UP FOR A CONTRACT THIS IS VERY ANNOYING I HAVE TOLD THEM NO MANY TIMES BUT THEY KEEP CALLING AND CALL
EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BOSE THE QUALITY OF SOUND ISN T WHAT I EXPECTED
NAVIGATION WOULD BE GREAT AND IN DASH SCREEN COULD BE MORE INTERACTIVE
ADD THE ABILITY TO CHANGE RADIO CHANNELS TO THE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS
NAVIGATION SYSTEM FEATURE TO DISABLE FEATURE OF CHANGING GUIDANCE WHILE DRIVING
NISSAN APP IS WORTHLESS AND DIFFICULT TO USE
PHONE VOICE CONTROLS ARE TEDIOUS THE COMPUTER VOICE IS A BIT TOO CHATTY FOR MY LIKING I DON T NEED A COMPUTER TALKING IN FULL SENTENCES GET TO THE POINT
NAVIGATION IS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE
WE JUST DON T USE DEVICES THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR DRIVING IF WE TOOK LONG TRIPS MAYBE WE WOULD IF EQUIPPED WITH NAVIGATION WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE WE USE PLUG IN GPS SYSTEMS I DO PREFER BUTTONS ON STEERING WHEEL OPPOSE TO TOGGLE FOR ENGAGING CRUSE B
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS NOT VERY INTUITIVE NAVIGATING BY PHONE IS MUCH EASIER
WOULD PREFER UPDATABLE MAPS WITH NAVIGATION SYSTEM LIKE GARMIN
THE APPS FUNCTIONALITY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
IPHONE IPOD BLUETOOTH INTERACTION IS LOUSY
THE VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THE NAVIGATION REQUIRES TOO MANY STEPS TO SET UP IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO USE THE MAP APPS ON MY SMART PHONE I CAN JUST TELL SIRI WHERE I WANT TO GO AND SHE MAPS IT FOR ME I WAS EXCITED TO HAVE
QUALITY AND VOLUME WHEN MAKING PHONE CALLS RING VOLUME IS CONSIDERABLY LOUDER THAN VOLUME WHILE SPEAKING
BASS RESPONSE VOLUME FROM THE FACTORY SUBWOOFER COULD BE IMPROVED
READ EMAILS TEXT SEND EMAIL TEXT HANDS FREE
ON THE NAVIGATION MAP SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO TELL THE TRAFFIC AHEAD COLORS BLEND IN WITH THE FREEWAY OR MAP BACKGROUND
NAVIGATION DISPLAY AND USE IS CONVOLUTED
AS I MENTIONED BEFORE KNOBS ON THE RADIO WOULD BE BEST IT S HARD TO QUICKLY GET TO RADIO STATIONS THAT AREN T ON PRESET
THE VOICE RECOGNITION NEEDS TO IMPROVE IT DOESN T MISINTERPRETS WHAT IS SAID
BLUETOOTH WORKS WITH PHONES ONLY BUT NOT MEDIA PLAYERS CAN NOT PLAY STREAMING MUSIC FROM PHONE
ENTERING ADDRESSES IN THE NAV SYSTEM COULD BE MADE EASIER THAT MAY BE MY INEXPERIENCE WITH THE SYSTEM
MOBILE PHONE AUDIO MENUS ARE CUMBERSOME
I FEEL IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO USE THE PHONE WHILE DRIVING I E MAKING CALLS VOICE RECOGNITION ISN T VERY RELIABLE AND HANDS FREE TO INITIATE CALLS IS EITHER IMPOSSIBLE OR MUST BE TOO DIFFICULT BECAUSE I SURE HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW TO MASTER IT
BUTTONS ON TOUCH SCREEN WAY TOO SMALL   BUNCHED UP TOGETHER TOO CLOSE SOUND OF MUSIC VIA ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM AVERAGE AT BEST
FIX THE LAG IN CONVERSATION WHEN USING BLUETOOTH FOR HANDS FREE PHONE
VOICE RECOGNITION FOR PHONE CALLS IS PRACTICALLY USELESS BECAUSE OF ITS POOR RECOGNITION AND STILTED COMMANDS OTHERWISE I D GIVE THE SYSTEM A 7 OR 8
I DON T SEEM TO BE ABLE TO INPUT A DESTINATION BY NAME I CAN ONLY INPUT AN ADDRESS OR TYPE OF DESTINATION MAYBE I COULD DO IT BUT HAVEN T FIGURED OUT HOW
NAVIGATION AND BACK UP SYSTEM SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT
THE HANDS FREE CALLING VIA THE BLUETOOTH JUST TAKES WAYYYYY TOO LONG I HAVEN T LOOKED IN THE HANDBOOK YET TO SEE IF I CAN SHORTEN THE STUPID INTROS THE WOMAN SAYS HI SO YOU WANT TO MAKE A CALL WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO YOU CAN SAY THESE TH
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO EDIT LOAD ADDRESSES AND PHONE NUMBERS FROM THE LEAF WEBSITE DOING IT IN THE CAR OR SYNCING WITH PHONE IS A MESS
THE BLUETOOTH FOR USING PHONE WHILE DRIVING IS AVERAGE BUTTONS ON THE STEERING WHEEL SEEM A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO FIND MAYBE DESIGN IS NOT REALLY A DESIGN WITH GOOD VISIBILITY
SKIP INCLUDING SATELITE RADIO MAKE RADIO BALANCE BASS TREBLE TYPE SETTINGS EASIER TO FIND
BETTER VOICE RECOGNITION WOULD BE NICE
NOT HAVING SO MUCH OF THE MENU READ EVERY TIME I USE THE BLUETOOTH PHONE APPLICATION
NAVIGATION INTERFACE TAKES GETTING USED TO I VE USED TOM TOM GARMIN AND GOOGLE MAPS PRIOR AND ALL ARE MUCH EASIER TO USE WOULD LIKE BETTER LANE GUIDANCE AS WELL & OPTION TO DOWNLOAD OTHER VOICES THE TRAFFIC SEEMS TO ONLY WORK IN MAJOR METRO
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM AS DID THE ONE IN OUR VERSA LOCATED OUR HOUSE ON THE WRONG END OF OUR STREET 1 2 MILE AWAY FROM WHERE IT ACTUALLY IS
ADDITION OF APPLE CARPLAY TO NAVIGATION SYSTEM
TOO MANY OPTIONS ON NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE DIGITAL READOUT OF CATEGORIES AND TUNES ON SATELLITE RADIO IS LIMITED TO EIGHT CHARACTERS WHERE IT S OBVIOUS THAT THE STATION IS SENDING OUT MORE INFORMATION
I WISH I COULD PLAY PANDORA AND USE THE MUSIC FROM MY PHONE THROUGH THE USB BUT IT WON T ALLOW ME TO
VOICE RECOGNITION SW IS POOR IT IS ESSENTIALLY UNUSABLE
THE DIAL THAT CONTROLS THE RADIO STATIONS IS ANNOYING I GO PAST THE STATION AND THEN PAST IT AGAIN SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE I GET THE DIAL TO STOP ON THE STATION I WANT A DIAL OR BUTTON THAT WAS MORE DEFINITE WHEN LANDING ON A STATION WOULD BE GRE
I M SURPRISED THAT IN THE LEATHER LEVEL BLUETOOTH ISN T STANDARD WE DID NOT GET THE TECH PACKAGE AS IT WAS OUT OF OUR PRICE RANGE FOR ALL THE LUXURY FEEL OF THE VEHICLE NOT HAVING BLUETOOTH SEEMS ODD I D DEFINITELY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO USE VOI
VOICE RECOGNITION DIFFICULT TO USE
INTEGRATE TRAFFIC FROM OTA RADIO AND NOT USE XM XM WARNINGS ARE ANNOYING AND WORTHLESS BY NOT PROVIDING ANY INFORMATION
VOICE COMMANDS NEED TO BE SIMPLIFIED
THEY NEED TO ADD MORE INTERNET APPLICATIONS THEY CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORT GOOGLE SEARCH
IF THERE IS A BETTER MICROPHONE FOR HANDS FREE CALLING
THE NAVIGATION CANNOT BE USED WHEN DRIVING YOU CAN T INPUT ANYTHING WHICH IS REALLY INCONVENIENT WHEN THE PASSENGER IS TRYING TO FIND A SPECIFIC PLACE WHILE YOU DRIVE
I DON T LIKE THE LAYOUT OF THE XM MENU TOO MANY CLICKS
A STANDARD USB PORT WOULD BE A NICE FEATURE
OTHER THAN SIRIUS RADIO I VE RARELY USED ANY EVENTUALLY I WILL
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DISPLAY PANEL IS TOO BRIGHT FOR NIGHT TIME THE PANEL LIGHT IS SO BRIGHT IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE
MARK IT MORE SIMPLE OR LINK WITH IPHONE SO THAT THE TWO NAV SYSTEM COULD BE DELAYED ON THE CARS SYSTEM
VOICE COMMANDS TO MAKE CALLS IS CUMBERSOME
NOT ABLE TO VOICE COMMAND SMART PHONE VIA BLUETOOTH
THE NISSAN CONNECT APP NEEDS WORK FOR EASE OF USE AND INTEGRATION TO AUDIO SYSTEM WOULD LIKE USE OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM IF PASSENGER SEAT IS OCCUPIED IF NOT OCCUPIED MUST STOP VEHICLE TO RE ROUTE
ANDROID COMPATABILITY WRITE ACTUAL TEXTS NOT JUST SEND PRESAVED
THE WEATHER UPDATES ARE REALLY ANNOYING ESPECIALLY IF I AM ON THE HANDS FREE PHONE AND I TRY TO TURN IT DOWN AND END UP DISCONNECTING MY CALL
SOME NAVIGATION FEATURES THAT CAN T BE USED WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO USE
EASIER USE OF NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE SYSTEM DOES NOT HAVE GOOD POINTS OF INTEREST THE NAVIGATION IS HARD TO INPUT A DESTINATION IT TAKES TOO MANY STEPS TO SELECT THE REGION STATE ADDRESS STREET ECT
MAKING CALLS USING THE VOICE RECOGNITION ISN T CLEAR NAVIGATION IS HARD TO USE AT TIMES
PERSON ON OTHER END OF PHONE CALL CAN NEVER HEAR ME EVEN WHEN VOLUME IS TURNED AS HIGH AS IT CAN GO I DON T UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE SOME OF THE NAVIGATION FEATURES AND I AM UNABLE TO FIGURE IT OUT
EASE OF READING NAVIGATION SIGNS ON THE MAP SCREEN
NO NAVIGATION SYSTEM AVAILABLE
VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTROL THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM FROM THE FRONT SEAT OFTEN TOLD THAT OPERATION INVALID WHILE I TRY TO FAST FORWARD OR REWIND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL MORE OF WHAT IS BEING DISPLAYED
WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS BETTER INTEGRATION WITH THE IPHONE OR MOBILE DEVICES FEELS CLUNKIER THAN WHEN I USED MY IPHONE IN MY INFINITI SAME COMPANY WHY IS THIS WORSE
I WISH SATELLITE RADIO WASN T SO EXPENSIVE
NO USB AND HAVE TO CONNECT WITH AUX TO LISTEN TO IPOD OR PHONE CALLS
GET A 21ST CENTURY NAV SYSTEM IN THIS VEHICLE STILL LOOKS AND OPERATES AS A VERY DATED SYSTEM
WE HAVE THE BASIC MODEL OF OUR VEHICLE THUS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS AVERAGE FOR THAT IT S GREAT WE WOULD LIKE THE ABILITY TO PLUG IN AUX AND OR USB TO BE STANDARD OPTION
THE VOICE COMMAND MENU IS AWFUL AND CANNOT RECOGNIZE ANY NAMES IN MY PHONEBOOK WHEN I AM TRYING TO MAKE A CALL
IT WOULD NOT BE FAIR FOR ME TO COMMENT BECAUSE I ONLY USE SIRIUS XM AND FM RADIO
NISSAN CONNECT DOESN T WORK WELL WITH THE IPHONE A VERY POPULAR DEVICE ALSO ONE OF THE USB PORTS IS IN A POOR LOCATION IN A SLOT IN THE CONSOLE BEHIND A DOOR YOU CAN T STORE THE PHONE IN THE POCKET WHILE USING THE USB CONNECTOR AND IF YO
NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS NOT ALWAYS BEST ROUTE HAS DIRECTED THROUGH NEIGHBORHOODS INSTEAD OF STAYING ON MAIN ROADS
MY ROGUE HAS THE BOSE SYSTEM WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE AN UPGRADE FROM THE STANDARD SOUND SYSTEM HOWEVER I DON T REALLY NOTICE ANY DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE FROM MY ALTIMA S STANDARD SYSTEM THIS HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT
THE DIAL TO CHANGE THE RADIO CHANNELS SHOULD BE ON THE LEFT I HAVE TO REACH ACROSS TO THE RIGHT DIAL TO CHANGE THE SIRIUS XM STATIONS WITH THE DIAL ALSO I LIKED THE PLACEMENT OF THE PHONE STUFF BETTER ON THE ROGUE
GO BACK TO 6 CD PLAYER
BLUETOOTH DOESN T WORK RIGHT DEALER SUPPOSED TO ORDER PARTS BUT HAS NEVER CONTACTED ME
STANDARD LARGER SCREEN STANDARD TOUCH SCREEN
MY BLUETOOTH COULD BE IMPROVED
VOICE RECOGINITION WHEN TRYING TO MAKE PHONE CALL
TOUCH SCREEN WOULD BE A NICE ADDITION
DO NOT HAVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
NAVIGATION SYSTEM VERY MICKEY MOUSE COMPARED TO LESS EXPENSIVE MODELS LIKE A CHEVY CRUZE NOT ENOUGH STREET DETAIL DISPLAY HARD TO SEE IN THE SUN NOT ENOUGH CONTRAST ON SCREEN
THE FIRST TIME I USED THE NAVIGATION THE VEHICLE ENDED UP IN THE WRONG PLACE 5 MILES OFF I HAVEN T CONNECTED MY PHONE OR AUDIO DEVICES BUT AN PLEASED THE CONNECTIVETY IS AVILABLE FOR FUTURE USE
SOME STREET DON T SHOW UP ON THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM PROBLEMS USING VOICE CONTROL SOMETIMES
THE NISSAN APP IS ESSENTIALLY USELESS AS I DON T USE PANDORA IHEARTRADIO ETC AS WELL WHY ON EARTH WOULD I WANT FACEBOOK CONNECTIVITY IN MY CAR MY CAR IS THE SWEET ZEN LIKE ESCAPE FROM A WORLD SATURATED BY SOCIAL MEDIA NONSENSE NOTE I M A 29
BETTER SPEAKER SOUND QUALITY WHEN ON BLUETOOTH PHONE
PANDORA CONTROLS FROM THE SCREEN I CURRENTLY HAVE TO CHANGE STATIONS FROM MY PHONE MAYBE THERE IS AN APP THAT WILL HELP THAT I M NOT AWARE OF
NEED TO IMPROVE NAVIGATION SYSTEM GETTING YOU TO THE CORRECT DESTINATION
WINDOW MUST BE CLOSED SO AS NOT TO DISTORT THE AUDIO WHEN USING THE BLUETOOTH
THE VOICE RECOGNITION IS NOT GOOD IT SHOULD BE ONE BUTTON AND THE XTERRA HAS ONE BUTTON AND THEN MANY CHOICES STICK TO SIMPLE THE CAR HAS 4 APPS AND NO ABILITY TO ADD MORE I WOULD LIKE SPOTIFY OVER PANDORA OR THE OPTION FOR BOTH ADD IN E
NIGHT ILLUMINATION OF THE NAV SCREEN IS NOT WELL DETAILED VOICE COMMAND FOR PHONE CONTACT LIST TYPICALLY CAN T IDENTIFY AN ENTRY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HIDE TOUCHSCREEN CONTROLS ON THE NAVIGATION WINDOW THEY HIDE TOO MUCH OF THE MAP
TEXTING AND TEXT NOTIFICATION COULD CONTINUE TO WORK INSTEAD OF BREAKING AND NOT WORKING AFTER 4 MONTHS
ONE OF THE THINGS I HATE THE MOST IN THE ENTIRE CAR IS THAT WHEN I PLUG IN MY PHONE TO CHARGE IT AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON THE ITUNES I VE HEARD THE SAME SONG START 1000 TIMES
BLUETOOTH USE ON THE PHONE PEOPLE HAVE A HARD TIME HEARING THEY SAY THERE IS A LOT OF NOISE BUT I HEAR THEM FINE AND THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM COULD BE MORE USER FRIENDLY BUT WITH THAT IN MIND I HAVE NOT HAD TIME TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS BUT HAV
THE VOLUME NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE HIGHER IN THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM
SPEAKERS ON AUDIO SYSTEM SHOULD BE IMPROVED
DISPLAY IS BASIC UNINSPIRING AND PRETTY MUCH JUST TEXT BASED BUT IT IS EFFECTIVE VOICE ACTIVATION AND COMMANDS JUST SEEM ELUSIVE I DON T USE THEM HARDLY EVER BUT WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT HOW TO USE THEM BETTER JUST SEEMS UNINTUITIVE AND TH
IMPROVE THE VOICE RECOGNITION AS NOTED EARLIER
THE CONTROL DIAL FOR CHANGING STATIONS IS TOO SENSITIVE TUNING KNOB OFTEN CAUSING ME TO GO SEVERAL STATIONS WHEN I WANT TO JUST GO ONE
SCROLLING THROUGH IPOD ARTISTS ALBUMS ETC IS CUMBERSOME WOULD BE NICE TO EASILY TO LEAP TO LETTERS FURTHER DOWN THE ALPHABET
THE LOOK OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED PERHAPS BY ADDING BETTER AND MORE ATTRACTIVE BACKLIGHTING
I USE AN IPHONE CONNECTED BY USB FOR CHARGE GPS MUSIC LINE LEVEL VOLUME OF PLAYER ALSO CONNECTED VIA BLUETOOTH FOR CALLS � THE STEREO SYSTEM USES ITS OWN MIC AND SPEAKERS FOR SPEAKING TEXTS ET CETERA TO MY PHONE SOMETIME USING VOICE SEARC
IT IS A PIECE OF JUNK THIS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH BETTER FOR WHAT IT COST AND THE FACT THAT THE IPHONE HAS TO BE CONNECTED VIA USB FOR CERTAIN FUNCTIONS IS ABSOLUTELY STUPID
HAVE A STEERING WHEEL THAT HAS BOTH TRADITIONAL SHIFT PADDLES AND HAND CONTROLS FOR THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM
ADD USB SUPPORT OF ANDROID OR STOP TELLING US ABOUT HOW WE CAN CONNECT OUR NONEXISTENT IPOD TO THE USB AND HAVE THE USB PLUG ACTUALLY CHARGE DEVICES A LITTLE BIT MORE
I WAS EXCITED TO USE THE ONBOARD APPS THE ONLY APPS THAT I CAN USE ARE TWO MUSIC APPS AND FACEBOOK I WANT WEATHER MAPS REAL APPS FOR NAVIGATION A BIG LET DOWN I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO UPGRADE SYSTEMS ON THE TOP OF THE LINE S MODEL WITHOUT
A MORE ATTRACTIVE LCD DISPLAY INTERACTION WOULD HELP ENHANCE DESIRABILITY IN ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF EV S CONSIDERING AN EXTERNAL INCLUSION OF ANDROIDAUTO AND CARPLAY COULD EASILY IMPROVE THE USER EXPERIENCE GREATLY
CAN T SEEM TO USE AN IPHONE OR GALAXY NOTE 3 AS A MEDIA DEVICE TO PLAY MUSIC BUT MAYBE I M MISSING SOMETHING BUT THE USB PORT IS A GREAT FEATURE
SOMETIMES THE VOICE RECOGNITION FOR THE HANDS FREE CALL SYSTEM DOESN T RECOGNIZE THE NAME REQUESTED FROM THE STORED CONTACTS
NAVIGATION IS TIED TO SD CARD NAVIGATION SHUTS DOWN WHEN SD CARD IS REMOVED AND THATS THE ONLY SD SLOT SHOULD HAVE STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS ADDED
THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION ENTERTAINMENT OR NAVIGATION SYSTEM
THE NAVIGATION COULD BE BETTER IT GAVE ME A CRAZY ROUTE WHEN I WAS DRIVING THROUGH HOLLYWOOD AND DOWN TO IRVINE I USE MY WAZE APPLICATION ON MY CELL PHONE INSTEAD OF THE BRZ S NAVIGATION INSTEAD THE BRZ S NAVIGATION SEEMS TO FAVOR CITY STREE
I HAD TO INSTALL THRU THE DEALER AND AFTER MARKET RADIO   GPS  BLUETOOTH ITS NOT THAT GREAT PPL CANT HEAR ME OVER THE PHONE AND I HAVE NO CONTROLS ON THE WHEEL
POOR BASS RESPONSE NEEDS BLUETOOTH
THE SYSTEM IS OK BY FACTORY STANDARDS BUT WOULD BE BETTER IF IT WERE THE KENWOOD SYSTEM THE KENWOOD IS INTUITIVE AND USES GARMIN FOR THE NAVIGATION
THE NISSAN APP IS DIFFICULT TO CONNECT TO DEVICES CAN T GET THE IPOD TO CONNECT ALL THE WAY SO HAVE TO TAKE MY EYES FROM THE ROAD TO CHANGE MUSIC
TRAFFIC INFO IS OFTEN INCORRECT OR OUTDATED VOICE COMMAND SYSTEM IS KIND OF TEDIOUS BUT IT WORKS WELL
ADD BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY
IT NEEDS EITHER A TOUCH CONTROL INTERFACE OR A G U I THAT IS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY
ABILITY OF OTHER PARTY TO HEAR WHEN USING BLUETOOTH FOR PHONE CALLS
BLUETOOTH DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE YOU ARE CALLING TO HEAR YOU
TAKES ALONG TIME LOAD SONGS FROM USB DRIVE OR IPOD THEY HAPPENS EVERY TIME YOU TURN THE CAR OFF
PRELOAD XM SIRIUS ON OS MODEL
THE UPGRADED TOUCH SCREEN RADIO SHOULD BE STANDARD
SPEAKERS SEEM TO BE CHEAP AND SOUND QUALITY AND LOUDNESS COULD BE IMPROVED
WHEN USING THE HANDS FREE PHONE THE SOUND OF THE CALL IS DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO UNDERSTAND
WHEN U PICK UP THE PHONE CALL U HAVE TO SAY HELLO ABOUT THREE TIMES BEFORE THE OTHER PARTY HEARS U WHEN USING BLUETOOTH FUSE SYSTEM
PUT A BETTER AUDIO SYSTEM IN THE CAR YOU NEED TO ALMOST MAX THE VOLUME TO HEAR CERTAIN COMPONENTS
MAKE THE MENU NAVIGATION MORE INTUITIVE
ADD AN AUX JACK
WHEN CONNECTED TO BLUETOOTH AND HAVING ANSWERED A PHONE CALL OFTEN HAVE TO PRESS TRANSFER CALL BECAUSE IT IS STUCK IN A LIMBO OF SORTS
I USE THE FM RADIO AND BLUTOOTH FOR MY PHONE TO RECEIVE CALLS DON T REALLY TAKE THE TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT
VOICE RECOGNITION SOUND QUALITY OF HANDS FREE PHONE COULD BE BETTER
USING FLASH DRIVE CONNECTED TO USB THAT IS SELECTING TRACKS TO LISTEN TO
I NEED SOME TRAINING WITH PARING MY PHONE WITH VEHICLE SO AT THIS TIME I CAN T JUDGE ANY ASPECT OF BLUETOOTH
I AM HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY CAR S IPOD INTERFACE IT MAY JUST BE MY PARTICULAR CAR THE OVERALL MAXIMUM VOLUME OF THE AUDIO SYSTEM COULD BE HIGHER
NAVIGATION IS RIDICULOUSLY BYZANTINE AND USER UNFRIENDLY SERIOUSLY CONTRACT WITH SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS MAPPING AND DIRECTIONS AND USER INTERFACES I WILL USE GOOGLE MAPS ON MY PHONE BEFORE I USE THAT RIDICULOUS NAVI SYSTEM
BETTER SOUND QUALITY BUT I KNOW I WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR IT IT MEANT BUYING A MORE EXPENSIVE VEHICLE FOR THE UPGRADED RADIO

SOME OF THE SAFETY SIGNALS WHEN BACKING UP ARE A LITTLE OBNOXIOUS AT TIMES ESPECIALLY WHEN BACKING OUT OF THE GARAGE COULD BE AUTOMATED TO RECOGNIZE IMMEDIATE ISSUES OR NOT BEEP WHEN BACKING UP OUT OF A GARAGE THAT YOU BACKUP OUT OF EVERYDAY
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING INTO LANES PULLING OUT FROM SOME SIDE ROADS
LARGE BLINDSPOTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE I HAD TO ADD SMALL CONCAVE MIRRORS TO THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS TO COVER THE BLIND SPOTS
I INSTALL BLIND SIDE MIRRORS ON THE FACTORY SIDE MIRRORS THE HEAD REST FROM BACK SEAT CAN ALSO HELP HIDE CARS FROM YOU
COULD USE RAIN SENSOR WIPERS COULD USE HEADLIGHTS THAT MOVE WITH STEERING THAT WOULD BEUSEFULL AND COOL
GOOD VISIBILITY
WIDER AND A BIT LONGER SUN VISORS
THE VEHICLE HAS GOOD VISIBILITY AND FEEL SAFE IN MOST OF DRIVING SITUATION
THE NISSAN AROUND VIEW CAMERA IS EXCELLENT IT IS THE BEST SYSTEM THAT I HAVE USED
THE BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT DUE TO THE WAY SEATS AND WINDOWS ARE ARRANGED
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT AT THE FRONT LEFT PILLAR MAKES IT DIFFICULT WHEN MAKING LEFT TURNS
THE VEHICLE HAS A VERY BAD BLIND SPOT ON BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE WORSE THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR WHICH WAS A COROLLA THE CAUSE IS SOLID DIVIDER BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK DOORS
SLIGHT BLIND SPOT IN RIGHT REAR
THE REARVIEW CAMERA IS USELESS IN RAINY CONDITIONS WATER DROPLETS OBSCURE THE CAMERA VIEW
BLIND SPOTS MIRRORS OBSTRUCT VIEW OF ON COMMING TRAFFIC WHEN TURNING
NEEDS TO HAVE BUILT IN BLIND SPOT MIRRORS IN THE LARGE MIRROR LIKE FORD HAS
NEED BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
IMPROVE THE REAR CAMERA
I AM 5 1 THEREFORE WHEN I MOVE MY SEAT ALL THE WAY FORWARD ON EACH SIDE OF THE WINDOW THERE IS PART OF THE VEHICLE THAT IS A BLIND SPOT
THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS IN THE CAR
LEFT FRONT PILLAR IS TOO BIG I HAD 1 NEAR MISS WITH A PEDESTRIAN
I PHYSICALLY LOOK TO BOTH SIDES & BEHIND WHEN CHANGING LANES I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER TO SEE IF IT IS SAFE TO CHANGE I HAVE TO RELY ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS WHICH CAN CREATE A BLIND SPOT
REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE VERY SMALL RATHER LARGER BLIND SPOT THAN I VE HAD IN OTHER CARS
OVERALL GREAT VISIBILITY WITH LESSER VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR DUE TO SOME OBSTRUCTION FROM THE REAR HEADRESTS
I M REALLY HAPPY THAT THEY VE ADDED THE SUN VISOR EXTENDERS I HATED THAT MY JUKE DIDN T HAVE THEM SO WAS REALLY PLEASED THAT THEY VE SINCE ADDED THEM TO LATER MODELS
INABILITY TO ADJUST THE SEAT WELL HAVE A BIG BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER S SIDE FOR PEDESTRIANS
CAN BE HARD TO SEE BACKING UP CAMERA HELPS
VISIBILITY TO THE LEFT FRONT AND REAR RIGHT IS TOUGH
SUN VISORS ARE VERY THICK AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO CLIP ON ITEMS SUCH AS GARAGE DOOR OPENERS AND SUNGLASSES HOLDERS
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE ADDITIONAL OF LASERS SENSORS FOR SENSING VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES AS WELL AS FOR FRONT COLLISION AVOIDANCE AND BRAKING
GOING AROUND CURVES I BOB AND WEAVE MY HEAD LIKE I M WATCHING A PING PONG MATCH THE FRONT WINDOW STRUT IS INCREDABLY HARD TO SEE AROUND I VE NEVER DRIVEN ANYTHING WITH SUCH BAD BLIND SPOTS AND THERE IS ONE ON EACH SIDE OF THE CAR BOTH EQUA
BLIND SPOT ON SIDES
BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY ON BOTH SIDES HAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
THE FRONT LEFT AND RIGHT CORNER BLIND SPOTS ARE A LITTLE WORRISOME AT TIMES BUT EVERY CAR HAS THOSE BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOTS NEAR SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
LOT OF BLIND SPOTS FROM THE SIDE OF VEHICLE AND FRONT SIDES
TRULY GREAT VISIBILITY OVERALL I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE CAMERA 360 VIEW IN BACK UP IS SO AWESOME ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT
LANE KEEPING LANE DEPARTURE COLLISION AVOIDANCE AWD BLIND SPOT WARNING WOULD ALL BE IMPORTANT FEATURES TO INCLUDE
MURANO IS A BIG VEHICLE WITH BLIND SPOTS BACK UP CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT MONITOR SYSTEM ARE BIG HELP WELL DESIGNED
ONE REASON WE BOUGHT THE MURANO WAS BECAUSE OF ITS SAFETY FEATURES
XENON HEADLIGHTS WOULD BE GREAT OPTION
THERE IS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT TO THE FRONT RIGHT AND LEFT BECAUSE OF THE FRAME AROUND THE MIRROR AND WINDOW
SOMETIMES LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER FROM THE DRIVER SEAT I FEEL I CAN T SEE BEHIND AND TO THE SIDE OF ME AS WELL AS I WOULD LIKE NOTE THE SAFETY WARNINGS REALLY HELP WITH THIS
I BELIEVE IT HAS FEWER BLIND SPOTS THAT ANY OTHER CAR I VE OWNED GOOD WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT AND MAKING A SHARP TURN SUCH AS INTO MY DRIVEWAY THE AREA BEING APPROACHED IS VERY POORLY LIT BAD
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE AWKWARD TO LOOK INTO VISIBILITY COULD BE BETTER
I REGARD THE INSTANT RESPONSE AND ACCELERATION OF THE ELECTRIC DRIVE AS A SAFETY FEATURE FOR ONE THING IT HELPS A LOT ON THE SHORT ON RAMPS WE HAVE ON FREEWAYS IN HAWAII
THERE ARE LARGE BLIND SPOTS WHERE THE FRONT ROOF SUPPORTS ARE EITHER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD THE READ WINDOW IS RATHER SMALL REDUCING THE AREA ONE CAN SEE BEHIND THE CAR THERE SHOULD BE BACKUP REAR PROXIMITY SENSORS IN ADDITION TO THE CAMERA
IT IS REALLY HARD TO SEE THROUGHG THE VERY SMALL SLANTED WINDOWS ION THE BACK I FEEL THAT I HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAUTIOUS WITH BLIND SPOTS I THINK THIS IS A FLAW IN DESIGN
SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD HAVE SECONDARY MIRROR TO VISUALIZE BLIND SPOT ON EACH SIDE
THE WIDTH OF THE ROOF POSTS FEELS A LITTLE RESTRICTIVE OF VISIBILITY
REALLY ENJOY THE CAMERA FOR BACKING OUT
THE FRAME ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS TOO WIDE CREATES QUITE A BLIND SPOT I HAVE TO LEAN FORWARD AND BACK IN ORDER TO BE SURE
SUNLIGHT AT CERTAIN ANGLES CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO READ INTERIOR GAUGES PASSENGER SIDE FRONT WIPER FOLLOWS DRIVER SIDE WIPER AND SMEARS THE DRIVER SIDE FRONT VIEW
THE BLIND SPOT LIGHT IS SO HELPFUL AND NOT OBTRUSIVE LIKE BEEPS OR OTHER NOISES WOULD BE
TOO MANY SIDE VIEW BLIND SPOTS PULLING AWAY FROM DIAGONAL PARKING SPOT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IN REGARDS TO VISIBILITY
FOLD DOWN SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE OUTSTANDING AND HELPFUL WHEN BACKING UP SO IS THE CAMERA SYSTEM IN ALL ASPECTS OF DRIVING
BUMP ON THE CLOSER EDGE OF THE HOOD IS TOO VISIBLE FROM THE DRIVER POSITION IT LOOKS BAD FROM THE INSIDE
LED HEADLIGHTS COME ON ALREADY
WINDSHIELD WIPERS OVER LAP TO FAR LEAVING WATER FROM THE RIGHT WIPER IN THE DRIVERS EYESIGHT
DIRECT REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR BUT TECHNOLOGY FEATURES MIRRORS BLIND SPOT WARNING CAMERAS MAKE UP FOR IT THE CAMERAS ARE AMAZING
POOR VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING TO LOOK BEHIND YOU
THE SIDE VISIBILITY IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE DOWN TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE NOT TURNING TO SHARP TO HIT A CURB
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
LOVE THE REAR CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT NOTIFICATION
AGAIN WHEN BACKING UP I DO NOT NEED TO SEE THE GROUND BESIDE EACH REAR TIRE MAKES NO SENSE AND I HAVE TO CROUCH DOWN TO SEE WHAT IS BEHIND ME YES I HAVE A BACKUP CAMERA BUT THOSE GOOFY MIRRORS JUST THROW ME OFF AND I HATE IT
VISIBILITY AND SAFETY ARE MOST ENHANCED BY THE 360 DEGREE VIEW FROM ABOVE WHEN REVERSING OR PULLING IN TO A PARKING SPACE I RESEARCHED THIS PURCHASE ASSIDUOUSLY AND DID NOT FIND A COMPARABLE FEATURE LIKE THIS FROM OTHER MANUFACTURERS
ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE LIKED THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM TO HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ON THE SV TRIM I DO APPRECIATE THE LONG RANGE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS
THE VEHICLES VISIBILITY IS ENHANCED BY THE ELECTRONIC BLIND SPOT DETECTORS FORWARD AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT
DID NOT REALIZE THE POOR VISIBILITY WHEN TEST DRIVING WHEN TAKING A LEFT TURN THE MIRROR CAN BLOCK AN ENTIRE CAR FROM MY VIEW THANK GOD FOR THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING
FOR SOME STRANGE REASON THE PATHFINDER DOES NOT HAVE A LANE WARNING FEATURE LIKE MY OLD MURANO THIS IS AN IDEAL SAFETY FEATURE WHICH CAN WARN THE DRIVER WHEN HE IS GETTING DISTRACTED BY ALL THE ELECTRONIC DEVICES
THE CRASH TEST RESULTS ARE APPALLING FOR A VEHICLE THAT IS DESIGNED FOR FAMILIES THE SMALL OFFSET CRASH TEST MAKES ME SICK IF WE DIDN T LOVE OUR PREVIOUS QUEST VAN SO MUCH I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ANOTHER MAKE SIMPLY FOR THIS ISSUE ALONE
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS
FRONT SIDE WINDOW CREATES BLIND SPOT THE SMALL TRIANGLE WINDOW IN FRONT OF MAIN WINDOW
FEEL VERY SECURE IN THE PAST I JUST TO HIT ALL THE SIDEWALKS AND EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE OF POOR VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANE ARE TERRIBLE LIMITED VISIBILITY DUE TO SMALL SIDE WINDOWS FROM TRUNK
THE FACTORY INSTALLED WIPER BLADES STREAKED SIGNIFICANTLY ON FIRST USE IMMEDIATELY REPLACED WITH AFTERMARKET BLADES THAT NOW WORK AMAZINGLY WELL
LOVE THE ALL AROUND MONITOR CAMERA SYSTEM
THE HEAD REST FOR THE 3RD ROW SEATING CAN BLOCK VISIBILITY WHEN IN THE UPRIGHT POSITION
LOVE THE FEEL OF THE QUEST MY HUSBAND DID PUT BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON SIDE MIRRORS THAT REALLY HELP AVOID OTHER VEHICLES
I REMOVED THE RIGHT REAR HEADREST TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT THIS ISSUE WITH NISSAN IS STILL NOT ADDRESSED WELL AND WE LOVE THE ROGUE EXCEPT FOR THIS PROBLEM
BLIND SPOT IN TURNING LEFT
PASSENGER WIPER NOT CLEARING ENOUGH SNOW OFF WINDSHIELD COULD BE A LITTLE LONGER SO NOT TO LEAVE BLIND SPOT
SECOND AND THIRD ROW SEAT HEADRESTS LIMIT REAR VISIBILITY
LANE DEPARTURE WARNING AND BLIND SPOT WARNING ARE A BIG PLUS
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR
BIGGEST VISIBILITY PROBLEM IS TRYING TO SEE WHERE THE FRONT WHEELS ARE WHEN MANEUVERING IN PARKING LOTS WORSE AT NIGHT BLIND SPOTS ARE WORRISOME IN TRAFFIC
BLIND SPOT CIRCULAR MIRRORS BUILT IN WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IN HEAVY TRAFFIC
CAE HAS BLIND SPOTS CAN T SEE OUT BACK WINDOW
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE A LITTLE SMALL AND CREATE A HUGE BLIND SPOT I GOT SOME OF THOSE MIRROR THINGS THAT YOU ADD TO IT AND THAT HELPED A LOT
SHOULD HAVE A SPLIT SIDE MIRROR SYSTEM GLUING A SPOT MIRROR ON FOR LANE CHANGING VISIBILITY IS NOT A FOR EVERYBODY
I WOULD EXPAND ABOUT AN EANCH ON EACH SIDE THE UPPER REAR MIRROR WITH A POP OUT CURVE SHAPE FOR BETTER VISIBILITY RANGE
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO LOOK BEHIND TO CHANGE LANES MANY TIMES I HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE AND WATCH WHAT IS COMING UP TO THE SIDES OF THE CARS A DECENT DEAL BEFORE THE VEHICLE IS NEXT TO MINE
VISIBILITY IS THE BEST IN ANY CAR I HAVE DRIVEN
VISIBILITY IS GOOD AND NOT A PROBLEM
NEED TO ADD MIRROR DISKS TO SIDE MIRROS TO SEE VECHICLES ON EITHER SIDE OF CAR IN BLIND SPOT
I LIKE THE VISIBILITY OF THE VEHICLE I DON T LIKE HOW IT HANDLES AT 60 AND ABOVE
SLIGHT BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE TOWARD REAR DRIVERS SIDE OF VEHICLE
VISIBILITY OR THE AMOUNT OF VIEWING FOR THE DRIVER IS EXCEPTIONAL AND COMBINES WITH THE INTERIOR ROOMINESS FEEL TO MAKE DRIVING A PLEASURABLE EXPERIENCE BECAUSE YOU DO NOT FEEL CONFINED OR CONSTRICTED
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CAR AT LEAST TWICE I HAVE NEARLY RAN INTO A CAR IN THE BLIND SPOTS
370Z HAS BLIND SPOTS AS DID THE 350Z ALSO BUT THE DRIVER CAN ADJUST AND USE THE AIDS PROVIDED
I DON T LIKE THE REFLECTION OF THE CAR S INTERIOR IN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WHEN LIGHT HITS IT FROM OUTSIDE IT DIMINISHES VISIBILITY DON T KNOW IF THERE S ANYTHING TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS
WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD TO SEE IN YOUR BLIND SPOTS YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING UNLIKE OTHER CARS WHERE IT S DIFFICULT
SMALL BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVER S SIDE LOOKING TO RIGHT REAR
THE HID HEADLIGHTS AND THE WIDE ANGLE ARE LIKE DAYTIME VISION LOVE LOVE
NAVAGATION SCREEN HARD TO READ WHEN SUN IS SHINNING ON IT
WHY DOESN T THE BACK UP CAMERA BEEP WHEN THE CAR IS APPROCHING AN OBJECT IT SEEMS THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN AUDIBLE WARNING
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT REAR PASSENGER SIDE AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT HAVE A VERY FAST SPEED FOR DOWNPOUR RAIN
VISIBILITY TOWARD THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE IS LIMITED ONE OF MY REQUIREMENTS WHEN SHOPPING WAS THE REAR VIEW CAMERA FOR BACKING
THE WAY THE REAR IS CONSTRUCTED THE SIDE PANELS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT WHEN REVERSING AND CAUSE A LARGE BLIND SPOT AFTER SOME DRIVING YOU DO GET USED TO THIS
I WOULD REALLY LIKE SOME FOG LIGHTS ESPECIALLY LED HEADLIGHTS AND FOG LIGHTS ALSO LED TAIL LAMPS AND LED REAR SIGNAL LAMPS
BACK UP CAMERA IS GREAT JUDGING BACKING DISTANCE WITHOUT IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT
I WAS A PREVIOUS OWNER OF A NISSAN ALTIMA WHEN I HAD A HEAD ON COLLISION IN JANUARY MY NISSAN ALTIMA WAS DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS AND THE SAFETY OF THAT VEHICLE WAS JUST IMPECCABLE I WAS VERY THANKFUL FOR WALKING AWAY FROM THE COLLI
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE A VEHICLE WHEN MERGING LANES THERE IS A TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT AREA SURROUNDING THE VEHICLE
I AM STILL GETTING USED TO MY NEW CAR BUT VISIBILITY SEEMS TO BE VERY GOOD
EYESIGHT SYSTEM IS VERY EFFECTIVE
I CAN T SEE OUT MY BACK WINDOW AND THAT S REASON ENOUGH FOR ME NOT TO RECOMMEND THE CAR TO ANYONE IT IS SLANTED UPWARD WAY TOO MUCH THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A NICE ADDITIONAL FEATURE BUT I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RELY ON IT
THE ADDITION OF THE FORWARD SIDE WINDOWS ON THE DOOR IS WELCOME FOR VISIBILITY
THE MAIN DECIDING FACTOR FOR ME TO BUY THE CAR WAS THE FEELING OF SAFETY
WINDSHIELD WIPERS DON T WORK VERY WELL THEY SEEM TO FIGHT EACH OTHER
SUBARU HAS NO COMPETITION IN VEHICLE VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT
THE ONLY OTHER VEHICLE I VE DRIVEN THAT IS AS DRIVER FRIENDLY INCREDIBLE VISIBILITY WITH NO OBSTRUCTIONS SOLID SAFE AND SECURE ETC IS MY WIFE AND MY IMPREZA
LOVE THE VISABILITY EASY TO MANEUVER CAR AND I LOVE ALL SAFETY FEATURES
WISH FRONT PASSENGER SEAT COULD BE RAISED I AM 5 FT TALL AND WORRY ABOUT BEING INJURED BY FRONT AIRBAGS
THE EYESIGHT TECHNOLOGY IS EFFECTIVE EASY TO USE BRILLIANT
THE FRONT WIPER BLADES ALWAYS LEAVES A LINE OF WATER ON THE WINDSHIELD THAT HINDERS WITH YOUR VISIBILITY
THE VISIBILITY IS GOOD HAVING BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS VERY HELPFUL IN CHANGING LANES IT SHOULD BE STANDARD IN ALL CARS IT ALSO HAS REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT WHICH IS GREAT IN PARKING LOTS ALL WHEEL DRIVE IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT FEATURE TO HAVE
THIS CAR HAS EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON DRIVER S SIDE
VISIBILITY OUT OF REAR VIEW MIRROW IS SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED BY THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS AND WIDTH OF THE REAR WINDOW REAR ROOF PILLARS COULD POSSIBLY BE SMALLER SIDE MIRRORS ARE CLOSER TO THE DRIVER THAN MY PREVIOUS CAMRY MAKING ME HAVE TO AC
COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IS AMAZING
THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY USEFUL AND THE VIEW IS BROADER AS COMPARED TO MY HUSBANDS PRIUS BACK UP CAMERA
GREAT VISIBILITY AND THE CAR HAS A GREAT SAFETY RATING
I FEEL SO SAFE DRIVING MY SUBARU I LOVE ALL THE SAFETY FEATURES
THERE SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE NO BLIND SPOTS
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS
HARD TO SEE VEHICLES BEHIND WITH HIGH SEATS BLOCKING THE VIEW BUT THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR HELPS
SEEMS TO BE A BIT MORE OF A RIGHT REAR BLIND SPOT WHEN COMPARED TO MY OUTBACK
THE NEW SPEED CONTROL AND AUTO BRAKING W  THE EYE SIGHT IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL AND GIVE CONFIDENCE OF SAFETY
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A FRONT BUMPER PROXIMITY ALARM FOR PULLING INTO AND MANEUVERING INTO PARKING SPACES
KNOWING THAT COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IS ACTIVE AND ONE OF THE BEST AVAILABLE GIVES ME A FEELING OF SECURITY THAT IS WORTH MORE THAN THE INITIAL COST OF THE OPTION
I SWITCHED TO A SUBARU BECAUSE OF THE SUBARU S REPUTATION FOR SAFETY AND RELIABILITY
I DISLIKE HOW OFTEN THE CAMERA SYSTEM BEEPS TO TELL YOU OF A LANE DEPARTURE ESPECIALLY WHEN MERGING ONTO A FREEWAY I DON T LIKE THE RED LIGHT ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR INDICATING THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL I KNOW I CAN TURN IT OFF BUT IT SHOULD STAY
XENON HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE AN OPTION AS SHOULD A RAIN SENSOR FOR THE FRONT WIPERS
REAR LIGHTS WHEN BACKING UP AT NIGHT ARE POOR CAMERA IS LESS VISIBLE IN THE DARK AT NIGHT ESPECIALLY WITH SNOW ON THE GROUND AND UNFAMILIAR LOCATION
OVERALL I CONSIDER THE DRIVING AND SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE TO BE SAFE AND OFFER VERY GOOD VISIBILITY PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT I HAVE ONLY HAD THE VEHICLE FOR ABOUT THREE MONTHS
I WOULD LIKE ASSISTANCE WITH THE BLIND SPOT
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES THAT I AM NOW ADJUSTING TOO BUT SCARY WHEN YOU ARE NOT USED TO DRIVING THE VEHICLE
PASSENGER SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER IS INEFFECTIVE WHEN SNOWING ICE AND SLUSH BUILDUP WHEN DRIVING
I LOVE MY EYESIGHT PROGRAM
SUN VISORS ARE TOO SHORT IN LENGTH IT WOULD BE GREAT IF IT HAD AN ADDED EXTENSION FEATURE TO EXTEND THE LENGTH OF THE VISOR I DO LIKE THE FORWARD VISIBILITY BECAUSE I AM SHORT
MOST VISIBILITY OF ALL VEHICLES I LOOKED AT
WARNING FOR BLIND SPOT IS GREAT TO HAVE BUT THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT IS KIND OF HARD TO SEE DEPENDING ON THE LIGHTING OF THE DAY OUTSIDE
WITHOUT REAR CAMERA IT WOULD BE HARD TO SEE WHILE BACKING UP
VISIBILITY MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OTHER VEHICLE I HAVE DRIVEN
DRIVER SEAT HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT NEEDS TO GO HIGHER TO ALLOW FOR MAXIMUM VISIBILITY
LANE DEPARTURE ICON IN THE MIRROR IS A JOKE IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WHEN LIT UP NEEDS TO BE DIFFERENT COLOR OR LOCATION ON THE MIRROR
LED LIGHTS
I DON T LIKE TRACTION CONTROL ON AT START UP
IF ONLY THE VISIBILITY WAS BETTER FOR CHANGING LANES I WOULD ADORE THIS CAR
I REALLY LIKE THE BACKUP CAMERA ON THE CENTER CONSOLE INSTEAD OF THE MIRROR
SAFETY WAS A MAIN TOP PRIORITY IN CHOOSING THIS VEHICLE ALL WHEEL DRIVE DRIVER VISIBILITY FROM ALL ANGLES VEHICLE CLEARANCE & DRIVERS SEAT HEIGHT IIHS TOP PICK SAFETY RATING AIRBAGS INCLUDING THE KNEE AIRBAGS
I FEEL LIKE THERE S A DRIVER S SIDE BLINDSPOT BUT OTHERWISE I REALLY LIKE THE VISIBILITY FROM THE VEHICLE
WISH THERE WAS AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS
THE FORWARD VISIBILITY OF SUBARUS ARE ONE OF THEIR MOST UNDERRATED FEATURES
I AM A SHORT PERSON 5 2 AND IT IS OFTEN HARD FOR ME TO SEE SAFELY OUT OF VEHICLES MY WRX HAS FANTASTIC VISIBILITY
I HAVE TROUBLE SOMETIMES SEEING CARS IN MY BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE I REALLY HAVE TO LOOK TO SEE OTHER CARS IN MY BLIND SPOT WHEN IM CHANGING LANES MINOR ISSUE I THINK JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE REALLY AWARE OF TRAFFIC AROUND YOU AND MA
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SITS LOW I FIND MY SELF LOOKING AROUND IT AT STOP SIGNS AND TRAFFIC LIGHTS
THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT TO THE DRIVERS REAR THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE ON HIGHWAY TRAFFIC
EXCELLENT INSURANCE HIGHWAY SAFETY REPORTS
NON XENON HEADLIGHTS ARE A BIT DULL WASHERS ALSO LEAVE A GAP ON THE LEFT SIDE
BLIND SPOT IT IS HARD TO SEE WHEN MERGING INTO TRAFFIC
THIS IS MY FIRST SUV AND REAR VISABILITY IS DIFFERENT THAN A SUDAN I M GETTING USE TO IT
THE CAR HAS A BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT SIDE YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES
I PREFER THE VISIBILITY TO MY PREVIOUS SUBARU DIFFERENT MODEL
I REALLY FEEL LIKE I DON T EVEN HAVE A BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS GREAT
LOVE THE SAFETY OF THIS VEHICLE THE WIPERS IN FRONT DON T GO AS FAST AS I WOULD EXPECT ON HIGH THE VISORS ARE A LITTLE TINY
I M USED TO SMALLER CARS AND BEING ABLE TO SEE OUT THE BACK BETTER WHILE PARALLEL PARKING NOT NECESSARILY A PROBLEM WITH THIS CAR AS MUCH AS WHAT I M USED TO REAR CAMERA HELPS EVEN THOUGH AT FIRST I DIDN T THINK IT WAS USEFUL
SAFETY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT REASONS WHY I SELECTED THE VEHICLE AND IT HAS LIVED UP TO THE PROMISES
VEHICLE IS GREAT FOR FIELD OF VISION I HAVE DRIVEN OTHER SPORT UTILITIES WHICH HAD LARGE BLIND SPOTS THE 4 RUNNER HAS NONE
NEED XENON OR LED HEADLIGHTS
SIDE MIRRORS ARE SMALLER THAN THE ONES ON MY 4RUNNER THEY PROVIDE LESS VISABILITY THAN THE LARGER MIRRORS BLIND SPOT MIRRORS WOULD HELP ALSO
AGAIN THE OUT OF BALANCE AND COMPARABILITY OF REAR VIEW CENTER MIRROR RELATIVE TO THE SIDE MIRRORS AND REAR VIEW CAMERA IS BAD
AT THE PRICE POINT OF THIS VEHICLE I AM THOROUGHLY DISAPPOINTED THAT MY SRD 4 RUNNER DOES NOT HAVE AND CAN NOT HAVE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS INSTALLED FURTHERMORE IT DOES NOT HAVE BACKUP SENSORS I FIND IT UNBELIEVABLE THAT I HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LARGER TAIL LIGHTS IN FUTURE 4RUNNERS PERHAPS A NARROW RED LED LIGHT BAR STRIP AT THE BASE OF THE TRUNK COULD BE INCORPORATED INTO FUTURE DESIGNS THIS WOULD AID IN VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING IN SNOWY MOUNTAIN CONDITIONS
I REALLY FEEL SAFE IN MY CAR I LOVE THE SOLIDNESS OF ITS BUILD AND THE REAR CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT ASSIST I FEEL MORE SECURE WITH THESE FEATURES
LOVE THE BLIND SIDE WARNING AND BACKING WARNING
DYNAMIC CRUISE CONTROL SLOWS WHEN NOTHING IN THE LANE IN FRONT
HARD TO SEE OUT OF BACK WINDOW TOTALLY DEPEND ON BACKUP CAMERA AND SIDE MIRRORS
HARD TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES IF A SHORT PERSON THERE IS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY WAS A TOP PRIORITY AND I AM VERY PLEASED WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE AVALON S VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING IN HEAVY HIGHWAY TRAFFIC
SUN VISORS THAT WOULD SLIDE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES NO MATTER HOW I ADJUST MIRROR
HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK OR TO THE SIDE OF THE CAR AND NOT SURE ABOUT THE LINES ON THE BACK UP CAMERA AS TO THE END OF THE CAR MAYBE I JUST NEED TO GET USE TO IT I DO LIKE THE BLIND SPOT AND CROSS TRAFFIC SAFETY DEVICES I DON T LIKE THE CAR BEI
REAR VIEW FROM DRIVERS HARD TO SEE
WE LOVE THE REAR CAMERA AND ACCOMPANYING BEEPS
BLIND SPOTS SEEM MORE PROMINENT THAN OTHER CARS I HAVE OWNED
LOVE BLIND SPOT MONITORING
STILL GETTING USED TO BACKING UP WITH EYES LOOKING AT MONITOR USING BACK UP CAMERA BACKING UP WITHOUT USING CAMERA IS HARD SINCE THERE IS NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF WHERE THE CAR ENDS
REAR MONITORING SYSTEM SHOULD PROVIDE SOME WARNINGS OTHER THAN CROSS TRAFFIC WHEN BACKING UP
I LIKE THE AUTOMATED VISIBILITY HELPERS
I REALLY DO LOVE THE VISIBILITY OFFERED WITH THIS CAR I CAN SEE CLEARLY IN THE FRONT AND BACK VIEWS
IT SHOULD COME STANDARD WITH BLIND SPOT INDICATORS SO I KNOW WHEN THERE ARE CARS IN ADJACENT LANES
GOOD VISIBILITY FOR SUV
WHEN BACKING OUT OF DRIVE WAY OR PARKING SPACE THE PASSENGER HEADREST IS A BILL BOARD THAT OBSTRUCTS YOU VIEW ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A PASSENGER AND PUT THERE HEAD INTO THE PICTURE
REAR WINDOW WIPER IS FLIMSY LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BREAK BEFORE 100 000 MILES AND DOESN T CLEAR WINDOW WELL DO NOT REDUCE REAR VISIBILITY ANY MORE THAN IT IS IT IS AT THE LOWER LIMIT OF BEING ADEQUATE
WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS CAR DUE TO POOR VISIBILITY ACCORDING TO TOYOTA ALL AVALONS ARE LIKE THIS AND THEY DONT HAVE ANY FIX FOR MY CAR THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING
CRASH AVOIDANCE LANE DEPARTURE AND REAR CAMERA CROSS ALERT SHOULD BE STANDARD IN ALL CARS
THE CAMRY HAD GREAT A GREAT VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS
REAR HEADRESTS INTERFERE WITH REAR VISIBILITY FOR SHORT DRIVER
BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT QUARTER
THE ONLY THING IS SIDE VISIBILITY OR CHANGING LANES
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AND THE CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT THEY ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AND HAVE GREATLY ENHANCED THE SAFETY OF MY DRIVING EXPERIENCE
THE CAR HAD A HIGH SAFETY RATING IN THE IIHS VEHICLE SAFETY RATINGS A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN CHOOSING THIS VEHICLE I FEEL SAFE WHEN DRIVING IT
I THINK VISIBILITY TO THE EXTERIOR IS REDUCED ON THE SIDES AND THIS DEFECT IS REDUCED WITH THE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS IN BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE MIRRORS BLIND SPOTS ARE ACCENTUATED AND IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES I HAD TO INSTALL CONVEX SAFETY MIRRORS I WONDER WHETHER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE FIXED
ONLY ABOUT BLIND SPOT FORWARD WHEN TURNING LEFT CAUSED BY L SIDE MIRROR POSSIBLY TOO CLOSE TO DOOR
BIG BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO BIG AND ARE HARD TO SEE AROUND WHEN TURNING ONTO ROADS WITH MEDIANS
REAR BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE AND WIPERS COULD SOMETIMES CLEAN DEBRIS BETTER BUT OVERALL I LOVE THE CAR
I HATE THAT WHEN I TURN MY BODY TO BACK UP I CANNOT SEE THE STREET I DO NOT LIKE TO RELY ON MY MIRRORS OR THE CAMERA THE WORST EVER THIS IS MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT
LITTLE TROOUBLE WITH A BLIND SPOT DRIVERS RIGHT
THERE S A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING TO THE RIGHT
THE REAR CAMERA IS A VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE
BACK UP CAMERA HARD TO SEE IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT HITTING THE SCREEN
WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN THE DRIVERS SIDE VIEW MIRROR OBSTRUCTS THE VISIBILITY
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE ENOUGH VISIBILITY BUT I ALSO FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO RELY HEAVILY ON MY BACK UP CAMERA THE THIRD ROW WINDOWS DON T OFFER MUCH VISIBILITY
REAR SEAT HEAD RESTRAINTS BLOCK SOME VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHILE DRIVING IS THE ONE FLAW IN THIS VEHICLE
WITH A CAR OF THIS SIZE AND IN THIS CLASS IT ABSOLUTELY SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT MONITORING
VERY LIMITED VISIBLY THROUGH THE BACK AND ESPECIALLY THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS MUST RELY ON THE SIDE MIRRORS HOWEVER THOSE MIRRORS ARE EXCELLENT SO THE ISSUE IS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED WE DO NEED TO GET USED TO THAT
DID NOT HAVE BLIND SPOT MONITORING AVALABLE
THE REAR VISIBILITY ISSUE IS WHAT I REFERENCED IN THE SEAT SECTION IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE NOT THAT THE REAR SEAT REST HAVE BEEN RAISED FROM MY MODEL
TYPICAL SUV BLIND SPOTS WIDE A PILLARS
VEHICLE FEELS VERY SOLID AND WELL BUILT HIGHWAY RIDE IS SURPRISINGLY COMFORTABLE VEHICLE HAS A SOLID SECURE FEEL TO IT AUDIO SYSTEM IS EXCEPTIONAL GOOD POWER FROM THE V 6 WISH THE TRANSMISSION HAD MANUAL SHIFT OPTION THAT IS NOW STANDARD ON MO
REALLY REALLY REALLY LOVE THE HEADROOM AND VISIBILITY
REAR VIEW CAM IS VERY HANDY
FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS OPERATE VERY WELL
I ADDED A 180 MIRROR TO SEE IN BLIND SPOT
CONVERTIBLE MODEL HAS VERY POOR REAR VISIBILITY
REAR VISIBILITY ISN T THAT GOOD BUT IT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR AN SUV AND YOU HAVE CAMERAS AND LANE CHANGE ASSIST TO HELP
GOOD IIHS RATING IS VERY IMPORTANT
VISIBILITY IS OVERALL EXCELLENT BUT REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS CAN PARTIALLY BLOCK REAR VIEW THIS IS ANNOYING WHEN I AM BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY AS I DO NOT WANT TO HIT A PEDESTRIAN SOMETIMES WHEN I AM CHANGING LANES TO MY LEFT I AM NOT SURE WHETHE
THE RADIO NAV SYSTEM IS INCONVENIENT TO OPERATE WHILE DRIVING STEERING WHEEL CONTROLS WOULD HELP FOR DRIVING SAFELY
AT CERTAIN TIMES OF THE DAY I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME SORT OF AN EXTENSION OF THE SUN VISOR TOWARD THE CENTER OF THE WINDOW TO COVER THE AREA BEHIND THE INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR
BLIND SPOT IS A LITTLE WORRISOME
IT SHOULD HAVE A BACK UP CAMERA AS A STOCK FEATURE
NEEDS BACKUP CAMERA DUE TO CONVERTIBLE TOP POOR REAR VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOTS SEEM A LITTLE LARGER BUT MAY BE BECUASE OF A MOVE FROM A COMPACT TO AN SUV
THE SIDE MIRRORS NEED TO BE IMPROVED TO INCREASE VISIBILITY
I AM VERY TALL 7FT AND VISIBILITY IS SUPERIOR I LOVE THE VEHICLE AND WOULD NEVER TRADE IT IN I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE VEHICLE TO ANYONE I SPEAK TOO SINCERELY LANCE SCOTT
GREAT HEADLIGHTS I DO HAVE TO BE VIGILANT WITH MY BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES THAT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO OTHERWISE I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS
WARNING SIGNALS SHOULD GET LOUDER WHEN RADIO ON I LIKE WINDSHIELD WIPERS OF SAME SIZE
WOULD LIKE AN INDICATOR THAT SHOWS IF EYESIGHT IS ON OR NOT
BLIND SPOT IN BACK REAR PANEL AND WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES
DID NOT GET TINTED WINDOWS SO WE COULD HAVE GREATEST VISIBILITY
LOVE THE VISIBILITY
THE SMALL WINDOWS ON THE FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDES REALLY INCREASE VISIBILITY
REAR HEAD RESTS OBSTRUCT VISIBILITY
HAVE DIFFICULTY PARKING BECAUSE I CAN T SEE WHERE THE FRONT HOOD IS IN RELATION TO THE ROAD OR PARKING SPACE
THE SUN VISORS SHOULD HAVE EXTENDERS THAT CAN BE USED WHEN TURNED TO THE SIDE THEY SHOULD ALSO COME DOWN A LITTLE LOWER THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHERE THE FRONT WINDOW ATTACHED TO THE LITTLE WINDOW ON THE SIDES
SOME DIFFICULTY SEEING CARS ON DRIVER S SIDE DRIVER BLIND SPOT ON LEFT AND I CAN T FIGURE OUT WHY
I FIND THE LOCATION OF THE REAR IN CABIN LIGHT AND THE HEADRESTS FOR THE BACK SEATS SOMETIMES IMPEDE VISIBILITY
NOT REALLY VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING IS SO IMPORTANT TO SAFE DRIVING WHETHER OUT IN THE COUNTRY OR IN A CROWDED CITY WE HAVE HAD ONLY GOOD EXPERIENCES
TOYOTA PRIUS V IS BEYOND TRULY EXCEPTIONAL IT S MODERN TECHNOLOGY IS BEYOND ANYTHING I VE SEEN OR ENCOUNTERED ALL I CAN SAY IS THIS CAR IS WORTH THE BUY WITH IT S FINE SEATS AND MODERN TECH AH IN CONCLUSION THIS CAR IS VERY WORTH IT I
RIGHT SIDE BLIND SPOT PARTICULARLY BAD REALLY NEED TO ADJUST RIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR TO COVER SPOT SUN VISORS WHEN USED ON THE SIDE WINDOW WAY TOO SHORT
BACKUP CAMERA IS NEW FOR ME WOULD BE NICE IF YOU COULD SEE SCREEN DURING DAY  MAYBE TILTING IT A SMIDGE TOWARD THE DRIVER MIGHT HELP
IT IS EXTREMELY EASY TO DRIVE BOTH AROUND TOWN AND ON THE HIGHWAY THE VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD
MOST OF MY DRIVING IS IN CITY TRAFFIC DUE TO EXCELLENT VISIBILITY I FEEL SAFER CHANGING LANES AND DEFENSIVE DRIVING
SIDE MIRRORS CREATE REAL BLIND SPOT
IN OUR NEW SEQUOIA THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT OUT THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THE BACK PASSENGER HEADREST ON THE 3RD ROW SEATS BLOCKS THE BACK WINDOW WHEN CHANGING LANES THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS ON THIS NEW VEHICLE EVEN ON
REAR WIPER NEEDS TO BE REDESIGNED BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CLEAR ENOUGH OF THE BACK WINDOW
WE CONSTANTLY LOOK UP SAFETY RATING SYSTEMS AND CONSUMER REPORTS WHEN PURCHASING VEHICLES AND TOYOTA IS ALWAYS RANKED BETWEEN 1 AND 2 IN SAFETY THAT IS OUR BIGGEST THING WHEN WE BUY VEHICLES ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE A FAMILY NOW
IF I DIDN T HAVE THE REAR CAMERA I WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH REAR VISIBILITY HENCE MY 6 RATING WITH THE REAR CAMERA I WOULD GIVE IT A 9
IT TOOK A BIT TO GET USED TO BUT LIKING THE DUAL VISION SIDE MIRRORS AND LOVING THE BACK UP CAMERA
THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR IS A BLIND SPOT FOR ME WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN I HAVE TO RAISE MYSELF UP FROM THE SEAT IN ORDER TO SEE OVER THE MIRROR
LIMITED VISIBILITY OUT OF REAR WINDOW FROM REAR VIEW MIRROR
REAR VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE LARGER SO YOU CAN SEE OTHER VEHICLES
THE SIDE MIRROR BLIND SPOT IS HUGE DOUBLE MIRROR NEEDS SOME GETTING USE TO A BLIND SPOT SENSOR SHOULD COME STANDARD
MY VISIBILITY ISSUES RELATE TO MY SMALL STATURE AT 4 8 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OVER THE HOOD I HAD TO ADD PEDAL EXTENDERS TO GET FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE AIRBAG I WOULD LIKE TO SIT HIGHER IN THE SEAT BUT HAVE NO WAY TO DO SO
I LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA
WE HAVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND CROSS NAVIGATION WHEN BACKING UP THEY BOTH ARE EXCELLENT FEATURES
THINK ABOUT ADDING THE CURVED MIRRORS ON EITHER SIDE TO ELIMINATE NOT SEEING VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOTS
ALL THE 2015S I TEST DROVE HAVE THE BACKUP CAMERA WHICH I DID NOT HONESTLY WANT BUT HAS PROVEN TO BE AN OUTSTANDING FEATURE WHICH I USE EVERY TIME I BACK UP I DROVE A RUBICON AND WAS EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED WITH THE POOR VISIBILITY OUT ALL SIDES
IMPROVE VISIBILITY
ALL TACOMA S HAVE A NASTY BLIND SPOT WHEN DRIVING THIS IS MY SECOND AND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE
MIRRORS ARE A PAIN TO SEE VEHICLES IN BLIND SPOT
SHOULD HAVE WIDE ANGLE BLINDSPOT MIRRORS BUILT INTO MAIN SIDE MIRRORS THIS SHOULD BE WRITTEN INTO LAW BY NOW
OF COURSE IT IS A TRUCK SO VISIBILITY TO THE REAR WILL BE LIMITED
SIDE VISIBILITY BLIND SPOT IS SOMETIMES A PROBLEM
REAR SEAT HEADREST BLOCK VISIBILITY EVEN WHEN FOLDED DOWN
EXCELLENT SAFETY FEATURES
REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS REALLY HELPFUL AS A TRUCK DRIVER WHO BACKS UP WITH MIRRORS I NEVER REALIZED WHAT A BIG HELP AND SAFETY FEATURE THE BACK UP CAM IS
BLIND SPOT NEEDS ADDRESSED I NEARLY CLIPPED A CAR DRIVING ON INTERSTATE DID NOT SEE HIM ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
WITH THE TOW MIRRORS THE RIGHT MIRROR HAS A BLIND SPOT WHERE A STANDARD SIZE VEHICLE CAN NOT BE SEEN
LOOKING TO THE RIGHT WHEN BACKING UP AND PULLING FORWARD FROM A STOP HAVE BLIND SPOTS CAUSED BY THE DOOR PANELS
HEADLIGHT SHOULD BE ADJUSTED PRIOR TO DELIVERY
FEELS VERY SAFE W  A TON OF AIRBAGS
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FOR DRIVER WITH THIS VEHICLE THE ADDITION OF THE SMALL LANE CHANGE MIRRORS ON THE REGULAR FRONT DOOR MIRRORS IS A GREAT SAFETY FEATURE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS ALMOST VERTICAL AND WITH NO SHIELD FROM THE SUN NEEDS TO BE INDENTED INTO THE DASHBOARD SO IT CAN BE SEEN MORE CLEARLY
BLIND SPOT PROBLEMS WITH THIS VENZA SIMILAR TO OTHER VENZA WE OWNED NOT BIG FAN OF THE WIDE ANGLE MIRROR ATTACHJED TO THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TAKING A LOT OF TIME TO GET USED TO
HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES IF SOMEONE IS BEHIND YOU THERE IS A BLIND SPOT OVER BOTH SHOULDERS
HAS BLIND SIDE MIRRORS WOULD PREFER BLIND SIDE MONITOR NOT AVAILABLE
I DON T LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
THE VEHICLE IS WELL BUILT AND YOU HAVE A FEELING OF SAFETY IT SEEMS TO HANDLE ROUGH ROADS PRETTY WELL A LOT BETTER THEN THE CADILLAC ATS
WOULD HAVE LOVED THE BLIND SIDE ALERT I VE HAD NECK FUSION AND ITS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TURN MY HEAD AROUND THE WAY I USED TO I USE MY MIRRORS A LOT
REAR WIPER BLADE SHOULD BE LONGER
BLISS SHOULD BE STANDARD
SIDE MIRRORS AND DISTRACTING CONVEX INSERT DO NOT GIVE LARGE ENOUGH VIEW TO CONFIDENTLY USE TO SEE BLIND SPOTS
THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS CREATE A DIFFICULT REAR VIEW FOR MY SHORTER SPOUSE
I LOVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
THE BLIND SPOTS OVER MY SHOULDERS ARE BAD
POOR VISIBILITY BECAUSE OF THE BACK SEAT BELTS
IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE THE LEFT REAR SIDE WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE
ITS DIFFICULT BACKING UP POOR VISIBILITY WHILE LOOKING OVER YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER I HAD TO INSTALL A REAR VIEW CAMERA
THE LARGE FORWARD SLOPING WINDSHIELD SUPPORTS RESULT IN A VERY BAD BLIND SPOT AT THE 2 00 TO 3 00 POSITION WHEN AT A STOP SIGN
DUE TO THE SMALL WIDTH OF THE CAR THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS TOO SMALL AND THAT GIVES BLINDSPOTS
REAR VIEW BLIND SPOTS ARE NUMEROUS BUT TOLERABLE AND AS EXPECTED IN A SPORTS CAR
LARGER BLIND SPOTS THAN NORMAL AT THE DRIVER S 7 AND 4 O CLOCK
WIDE C PILLAR AREA CREATES A BLIND SPOT TO PASSENGER REAR AREA OF VEHICLE
RIGHT AND LEFT REAR CORNER BLIND SPOTS UNLESS YOU ADJUST THE SIDE MIRRORS CORRECTLY
THERE IS A DRIVERS SIDE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
NO DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS AND NO BACKUP CAMERA OR BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS UNACCATABLE
SMALL REAR WINDSHIELD COMBINED WITH WINDOW TINTING CAN MAKE REAR VISIBILITY POOR AT NIGHT
THE REAR BLIND SPOTS OF THE VEHICLE ARE LARGE
BACK WINDOW WINDSHIELD WIPER
BLIND SPOT VIEW COULD BE IMPOROVED
HAS A SERIOUS BLIND SPOT TO THE REAR BUT I HAVE OVERCOME THAT WITH ATTACHED SMALL OUTSIDE MIRRORS
NOT SO GOOD IF YOU ARE SHORT THE BACK WINDOWS ARE REALLY HARD TO CHECK BLIND SPOTS
LIKE AND USE BACK UP CAMERA
BLIND SPOTS DUE TO WINDOW SHAPE SIDE REAR
THE SPLIT REAR WINDOW HAMPERS REAR VISIBILITY AND TAKES GETTING USED TO
THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I HAVE AND IT IS A MINOR ONE IS THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
THE SUN VISORS ARE TO SHORT AND I DONT LIKE THAT THE BACK UP CAMERA DOES NOT HAVE THE LINES LIKE THE TUNDRA
REAR VIEW IS TERRIBLE
REAR VISIBILITY IS AWFUL WITH THE SPLIT WINDOW
THE VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR VIEW WINDOW IS NOT AS GOOD AS I WOULD LIKE
BETTER REAR VISIBILITY WOULD BE NICE
RIGHT WINDSHIELD POST CREATES A DANGEROUS BLIND SPOT
WHEN [PARKING THE FRONT END OF CAR IS NOT VISIBLE NEEDS A FRONT CAMREA OR MSOME SORT OF ANTENNA TO LET ONE KNOW HOW CLOSE ONE MIGHT TO AQNY OBJECT S CARS ETC
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE SUFFICIENT EVEN WHEN SELECTED TO PARKING LIGHTS SO AT HIGH BEAMS THEY ARE TRULY EXCEPTIONAL THE REAR WINDOW IS VERY SMALL AND HAVING ELEVATED HEADRESTS MAKE THE REAR VIEW EVEN MORE POOR THE REAR WIPERS MOUNT IS POORLY POSITIO
BLIND SPOT CAN BE HARD TO PICK UP IF YOUR PAYING ATTENTION IN TRAFFIC
GREAT NEW FEATURE VS 12 MODEL IS THE LINES FOR DISTANCE ON BACK UP CAMERA
REAR HEADRESTS ARE A HAZARD TO VISIBILITY
HARD TO CHANGE LANES BECAUSE OF BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE
WHILE CHANGING LANES ON THE HIGHWAY I NEARLY HIT A VEHICLE THAT WAS IN MY BLIND SPOT I THINK ALL VEHICLES SHOULD COME WITH WARNING DEVICES TO AVOID COLLISIONS LIKE THIS FROM HAPPENING
BLIND SPOT IN REAR CORNERS
NO BLIND SPOT MONORITING
WHEN USING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THE REAR PASSENGER HEADRESTS BLOCK SIDE VIEWS SLIGHTLY
I WISH THE CAR HAD THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM AND TURN SIGNALS ON THE SIDE MIRRORS
SLIGHTLY LARGER SIDE MIRRORS OR LANE CHANGE WARNING WOULD BE HELPFUL
THERE IS MORE THAN ONE BLIND SPOT
MORE VISIBILITY REARWARD FOR CHANGING LANES
SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
MIRRORS HAVE DIFFICULTY COVERING BLIND SPOTS
I WISH THE REAR WIPER BLADES PULLED OUT MORE FULLY TO FACILITATE CLEANING THE REAR WINDOW
THE VISIBILITY FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS MISLEADING SOMETHING TO GET USE TO
THE REAR CAMERA IS FANTASTIC WISH I COULD HAVE GOTTEN BLIND SPOT WARNING SIGNALS AND OR SIDE VIEW CAMERAS IN THIS MODEL
REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT THE BEST YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY CAUTIOUS CAUSE OF THE BACK MIRROR ARE HIGH
THE HEAD RESTS ON THE PASSENGER SEATS IN THE BACK REALLY NEGATE MOST OF THE VISIBITY WITH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
SIDE REAR VIEW IS NOT ENOUGH
THE ONLY THING I FEAR IS THAT I M TOO SMALL FOR OTHER CARS TO SEE IF I M IN A BLIND SPOT
IT IS SOMEWHAT HARD TO SEE VEHICLES IN OTHER LANES WHEN LOOKING TO THE SIDE REAR BECAUSE OF BLIND SPOTS AND SMALL REAR WINDOWS IT IS ALS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES TO SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOW BECAUSE OF THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS I WISH THE VISORS EXTENDE
IT S A SMALL CAR VISIBILITY IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHAT LAX
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THAT MAKE ME NERVOUS ESPECIALLY WHEN CHANGING LANES OR PULLING INTO A TIGHT PARKING SPOT
BLIND SPOT ALERT WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED
LOVE THE VISABILITY
WISH IT HAD COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS SELF DRIVING FEATURES ASIDE FROM THAT I LOVE THE CAR S SOLID MECHANICS AND SPORTY DRIVEABILITY FEELS VERY MUCH LIKE A DRIVER S CAR EXCELLENT SUSPENSION AND EASILY CONTROLLED SAFE THE LED ADAPTIVE
FRONT VISIBILITY IS COMPROMISED AT TIMES DRIVER HAS TO BE ALERT BUT TO BE FAIR THAT IS THE RAISON D ETRE FOR A CAR LIKE THIS I E MAXIMIZING THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE
THE SIDE MIRRORS HAVE A VERY BAD BLIND SPOT I REALIZE THAT THIS IS DUE TO THE SHAPE STYLING AND I HAVE GOTTEN USED TO THEM BUT FOR SOME THIS MAY BE A BIG ISSUE
HEADLIGHTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT I THOUGHT THE BACK UP CAMERA WAS A GIMMICK BUT I VE INSTALLED ON ON MY 2001 GOLF
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE SINCE IT LEFT THE DEALER THERE IS A DECEIVING BLIND SPOT
THE CAR S FEEL WHILE DRIVING GIVES ME A SENSE OF SAFETY AND CONTROL COMBINED GREAT VISIBILITY COMFORTABLE NON FATIGUING DRIVING POSITION AND WELL LAID OUT CONTROLS FROM A DRIVER S PERSPECTIVE GIVES ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE WHILE DRIVING
SHOULD COME STANDARD WITH LED LIGHTING AT NO UP CHARGE
AFTER DRIVING A MINI VAN THAT IS HIGH OFF THE GROUND WITH GREAT VISIBILITY THE PASSAT IS A BIT OF AN ADJUSTMENT THE CAR HAS MORE BLIND SPOTS THAN MY VAN DID
BACKING CAMERA IS WONDERFUL FEATURE
I HAVE THE TURBO MODEL AND IT HAS THE MOST PEP OR POWER OF ANY TURBO MODEL I HAVE EVER OWNED FUN TO DRIVE WHILE STILL HAVING THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF A SEDAN
REAR VIEW CAMERA IS INEFFETIVE
CHANGING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT LANE HAS A BLIND SPOT AS EXPECTED WITH ALL HATCHBACK S VERY EASY TO OVERCOME WITH SIDE VIEW MIRROR ADJUSTMENT
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL WARNING SYSTEMS
REAR WINDSHIELD WIPERS WOULD IMPROVE VISIBILITY WOULD ALSO LIKE SIDE MIRRORS TO SHOW BLIND DPOT
ALL CARS SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH LANE CHANGE ASSIST TO WARN REGARDING VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT THIS IS TRUE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE DRIVER S EXPERIENCE
MY VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE DETECTORS FOR BLIND SPOTS
HEADLIGHTS COULD BE TWEAKED TO GET BETTER ROAD VISIBILITY I RUN MY FOG LIGHTS AT NIGHT TO GET BETTER VISIBILITY LED HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE THE NEXT CHANGE
I FIND THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHEN USING THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS I HAVE LEARNED TO ADJUST THEM FURTHER OUT TO COMPENSATE
PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT IS THAT THE HEADRESTS IN THE BACKSEAT TOTALLY OBLITERATE MY VIEW THERE IS ENOUGH OF A BAD BLINDSPOT WITHOUT THOSE HEADRESTS WHICH I HAVE REMOVED OF COURSE THEN YOU SEE ALL THE HOLES
I PERSONALLY FEEL THERE IS A RATHER LARGE BLIND SPOT
THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS IN THE VEHICLE
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING AT SIDE MIRROR TO CHANGE LANES I FINALLY PUT SPOT MIRRORS ON THE SIDE MIRRORS
REALLY BAD BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO SHIFT LANES TO THE RIGHT
FIND IT HAS BLIND SPOTS WHICH MAKES IT A BIT HARD TO CHANGE LANES
I DIDN T EVEN REALIZE IT WAS AN OPTION AT FIRST BUT THE CAR DETECTS WHEN I M TURNING LEFT OR RIGHT AND ADJUSTS THE HEADLIGHTS TOWARD THAT ANGLE THIS HAS GREATLY IMPROVED VISIBILITY GREAT FEATURE VW
REAR VISIBILITY FROM PASSENGER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR COULD BE BETTER
THE VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING FOR THE LEFT BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY PREVIOUS CAR THE PANEL BETWEEN FRONT DOOR & BACK DOOR COULD BE MADE NARROWER SOMEHOW TO PROVIDE MORE WINDOW VISIBILITY SPACE
THE REAR VIEW WINDOW CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF
THE HEADRESTS ARE A BLIND SPOT FOR ME
NEED BLIND SPOT MIRROR
I WILL NEVER TRUST THE REAR CAMERA
COLLISION AVOIDANCE OR SENSOR FOR BLIND SPOT
WISH THAT THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS HAD BLIND SPOT ABILITY TO SEE
THIS IS WHY I CHOSE THE CAR SUPERIOR VISIBILITY TO MOST NEW MODELS
LOVE THE FEELING OF SAFETY AND QUALITY
THE REAR CAMERA COULD BE BRIGHTER IN IT S DISPLAY WHEN BACKING UP IT IS POSITIONED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE HATCH AND APPEARS TO BE SHADED BY THE OVERHANG I WILL ASK THE SERVICE WRITER TO HAVE IT INSPECTED ON MY NEXT VISIT
REMARKABLY GOOD VISIBILITY
REARVIEW MIRROR NEEDS TO BE BIGGER FOR BETTER REAR VISIBILITY ITS A BIT SMALL FOR AN SUV
THE SIDEBAR BETWEEN THE FRONT & BACK SEATS AND THE FRONT SEAT HEADREST BLOCK A FAIR AMOUNT OF VISIBILITY ON THE RIGHT SIDE WHEN PULLING OUT OF AN INTERSECTION
I LOVE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR REFLECTION REACTION THIS CAR DOESN T HAVE HEADLIGHT WASHERS
I D LIKE TO HAVE AUTO ON HEADLIGHTS
I HAVE THE LED LIGHTS THEY ARE GREAT
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER SPRAY IS DIRECTED TO THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD IT SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO COVER MORE OF THE WINDSHIELD
THE SUN VISORS COULD BE LARGER OR PERHAPS AN ATTACHMENT THAT SLIDES DOWN WHEN MORE SHADE IS NEEDED THE BEEPING SYSTEM WHEN BLIS IS ON AS WELL AS WHEN APPROACHING AN OBJECT IN FRONT OR IN BACK IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL BUT STILL HAVE TO RELY ON LOO
THERE IS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVER TO THE THE RIGHT THE BLISS HELPS WITH THIS
I KNOW IT IS THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE BUT I DON T LIKE DRIVING DEPENDENT ON WARNING LIGHTS ETC
THERE ARE DEFINITELY BLIND SPOTS BUT THE CAR S ELECTRONIC BLIND SIDE DETECTION SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL TO HELP MINIMIZE THIS ISSUE
IT DID NOT COME WITH XENON HEADLIGHTS XENON ARE A LITTLE BRIGHTER
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE SIDE TINTED WINDOWS AT NIGHT
TWICE I HAVE ALMOST PULLED OVER ONTO A VEHICLE IN THE RIGHT LANE BECAUSE I COULD NOT SEE THEM IN THE RIGHT HAND MIRROR THIS IS EVEN WITH THE CHANGE LANE SAFETY FEATURE
ADAPTIVE CONTROL IS GREAT FOR INTERSTATE TRAVEL THE CITY SAFETY SYSTEM HAS ALREADY SAVED ME AT LEAST ONE FENDER BENDER
FOR A VEHICLE NOT TO HAVE AUTOMATED WINDSCREEN WIPERS NOR AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS IS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND I HAVE DRIVEN CHEAPER VEHICLES WHICH HAD THESE FUNCTIONALITIES
VOLVO IS THE BEST IN SAFETY
REAR HEADRESTS SLIGHTLY BLOCK VIEW OUT BACK WINDOW IN REAR VIEW MIRROR WOULD BE NICE IF REAR HEADRESTS COULD BE FOLDED OUT OF WAY WHEN NOT IN USE
GOOD OVERALL VISIBILITY
NICE TO DRIVE MY CAR KNOWING THAT WE ARE SAFER THAN SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THE ADDED OPTIONS OF THE LANE CHANGE FLASHERS SENSORS BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHTS PARK ASSIST HAS ALREADY HELPED ME AVOID SEVERAL COLLISSIONS
LOVE THE BLIS AND SENSORS AROUND VEHICLE FOR WARNING
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR TAKES SOME ADJUSTMENT TO GET USED TO IT IT SEEMED SMALL AND DARK AT FIRST NOW I VE ADAPTED TO IT BUT IT COULD BE IMPROVED BY BEING A BIT LARGER
ITS A SUV FRONT VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT HOWEVER I MUST RELY ON THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR TO TELL ME IF ANYTHING IS BELOW THE SIGHT LINE THE VEHICLE IS NEW ENOUGH THAT I DON T FULLY TRUST IT TO SEE ALL THE AREAS
BLIND SPOTS FROM DRIVER SEAT IS CONCERNING I LIKE THE FEATURE THAT CAN DROP THE BACKSEATS HEADRESTS I M GETTING USED TO DOUBLE TRIPLE CHECKING BUT WISH I HAD THE BLIND SPOT AVOIDANCE   LANE CHANGING SYSTEM
VISIBILITY THROUGH REAR SIDE WINDOWS CAN BE CHALLENGING
THE VEHICLE HAS STANDARD TRADITIONAL HEADLIGHTS NOT XENON OR LED
I WISH THE HEADLIGHTS WERE STANDARD XENON
DIFFICULT LOOKING OUT RIGHT WINDOW WITH PASSENGER DRIVER SUN VISOR ONLY EXTENDS STRAIGHT DOWN WON T STAY IN PLACE WHEN PUSH IT TO THE WINDOW THIS LIMITS VISIBILITY FORWARD
EXCELLENT OVERALL VISIBILITY THAT IS NOT ADVERSELY OBSTRUCTED BY ANY OF THE PILLARS
BLIND SPOTS ABOUND REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT AND MIRRORS DO NOT CAPTURE ALL TRAFFIC
BLIND SPOT IS DIFFICULT BUT ELECTRONIC ADVISING HELPS
BLIS FEATURE IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HEADLIGHT BEAM MOVEMENT ON TURNS IS QUITE HELPFUL
GREAT VISIBILITY
WHEN DRIVING UP AND HILL AND TURNING LEFT THE SIDE DRIVER S MIRROR BLOCKS VISIBILITY OF THE STREET I AM TURNING LEFT ON TO MY STREET SO THIS IS A DAILY OCCURRENCE
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM
REAR CAMERA DOES NOT SHOW LINES OR BEEP WHEN BACKING UP LOTS OF BLINDSPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
THERE SEEMS TO BE TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS
EVEN WITH THE TOP TRIM FOR THE TOYOTA PRIUS C THERE IS NO OPTION FOR AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS WITH A NEW TOP TRIM VEHICLE THIS SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE
WISH IT HAD BLIND SPOT INDICATORS AND LANE CHANGING INDICATORS ON EXTERIOR SIDE MIRRORS
VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE DRIVERS SIDE CAN BE CHALLENGING I AM NOT SURE IF IT IS MY HEIGHT OR THE SPACE BETWEEN THE DOORS THAT IS SOLID THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT AND I HAVE TO PHYSICALLY TURN SEVERLY TO THE LEFT TO MAKE SURE
WE BOUGHT THE CAR FOR THE SAFETY FEATURES AND THE CRASH TEST RATING WE HAVE TWO VOLVOS AND WONT BY ANY OTHER CARS MAINLY DUE TO THE FOCUS ON SAFETY THE STYLING IMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER INNOVATIONS IN RECENT YEARS ARE VERY WELCOME
THE DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT IS TERRIBLE WHEN THE TOP IS UP
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS THAT TAKE GETTING USED TO
WHEN ENTERING A ROAD FROM A JUGHANDLE BLIND SPOT IS VERY DIFFICULT
MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY THAT THE ORIGINAL PRIUS
OUTDATED HEADLIGHTS
I FEEL VERY SECURE IN THIS VEHICLE PART OF MY JOB IS INVESTIGATING ACCIDENTS FOR A LARGE CITY BUS COMPANY AND TEACH SAFETY TECHNIQUES TO NEW BUS DRIVERS AND SUPERVISORS I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE
I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN I AM LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW IN ORDER TO SEE WHEN I AM TURNING LEFT
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE A SHORT OR SMALL HORIZONTAL ILLUMINATION ZONE ON REGULAR INCREASES THE HEIGHT OF VISIBILITY ON HIGH BEAM
3RD ROW HEAD REST COULD BE LITTLE MORE SMALLER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
OUTSTANDING VISIBILITY
THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS AND YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN TURNING CHANGING LANES OR BACKING UP
BACK UP CAMERA IS GREAT
I REALLY WISH THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA HAD DISTANCE MARKINGS SOMETIMES IT S DIFFICULT TO TELL HOW CLOSE I AM TO THE VEHICLE BEHIND ME IF I M PARALLEL PARKING
RIGHT REAR WINDOW HAS BLIND SPOT
BECAUSE VIEW IS BLOCKED BY HEADREST VISIBILITY IS POOR OUT BACK WINDOW
THERE IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE REAR VISIBILITY
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS THE WORST FEATURE DUE TO A SMALL BACK WINDOW AND STRUCTURE OF CAR CREATES BLIND SPOTS WHICH IS HELPED A BIT BY THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS UNFORTUNATELY THESE ARE NOT ALWAYS ENTIRELY ACCURATE AND PULLS UP FALSE ALARMS
A BACKUP CAMERA WOULD BE NICE
SUN VISOR IS TOO SMALL TOO SHORT WHEN YOU TURN IT TO COVER DRIVER WINDOW I HAVE A CONVERTIBLE SO THERE IS A BLIND SPOT
THERE IS A TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING THE VEHICLE
SLIGHT BLIND SPOT REAR PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES
REAR CAMERA WOULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL WHEN PULLING OUT OR PARKING
LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA OVERCOMING POOR MIRROR VISIBILITY FOR BACKING
REAR VISIBILITY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
THE VISIBILITY THROUGH INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW IS TERRIBLE CONVERTIBLE
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS ON THE BACK IE CAN T SEE BESIDE AND TO MY REAR WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES OR REVERSE
I CAN T SEE MY FRONT BUMPER AS IT IS A TIGHT SQUEEZE GETTING IN AND OUT OF MY GARAGE I WORRY ABOUT HITTING THE DOOR FRAME I DIDN T HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH MY BEETLE ALSO THIS CAR SEEMS TO HAVE MORE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS BUT THAT IS THE CASE WITH MOST CARS
CAR HAS BIG REAR BLIND SPOTS
LARGE BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR CONVERTABLE WINDOW WHEN YOU ARE BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE SHOULD OFFER A BACK UP CAMERA AS AN OPTION
TROUBLE BACKING NEEDS CAMERA
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS AND PASSENGER SIDE CREATED BY SMALL WINDOW IN REAR SEAT CHECKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER DOES NOT PROVIDE MUCH VISIBILITY ON EITHER SIDE
THE CONVERTIBLE ALLOWS FOR BETTER BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY THAN PREVIOUS YEARS MODELS I HAVE OWNED ESPECIALLY WITH THE TOP DOWN BUT WITH THE TOP UP I STILL AM VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT CHANGING LANES BECAUSE THERE IS STILL A BLIND SPOT EVEN WITH T
THERE ARE TWO LARGE BLIND SPOTS BECAUSE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE RETRACTING ROOF MECHANISM NO PROBLEM WHEN ROOF IS DOWN
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE WHEN TOP IS UP VERY HARD TO CHANGE LANES AND SEE OUT OF THE RIGHT SIDE
BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY BAD MUST COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY CONCERNS MEA GREAT DEAL I FEEL NERVOUS WHEN I TAKE LONG ROAD TRIPS THAT I WILL SLIP UP AND NOT BE VIGILANT IN REALLY CHECKING MY BLIND SPOTS MY DAUGHTER
REAR BLIND SPOT WHEN TOP IS UP
AWESOME VISIBILITY WITH TOP DOWN
THERE SEEMS TO BE BLIND SPOT WHEN SHIFT TO A LANE ON THE RIGHT
THE FRAMING BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK DOORS BLOCKS VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT
YOU CAN USE MORE TECHNOLOGY
THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS COULD HAVE A SMALL MIRROR ATTACHED THAT VIEWS THE BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOT FOR CHANGING LANES IS BAD ALSO BACKING UP AT NIGHT IN THE RAIN PROVES TO BE A CHALLENGE SINCE I DON T HAVE THE BACK UP CAMERA ON MY MODEL
LOVE HAVING A BACK UP CAMERA
I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THIS CAR BUT I WISH THERE WAS BETTER BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY SOMEHOW
AM IN LOVE WITH THE LED LIGHTING MAKES AN AMAZING DIFFERENCE WHEN DRIVING ESPECIALLY ON CURVY ROADS
OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE LARGER TO PROVIDE A WIDER VIEW OF CONDITIONS ON EACH SIDE
THE REAR WINDOW IS HALF THE SIZE OF PREVIOUS MODELS WHICH REDUCES THE VISIBILITY TREMENDOUSLY
THE REAR HEAD RESTS DO LIMIT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR VISIBILITY BUT IT S A MINOR THING
MINE IS A CONVERTIBLE THE VISIBILITY WHEN TOP IS UP IS LIMITED ESPECIALLY WHEN BACKING UP
I REMOVED THE REAR HEADRESTS TO INCREASE VISIBILITY I KNEW THE CONVERTIBLE WAS CRITICIZED FOR POOR REAR & SIDE VISIBILITY IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE THE REAR CAMERA ON LIKE IN AN RV WE CAN ALWAYS SEE BEHIND A WIDE RANGE WI
REAR VISIBILITY IN MY OPINION NEEDS IMPROVEMENT FROM DRIVERS SEAT
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE LANE CHANGE ALERT BUT IT WASN T AVAILABLE THIS YEAR
I HAVEN T DRIVEN THE CAR EXCLUSIVELY MY WIFE DOES I CANNOT SAY I HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH VISIBILITY ALTHOUGH THE REAR VIEW IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE CAR AND MY HEIGHT I FELT COMFORTABLE WITH SPACE AWARENESS
BLIND SPOT IS HARD TO SEE WHEN LOOKING OVER R AND L SHOULDER
WHEN THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS ARE IN THE UP POSITION 50% OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR VISIBILITY IS BLOCKED
BLIND SPOT FROM REAR PILLARS
WHEN THE CAR APPLIES THE BRAKES AUTOMATICALLY IT CAUSES REAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT TAKES LONGER TO GET BACK UP TO SPEED MEANWHILE VEHICLES BEHIND YOU START BLOWING THE HORN I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHT I VE COME TO DEPEND ON IT BUT
BLIND SPOT INDICATORS SHOULD BE ON ALL MODELS NOT JUST SOME
THE A AND B PILLARS ARE NOT IN THE WAY LIKE MOST CARS THE HEIGHT OF THE JUKE ALLOWS GREAT VISIBILITY THE C PILLAR IS A BIT THICK BUT IT DOES NOT OBSTRUCT SIGHT WHEN BACKING UP OR CHANGING LANES
THE JUKE HAS BLIND SPOTS IT S JUST THE WAY IT S MADE WHEN CHANGING LANES OR MAKING TURNS THE FRONT PILLARS REALLY GET IN THE WAY BUT AGAIN I KNEW THAT GOING IN THIS IS MY SECOND JUKE I LOVE THIS CAR
HAVING A CLEAR VIEW THROUGH THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR CAN BE ROUGH WHEN A PASSENGER IS SITTINGN THERE AND YOU ARE AT AN ANGLE ALSO VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE REAR VIEW WINDOW WHEN CAR IS FULL WITH PASSENGERS
NEEDS WIDE ANGLE MIRRORS AS PART OF THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
THERE ARE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS FOR SHORT PEOPLE
RIGHT SIDE MIRROR NEEDS MORE CONVEX SURFACE TO INCREASE FIELD OF VIEW 2ND LANE TO RIGHT IS BIG BLIND SPOT
POOR BLIND SPOT
BACK WINDSHIELD WIPER GROWLS HAVE TAKEN IT IN AND THEY STATE THAT IS NORMAL
MASSIVE BLIND SPOTS
AVERAGE BLIND SPOTS
IMPROVE REAR VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT IS KIND OF DIFFICULT TO CHECK LOWER VISIBILITY
FOG LIGHTS NEED AN UPGRADE BIGGER AND MORE VISIBILITY
I LOVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AND HOW IT TELLS ME IF ANYTHING IS APPROACHING
THE BACK UP CAMERA GETS DIRTY REALLY EASILY BUT SEEING OUT THE BACK WINDOW GOOD SO THE CAMERA ISN T A MUST TO LOOK AT
I REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING AS WELL AS THE ALERT SYSTEM WHEN BACKING UP FOR CROSS TRAFFIC
BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN MANY CONTEMPORARY CARS
THERE IS THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN GREAT VISIBILITY AND STYLING AND I AM HAPPY WITH THE BALANCE ACHIEVED
I FIND THE A PILLAR OBSTRUCTS VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY TURNING LEFT AND ABILITY TO SEE A PEDESTRIAN IN THE CROSSWALK
THE INTERIOR DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE IS GREAT AND DRIVER FRIENDLY WHEN IT COMES TO VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY THE CONTROLS ARE EASY TO REACH GREAT JOB
VISIBILITY IS ABOVE AVERAGE BLIND SPOT AWARENESS COULD BE IMPROVED
THIS WAS ANOTHER POINT WHERE THE CX 5 BEAT OUT THE COMPETITION I AM 6 1 AND MY WIFE IS 5 3 WE BOTH HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY OUT OF IT COMPARED TO THE MANY OTHERS WE TEST DROVE
BLIND SPOT TO THE RIGHT BETWEEN WINDSHIELD AND FRONT PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR
BLIND SPOTS HARD TO SEE WITHOUT THE WARNING SYSTEM IT WOULD NOT BE GOOD
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY
I HATE THE REAR VISIBILITY
THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC WARNING SYSTEM IS VERY GOOD
VISIBILITY IS NOT A STRONG POINT IN THIS CAR THE WINDOWS ARE SMALL ESPECIALLY THE REAR WINDOW THIS IS VERY OBVIOUS AFTER DRIVING A SUBARU OUTBACK FOR 10 YEARS IF IT WASN T FOR THE SIDE MIRROR ALARM SYSTEM I WOULD BE QUITE SCARED TO CHANGE
HEADLIGHT COULD POINT UP A LITTLE MORE SOMETIMES THEY SEEM LIKE THEY ARE POINTING RIGHT DOWN AT THE ROAD AND DON T GIVE ENOUGH LIGHT UP AHEAD
THE SIDE BLIND SPOTS ARE REALLY BAD
BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY ON THE DRIVER S FRONT LEFT ARE A BIT ANNOYING
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT ALERT
ADD DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY OVER HOOD WHILE DRIVING
I LIKE HAVING THE NUMBER OF AIR BAGS THAT THE CAR HAS
I WOULD LIKE A SLIGHTLY PANORAMIC REARVIEW MIRROR
WISH THERE WERE DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS ON VEHICLE
THE BACK WINDOW IS ON THE SMALLER SIDE AND DURING INCLEMENT WEATHER RAIN AND SNOW TEND TO ACCUMULATE ON IT WHICH REDUCES VISIBILITY SNOW ALSO TENDS TO PILE UP ON THE DRIVER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD WHEN USING THE WIPERS ALSO REDUCING VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY IS FINE THROUGH THE MIRRORS BUT SINCE THE BACK SEAT WINDOW FRAMES ARE LARGE THE VISIBILITY IS A LITTLE LIMITED BY TURNING THE HEAD
VISIBILITY IS GREAT NO PROBLEMS
THANK GOODNESS FOR THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING INDICATORS THERE IS A HUGE BLINDSPOT FOR ME BETWEEN THE FRONT SEAT AND BACK SEAT AND IF IT WASN T FOR THAT I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE CARS NEXT TO ME
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE PLACED TOO FAR TOWARDS THE REAR OF THE CAR THEY WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF THEY WERE CLOSER TO THE FRONT DOOR HINGES AS AN AVERAGE HEIGHT FEMALE 5 4 WITH A MANUAL TRANSMISSION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CLUTCH I HAVE TO
THE NON WINDOW SPACE IN THE BLIND SPOT AREAS IS LARGE AND OBSTRUCTS THE VIEW ESPECIALLY WHEN SHIFTING LANES
BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS A HUGE PLUS
I REALLY LIKE HAVING THE BSM AND WARNING SIGNAL WHEN YOU ARE TURNING OR CHANGING LANES AS WELL AS WHEN YOU ARE BACKING OUT OF A SPOT I FEEL A LOT BETTER KNOWING THAT I HAVE ROOM TO MOVE TO ANOTHER LANE
IT IS A HATCHBACK THEY ARE JUST HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR HENCE THE BACKUP CAMERA AND ANTI COLLISION SYSTEMS
VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW IS HORRIBLE AND IN THE FRONT IT S HARD TO TELL WHERE THE ACTUAL FRONT EDGE OF THE CAR IS AND ALSO THE FRONT RIGHT SIDE EDGE OF THE CAR THIS MAKES PARKING A BIT DIFFICULT
I LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE VEHICLES VISIBILITY I WISH THERE WAS A DIMMING REAR VIEW MIRROR I ABSOLUTLY DISLIKE THE FACT THAT THIS CAR IS EXTREAMLY LIGHT AND WITH THE LIGHTEST WINDS THE VEHICLE IS THROWN ALL OVER THE ROAD IF I KNEW THE VEHICHLE
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE ADAPTIVE HEADLIGHTS THAT STEER AROUND CORNERS WE LIVE IN WESTERN VIRGINIA WHERE THE ROADS ARE VERY TWISTY AND THESE LIGHTS MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN NIGHTTIME VISIBILITY I LOVE THE RAIN SENSING WIPERS SET THEM ON AUTO AN
BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND REAR CAMERA ARE GREAT
OVERALL I LIKE THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE CAR BUT THE A PILLARS FRONT ONES ARE ACTUALLY QUITE OBTRUSIVE WHEN GOING AROUND MOST ANY TYPE OF CURVE
I HAVE THE CAR ONLY TWO MONTHS BUT I HAVE NO PROBLEMS WITH VISIBILITY
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS FAIRLY POOR IT IS HARD TO GET A SENSE OF WHERE THE REAR CORNERS OF THE VEHICLE ARE ALSO THERE IS QUITE A LARGE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES AND A SLIGHTLY SMALLER ONE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHA
NO ISSUES WITH THE VISIBILITY AND SAFETY
BLIND SPOT ON LEFT REAR SIDE WITH SOFT TOP
WOULD LIKE A REAR VIEW CAMERA AND GPS
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A GREAT ASSET FOR DRIVING SAFETY
VISIBILITY OF LEFT REAR IS AWFUL WHEN ROOF IS CLOSED AND RIGHT REAR IS OKAY COULD BE BETTER WHEN ROOF IS STOWED AWAY THEN VISIBILITY IS GREAT
THERE IS POOR VISIBILITY TO THE SIDES OF THE CAR WHEN THE TOP IS CLOSED
REAR VISIBILITY NOT GREAT AS I FIND WITH MOST NEW CARS BUT REVERSE CAMERA VERY EFFECTIVE WHEN IN THAT GEAR
ANTI COLLISION SYSTEM IS QUITE SENSITIVE THE CAR BEEPS WHEN UNNECESSARY FRONT WIPERS ARE LACKING IN A TOTAL WINDOW WIPE A BIG SPOT IN THE DRIVERS FIELD OF VISION ISN T ENTIRELY CLEARED FURTHERMORE WHEN WASHING THE CAR WHEN I LIFT THE WIP
NEEDS TO HAVE BLIND SPOT AS A STANDARD OPTION MY CAR CAME WITH OUT IT AND FOR BEING A MERCEDES AN NOT HAVING IT MAKES IT REALLY BAD WHEN MY WIFES MAZDA CX 5 HAS IT SAD ON THAT PART
NEED DUAL VISORS ONE THAT GOES UP AND ONE THAT GOES DOWN ON THE CONVERTIBLES ALSO WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE SAFETY ALERTS ON THIS CAR I E PASSING BACKUP SO FORTH
WITH THE TOP DOWN IT S 360 DEGREES TOP UP IT S AVERAGE VISIBILITY
HEADLIGHT INDICATOR SHOULD BUZZ WHEN LEFT ON AFTER VEHICLE HAS BEEN TURNED OFF
THERE IS A NOTABLE BLIND SPOT WITH THE FOLDING HARD TOP TAKES GETTING USED TO
THE BACKUP CAMERA AND AT LEAST MINI MIRRORS SHOULD COME STANDARD AT ANY TRIM LEVEL
I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE DRIVING MY VEHICLE THIS CAR HAS THE PERFECT COMBINATION OF POWER RESPONSIVENESS BRAKING CAPABILITY AND SAFETY FEATURES THAT IN MY OPINION MAKE IT THE BEST CAR I VE DRIVEN AT THIS PRICE POINT
WHEN THE CONVERTIBLE TOP IS DOWN VISIBILITY IS EXCEPTIONAL BUT WHEN THE TOP IS UP THE BLIND SPOTS ARE THERE AND VISIBILITY IS POOR AS WITH ANY CONVERTIBLE
POOR VISIBILITY OVER LEFT SHOULDER CENTER BODY FRAME BLOCKS VIEW PARTIALLY
I FIND THE COLLISION ALERT SYSTEM IS ARBITRARY AND NOT HELPFUL IN FACT I THINK IT STARTLES ME AND THAT IS NOT SAFE I HAVE YET TO ACTUALLY FIND IT USEFUL
THE VEHICLE WARNING SYSTEM IS A PLUS FOR ME IT HELPS ME TO REALLY FOCUS WHEN CHANGING LANES THE BACKUP CAMERA IS A GREAT SAFETY FEATURE
THE DISTRONIC PLUS ACTIVE CRUISE CONTROL IS THE REASON I BOUGHT THE CAR IT AUTOMATICALLY CONTROLS THE DISTANCE TO THE CAR IN FRONT AND DOES SO VERY PRECISELY IT GREATLY INCREASES SAFETY IT GREATLY REDUCES DRIVER FATIGUE IN TRAFFIC AND ON LONG T
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT WHERE THE SEPARATION IS BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW MY HUSBAND HAS ALSO COMMENTED ON THIS WHEN HE DRIVES MY CAR
IN ADDITION TO GOOD VISIBILITY THE BLIND ASSIST SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT AND VERY USEFUL
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AND I REALLY LIKE THE AUTOMATIC HIGH BEAMS
THE MERCEDES BENZ DRIVING SAFETY IS OUTSTANDING WAY TO GO MERCEDES
REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS FULL FRONT VIEW
THE NEW SAFETY OPTIONS IN THIS VEHICLE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE A MUST IN ALL CARS ON THE ROAD
FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS DON T ALWAYS WIPE ON AUTO QUICKLY ENOUGH
SIDE MIRRORS ARE ENTIRELY TOO SMALL THE REAR CAMERA HELPS BUT I AM NOT USE TO IT YET
BLIND SPOT INDICATOR SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT
REAR VIEW MIRRORS NEED TO BE BIGGER OR MAGNIFIED
THERE IS A NEED FOR A BACK UP CAMERA
REAR VISIBILITY CAN BE HAMPERED BY REAR HEADRESTS CHANGING LANES CAN BE A CHALLENGE LOVE THE BLIND SPOT ASSIST FEATURE
BLIND SPOT IS SIGNIFICANT I DO HOWEVER TRUST THE MIRROR ALERTS
STILL FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE TO CHANGE TO RIGHT LANE CAR HAS WIDE BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY BLOCKED BY 2ND ROW HEADREST
IF I SHUT OFF ANY SAFETY FEATURE I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO STAY SHUT OFF UNTIL I TURN IT BACK ON
WONDERFUL BLIND SPOT SYSTEM NOW I CANNOT DRIVE WITHOUT IT
THE VEHICLE PROVIDES A FEELING OF SAFETY WHEN DRIVING
I M LESS HAPPY WITH SIDE VISIBILITY AT STOPLIGHTS AND SUCH THIS IS DUE TO THE CAR S LOW PROFILE AND MY HEIGHT
WOULD LIKE DOUBLE VISORS WITH EXTENSION SO NO SUN GETS IN SIDE WINDOW ALSO THE WIPER BLADES NEED TO BE REVERSED WITH BIG ONE ON LEFT SHORT ONE LEAVES A BAD SPOT IF YOU LIVE ON GRAVEL ROADS RIGHT WHERE YOU LOOK OUT OF A DIRT SPOT IN YOUR VISABILITY
SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL SOMEWHAT OFFSET BY BLIND SPOT MONITORING
THE YELLOW WARNING LIGHT ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS IS AMAZING FOR THE BLIND SPOT
I FEEL THAT THE BRAKING MECHANISM IN THE CRUISE CONTROL MODE COULD BEGIN BREAKING A LITTLE SOONER OR AT LEAST LESS ACCELERATION AS IN NORMAL DRIVING RATHER THAN AN ABRUPT BREAKING GETTING UP CLOSE TO THE SLOWING OR STOPPING VEHICLE
LANE CHANGE FEATURE IS VERY GOOD
I LIKE THE QUALITY OF THE REARVIEW CAMERA EVEN WORKS WELL IN FULL DAYLIGHT AND NIGHT BETTER THAN OTHERS I HAVE HAD AND SEEN
BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS A MUST WITH THIS CAR
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE HUGE BUT THE LIGHTS IN THE SIDE MIRRORS HELPS TREMENDOUSLY
WIPER BLADES SEEM VERY CHEAP FOR THIS LEVEL OF VEHICLE
REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM GREAT FEATURE
WHILE THE LIGHTS ON MY LEXUS ARE UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL I WISH THE CLARITY WAS GREATER FOR MY HIGH BEAMS THERE IS NOT A DRASTIC CHANGE FROM THE REGULAR HEADLIGHT SETTING TO HIGH BEAMS
IT COULD USE STRONGER WARNING THAN JUST THE MIRROR LIGHTS WHEN YOU START TO CHANGE LANES WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE IN THE BLIND SPOT MAYBE IF YOU START TO GET CLOSER TO SOMEONE IN THE BLIND SPOT YOU GET AN AUDIBLE WARNING BEFORE THE SOUND OF THE CRASH
 CAR NEXT TO YOU LIGHT ON SIDE MIRROR HELPS WITH SIDE BLIND SPOTS
I LOVE THE SECOND MIRROR IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT SHOWS YOU CARS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT
REAR CAMERA WITH GUIDELINES IS VERY NICE
THESE CARS NEED SIDE VIEW CAMERAS THE WARNING LIGHT IS NICE BUT DIFFICULT TO GAUGE
AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE GREAT EVERY CAR SHOULD HAVE THEM
ADVERTISED IN ADVERTISEMENTS VIDEOS AND MANUAL THAT REAR BACK UP CAMERA HAS ADAPTIVE LINES WHILE BACKING UP NOT PRESENT
I AM A VERY SHORT PERSON AND THE BLIND SPOT FACTOR IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH
EASY TO NAVIGATE
BAD REAR WINDSHIELD VISIBILITY SMALL WINDOWS
THE VEHICLE IS WELL DESIGNED ALLOWING FOR INCREASED VISIBILITY FRONT SIDE AND REAR THE ADDED SAFETY FEATURES CLOSE THE GAP ON ANY BLIND SPOTS
I FEEL LIKE THE MERCEDES IS BUILT MUCH MORE TOUGHER THAN MY PREVIOUS 200 LOTS OF LEG ROOM AND VISIBILITY AND LESS BLIND SPOTS ARE A PLUS
FEAR VIEW WHEN BACKING MUST BE DONE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CARE THE REARVIEW CAMERA IS GREAT BUT I MUST BEND MY NECK IN ALL DIRECTIONS WHEN BACKING PERHAPS MULTIPLE REAR VIEW CAMERAS WOULD HELP
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING FOR APPROACHING CARS ON PASSENGER SIDE
VERY GOOD BLIND SPOT MONITOR AND ACTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
EXCEPTIONAL FRONT VISIBILITY LANE DEPARTURE S FIELD OF VISION IS TOO NARROW
THERE IS A BIT OF A BIG BLIND SPOT
IT IS A CONVERTIBLE AND VISIBILITY OUT OF THE BACK MAKES IT A LITTLE HARDER
THERE SEEMS TO BE A GOOD SIZE BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDES I VE BEEN SURPRISED SEVERAL TIMES TO DISCOVER A CAR COMING UP BESIDE ME WHEN I M PREPARING TO CHANGE LANES
TERRIBLE BLIND SPOTS
DOOR POST IS IN THE WAY WHEN TRYING TO SEE IF A VEHICLE OR PEDESTRIANS ARE COMING WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE OR DRIVEWAY
EVEN WITH BLIND SPOT ASSIST I FEEL UNSURE OF THE AREAS TO THE SIDES AND REAR OF THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF SEEING CLEARLY
REAR VISIBILITY COULD BE A BIT BETTER BUT THE REAR CAMERA REALLY HELPS
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS BUT THE LANE CHANGE FEATURE MAKES IT ACCECATABLE
IT DOES HAVE BLIND SPOTS AND I AM THANKFUL FOR MY BLIND SPOT ASSIST ON THE VEHICLE IT ALONG WITH THE REAR VIEW CAMERA SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE VEHICLE S PRICE IN OTHER WORDS SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE
IT S HARD TO SEE WITH THE REAR VIEW WINDOW AT NIGHT AND MY VISION IS CUT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF CAR PASSENGER SEAT AREA IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF
THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOTS
IMPROVEMENT ON BLIND SPOT
WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT SOMEWHAT OF A BLINDSPOT OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER
I WOULD PREFER A DIFFERENT SIGNAL FROM THE BLIND SPOT WARNING MY BMW 5 SERIES USED A VIBRATION IN THE STEERING WHEEL TO WARN OF A VEHICLE IN MY BLIND SPOT I FIND THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE THE AUDIBLE SIGNAL IN THE MERCEDES CAN OBSCURED BY AMB
A BACKUP CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY LARGE VEHICLES OUT THERE IT S HARD TO SEE PAST THEM A BACKUP CAMERA WOULD DEFINITELY HELP
REAR VIEW MIRROR IS SMALL
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE AMAZING
VERY SMALL BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY IS GREAT BUT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS SMALLER
REAR VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT FOR PARALLEL PARKING DUE TO HEAD RESTS
I DO WORRY ABOUT BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES BUT IT IS STILL PRETTY GOOD AND IT COULD JUST BE THAT MY LAST CAR HAD REALLY GREAT VISIBILITY
A BLIND SPOT ON BOTH SIDES OF CAR
BEING A CONVERTIBLE THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT BOTH DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS SIDES ALSO THE SUN VISORS REALLY DON T WORK WELL WHEN THE TOP IS DOWN
REAR BLIND SPOTS APPEAR TO BE BIGGER THAN THE MODEL 2 SEATER
I THINK THE SPEEDOMETER AND TACHOMETER SHOULD BE REVERSED DIFFICULT TO SEE THE LOWER NUMBERS OF THE SPEEDOMETER THEY ARE ALWAYS IN THE SHADOW OF THE DOOR OR WINDOW FRAME
A LOT OF VEHICLES TODAY HAVE POOR REAR VISIBILITY AND LARGE BLIND SPOTS MINI IS VERY GOOD IN THIS RESPECT ONE OF THE REASONS I BOUGHT THE CAR
REAR WINDSHIELD WIPERS COULD COVER MORE OF THE REAR WINDOW
THE SMALL GREENHOUSE AND LARGE PILLARS MAKES OUTWARD VISIBILITY LESS THAN IDEAL
BLIND SPOTS IN THE CONVERTIBLES
IT IS INSANE THAT A $40K CAR DOESN T HAVE A BACKUP CAMERA ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE IS ALREADY A MONITOR FOR THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ALSO VERY DISAPPOINTING THAT SAFETY FEATURES LIKE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS NOT AVAILABLE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE PURPOS
I DON T LIKE THAT THE HAND FREE AND THE BLUETOOTH WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE CAR ALREADY WHEN PURCHASE I HAVE TO PAY SEPARATELY TO GET IT INSTALLED AND TOUCH SCREEN
BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES OF VEHICLE WHEN CHANGING LANES DUE TO CUT OF THE CONVERTIBLE TOP
THE VISIBILITY IS GOOD HAD AN EVENT WHERE I FORGOT TO TURN ON MY LIGHTS AT NIGHT AND COULD STILL SEE THE HIGHWAY WITH NO PROBLEM
I FEEL THERE ARE SOME GOOD BLIND SPOTS IN THIS VEHICLE
CONVERTIBLE TOP LIMITS REAR VISABILITY BOTH WHEN UP AND WHEN RETRACTED
THE A PILLARS CREATE A LARGE BLIND SPOT AS WELL AS THE SIDE MIRRORS
HEADLIGHTS BRIGHTS GOOD DIM TOO DIM EITHER BLINDING OTHERS OR DRIVING IN DARKNESS REAR VISIBILITY HEADREST IN MIDDLE HINDERS VISIBILITY SOME
WINDSHIELD WIPERS SUCK
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY WITH THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR
THE GIANT WING ON THE GSR DECREASES VISIBILITY SLIGHTLY
HID WOULD BE GREAT FOR VISIBILITY
NEEDS BLIND SPOT MONITORING
AS AN OLDER DRIVER I APPRECIATE THE VEHICLE SAFETY FEATURES I E LANE DEPARTURE COLLISION AVOIDANCE AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE
THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY WHEN I AM CHANGING LANES AND WHEN I AM PARKING OR LEAVING A PARKING SPOT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO TELL IF THERE IS SOMEONE THERE IF OTHERS IN THE CAR I USUALLY ASK THEM TO HELP ME
I HAVE BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING TO CHANGE LANES WHEN I TURN BACK TO LOOK IT IS HARD TO SEE WHAT IS IN THE NEXT LANE
HARD TO SEE IN THE BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE BECAUSE OF PASSENGER SEAT HEADREST AND SIDEPANEL
THE HID HEADLIGHTS PROVIDE EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AT NIGHT
HAVE NOTED THAT IT HAS A BAD BLIND SPOT
WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT THAT TOTALED OUT MY VEHICLE SO DID A LOT OF HOMEWORK ON SAFETY BEFORE BUYING
I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THE BLIND SPOTS WHEN IN HEAVY TRAFFIC SOMETIMES A VEHICLE IS RIGHT BESIDE US AND WE DON T ALWAYS SEE IT
I WISH THERE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS IN THE SIDE MIRRORS
PRETTY GOOD SIZED BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES OF VEHICLE COULD PROBABLY DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT WITH THE MIRRORS TO FIX THIS ISSUE I ADDED SMALL CONVEX MIRRORS TO ELIMINATE THE PROBLEM
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES IN MY BLIND SPOTS AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOW WHEN THE HEADRESTS TO THE THIRD ROW SEATS ARE INSTALLED
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THE ONLY BLIND SPOT IS MY REAR WINDOW BECAUSE IT S SO SMALL BUT I MAKE IT WORK
WOULD LIKE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR HIGHER TO GIVE MORE VISIBILITY FOR A TALL DRIVER WITH SEAT LOWERED AS LOW AS IT CAN GO
SIDE MIRRORS ARE LARGER THAN AVERAGE BUT THERE IS STILL A BLIND SPOT PROBLEM THAT REQUIRES FREQUENT ADJUSTMENT OF MIRROR ANGLES
SO MANY BLIND SPOTS IT S A SPORTS CAR BUT IT DESPERATELY NEEDS BLIND SPOT MONITORING FOR DAILY USE BECAUSE THE VISIBILITY IS SO POOR
IT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I HAVE TO ADJUST IT QUITE OFTEN THE SUN VISORS ARE A BIT TOO SMALL
GREAT VISIBILITY A PLEASURE TO MANEUVER
I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE BLIND SPOT FEATURE USING THE SIDE MIRRORS FOR LANE CHANGING SAFETY
THE CAMERA SYSTEM IS EXCEPTIONAL
BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS EXCELLENT
I HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE DOORS TO THE FRAME IN MERCEDES BENZ VS JAPANESE KOREAN AND AMERICAN SUVS THERE ARE MULTIPLE DISTINCT BUILD QUALITY DIFFERENCES WHICH ADD TO THE SOLID STRUCTURAL DESIGN TO MAINTAIN THE HIGHEST SAFETY
THE HOOD INTERFERES WITH FRONT VISIBILITY UP CLOSE TO THE FRONT OF THE CAR
SOMETIMES THE ALARM WARNING SOUNDS WHEN I AM TURNING LEFT AND IT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME NOT SURE WHY IT DOES THIS AND DEALER DIDN T KNOW EITHER IN GENERAL GOOD VISIBILITY EXCEPT FOR THE FRONT PILLARS CAN HIDE OTHER VEHICLES
FRONT VISIBILITY IS GOOD BUT BACK IS NOT SO GOOD AND YOU DON T GET THAT WIDE ANGLE IN THE FRONT
POOR REAR VISIBLITY REAR VIEW CAMERA SHOULD BE INCLUDED STANDARD
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE SO HIGH UP IT S HARD TO SEE IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY WERE A LITTLE LOWER THE WARNING LIGHTS DO HELP ALOT WHEN SWITCHING LANES
THE SUN VISOR IN THE REAR IS GREAT FOR BLOCKING THE SUN BUT CAN SOMETIME INCREASE BLIND SPOTS
HIGH BEAMS RATHER POOR RIGHT WIPER BLADE STREAKS EVEN AFTER CHANGING BLADES
BACKUP CAMERA IS BIG PLUS
FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS NEED TO NOT LEAVE WATER LINE WHERE THEY OVERLAP THE RIDGE OF WATER IS IN DRIVER S CENTRAL VIEWING AREA MAYBE MAKE THE DRIVER S SIDE WIPER REACH OUT FURTHER TO RIGHT AND SHORTEN RIGHT ONE TO AVOID THIS VERY ANNOYING DI
THE STOP AND START TECHNOLOGY IS NOT SOMETHING I LIKE THE CAR JERKS WHEN IT STARTS UP AGAIN
FEEL THAT THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHEN USING SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
REAR VIEW CAMERA IS NOT A CRISP PICTURE AND HARD TO GAUGE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN CARS
THE THICKNESS OF THE FRAMED AREA JUST BEHIND THE DRIVER S DOOR MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE INTO YOUR BLIND SPOT
RIGHT VISIBILITY POOR
I COULD NOT SEE A VEHICLE THAT WAS IN THE LANE NEXT TO ME WHEN DRIVING NEITHER IN MY SIDE VIEW MIRROR OR THE REAR VIEW MIRROR HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT I SAW HIM COME FROM BEHIND HAS BLIND SPOTS THAT ARE DANGEROUS
POOR VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REAR WHEN BACKING UP I DON T HAVE THE BACK UP CAMERA OPTION SO LOOKING BACK IS HARDER TO SEE LOWER OBJECTS
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING DOWN THE DRIVERS SIDE IN THE SIDE MIRROR
THERE IS NOT AS MUCH VISIBILITY THROUGH SIDE WINDOWS AS IN MY PREVIOUS JEEP
SOMETIMES I HAVE A PROBLEM SEEING CARS AT STOP SIGNS BECAUSE THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE IN THE WAY
AT TIMES IT S HARD TO SEE IN THE BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE EVEN WHEN TURNING AROUND TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS THERE THERE S ALSO A VERY PRESENT BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT I MAY HAVE TO PURCHASE THE SMALLER MIRRORS TO GO ON THE SIDE MIRRORS
VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT WHEN LOOKING BACK TO THE RIGHT REAR BLIND SPOTS
REAR WINDOW SEEMS TOO SMALL & COULD GO A LITTLE LOWER I AM 4 2 HARD TO SEE OUT SUGGEST YOU INSTALL BACK UP CAMERA EQUIPMENT AS STANDARD
REAR VISIBILITY USING THE INTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR IS VERY LIMITED
I AM HAPPY ABOUT MY VEHICLE S VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS GREAT
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WITHOUT THE BACKUP CAMERA I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THE VEHICLE
ALL VEHICALS SHOULD HAVE A BACK UP CAMERA
REAR HEADRESTS NARROW REAR VISIBILITY
BOTH SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL THEY COULD BE A LITTLE BIT WIDER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
WINDSHIELD POST ON DRIVER S LEFT SIDE BLOCKS FORWARD VISIBILITY FOR LEFT TURNS
SEEMS TO HAVE A LARGER BLIND SPOT
REALLY LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA
I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHERE THE WINDSHIELD ATTACHES TO THE CAR FRAME ON THE DRIVER S SIDE
WHEN INITIALLY PURCHASED THE DRIVER SEAT WAS SET VERY CLOSE TO FLOOR I FINALLY DISCOVERED THAT THE SEAT CAN BE RAISED ONCE I DID THAT THE VISIBILITY WAS EXCELLENT
REAR VIEW CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD FOR THIS VEHICLE
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE MORE VARIABLE SPEED ON REAR WIPER I LIKE ALL THE AUTO FEATURES FOR SEAT MEMORY AND HEADLIGHTS AS WELL AS REMOTE STARTING SYSTEM
I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE UPGRADED REAR CAMERA DISPLAY THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION WITH LANE CHANGE ASSIST AND THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT THESE FEATURES MAKE DRIVING SAFER AND THEY WORK PERFECTLY ON THIS VEHICLE
YOU SIT LOW SO LOOKING AT BLIND SPOTS IS A HASSLE TO GET USED TO
REAR VISIBILITY IN REAR VIEW MIRROR IS OBSTRUCTED BY 3RD ROW SEATS
I LOVE THE BUILT IN BACK UP CAMERA
WITH BOTH HEAD RESTS UP 2ND ROW SEATS VISION FROM REAR VIEW MIRROR IS DECREASED WHEN TRYING TO SEE OUT BACK WINDOW IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOWER THEM OUT OF THE WAY OR REMOVE THEM WHEN THESE SEATS ARE NOT BEING USED
THE REAR BACK SEATS WITH HEAD REST BLOCK OUT 20% OF THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ME AS I JUST REMOVE THE HEAD REST WHEN NO ONE IS SITTING IN THE REAR SEATS
OVERALL WE CONSIDER THE VISIBILITY TO BE VERY AVERAGE FOR A MINIVAN WHICH IS NOT BAD AT ALL BUT NOT QUITE OUTSTANDING WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM WHICH COMPENSATES FOR THE VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES
WE REALLY LIKE THE SMALL WINDOWS ON THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE ELIMINATES ANY BLIND SPOT
I LIKE THE REAR CAMERA VIEW & GUIDE LINES FOR BACKING UP I WOULD LIKE A FRONT PROXIMITY WARNING BEEPER ALSO FOR PARKING
REALLY LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA
I JUST FEEL THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS IN THE CAR AND IT MAKES IT EXTREMELY HARD TO CHANGE LANES AND THE BACK END SEEMS UP HIGHER AND I HAVE A HARD TIME BACKING IN TO SMALL SPACES
VISIBILITY IS GREAT THE VISOR COMES DOWN LOW ENOUGH THAT EVEN THE SETTING SUN IS BLOCKED
WITH ALL THE SAFTY FEATURES THE SOLID SMOOTH RIDE AND GOOD VISABLITY I FIND IT TO BE A VERY SAFE FEELING RIDE
REAR VISIBILITY BY ITSELF IS ONLY OK THE REAR CAMERA AND WARNING SYSTEM PROVIDE AN INCREASED LEVEL OF COMFORT BUT AS THE CAR ITSELF TELLS YOU IT IS STILL IMPORTANT TO CHECK AROUND THE AREA
VISIBILITY NOT THAT GOOD WHEN BACKING UP
BEING A SHORT PERSON 5 2 SOMETIMES THE DOOR WINDOW POSTS PROVIDE A CHALLENGE WHEN TRYING TO LOOK OVER A SHOULDER TO CHECK BLIND SPOTS
THIS CAR GIVES ME A FEELING OF SAFETY BECAUSE OF THE VISIBILITY
SHOULD HAVE HID HEADLIGHTS
THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP AND WHEN NEEDING TO CHANGE LANES
DOES HAVE SOME BLIND SPOT ISSUES
BIT OF A BLIND SPOT CHANGING LANES VIA MIRRORS HOWEVER CURVED SPOT MIRRORS RECTIFY PROBLEM
BLIND SPOTS HAVE ALMOST GOTTEN ME IN TROUBLE A NUMBER OF TIMES
THERE IS A TERRIBLE BLIND SIDE TO THIS KIA SOUL YOU ARE REALLY HAVING TO STRAIN TO SEE ANY TRAFFIC ON THE PASSENGER S SIDE IF I WANT TO MOVE FROM ONE LANE TO THE OTHER THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR DOES NOT HELP THAT MUCH ANYONE WHO HA
HARD TO SEE BOTH BLIND SPOTS GREAT VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK HATCH WINDOW
LOVE THE VISIBILITY PREVIOUSLY HAD A RIO & CAN SEE SO MUCH BETTER LIKE THAT I SIT HIGHER
FEEL THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
SIDE VISIBILITY TO THE RIGHT WHILE CHANGING LANES IS NOT GOOD
I LIKE THAT LACK OF BLIND SPOTS IN THE MIRRORS BUT MY PERIPHERAL VISION TENDS TO THINK VEHICLES ARE CLOSER NEXT TO ME THAN THEY ARE
THE VEHICLE HAS BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE SPACE BETWEEN THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDSHIELD AND THE DRIVER S DOOR IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT
TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT ALSO FEEL BACKUP CAMERA NOTIFICATION SHOULD BE STANDARD THIS MODEL DOES NOT HAVE
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE FRONT SIDE PASSENGER
ON MY PREVIOUS KIA SPORTAGE I HAD TO REPLACE THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER THREE TIMES I HAD THE VEHICLE FOR A LITTE MORE THAN 3 YEARS
I HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY & LIKE THE CAMERA FOR SEEING BEHIND ME WHEN BACKING UP
THE SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD SUPPORT RAIL CAUSES A MINOR BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY IS GOOD IN EVERY AREA BUT THE BLIND SPOTS RECOMMEND YOU INTEGRATE TECHNOLOGY TO SAFELY CHANGE LANES TAKE A CX 5 FOR A TEST DRIVE WITH YOUR ENGINEERS AND LEARN SOMETHING THAT WILL MAKE YOUR VEHICLE BETTER
OUTSTANDING VISIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLE
FEEL LIKE THERE IS A LARGER THAN NORMAL BLINDSPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE
REAR SIDE VISIBILTY IS NOT GOOD HEADLIGHTS TOO DIM
I BELIEVE THERE IS MORE OF A BLIND SPOT IN THIS VEHICLE COMPARED TO MY HYUNDAI TUCSON I BELIEVE IT IS BECAUSE THE SIDE GLASSES ARE SMALLER
LOVE ALL THE BUILT IN SAFETY FEATURES THAT IT HAS
SMALLER REAR WINDOW GREATLY REDUCES REAR VISIBILITY BACK HEADRESTS FURTHER REDUCE VISIBILITY WIDER BARS TO LEFT AND RIGHT OF FRONT WINDOW REDUCE SOMEWHAT BACKUP CAMERA ONLY USEFUL IF OTHER MOVING VEHICLES NOT INVOLVED
EVEN WHEN DRIVER SEAT IS ADJUSTED TO AS HIGH AS I FEEL COMFORTABLE DRIVING THE HOOD STILL SEEMS TO OBSCURE VISION AS IT SEEMS HIGH AND THE FRONT SIDE PANELS OBSCURE SIDE VISION BUT I KNOW THEY MUST BE THAT SIZE FOR THE AIRBAGS
SIDE AND REAR WINDOWS NOT AS DEEP AS IN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE ISUZU RODEO VISIBILITY TO SIDES AND REAR COULD BE BETTER
C PILLARS CREATE A LARGE BLIND SPOT THE SIDE WARNING SYSTEM IS IMPORTANT IN THIS VEHICLE
I LIKE THE VISIBILITY OF MY NEW SOUL IT IS EVEN BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS SOUL
LED HEADLIGHT ARE THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN AN AUTOMOBILE
LARGE WINDOW AND MANY AIRBAGS MAKE ME FEEL SAFE IN THE CAR
VISIBILITY IS GREAT HAVE NOTHING NEGATIVE TO SAY
THE REVIEW MIRRORS ARE MASSIVE VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING
EXCELLENT VIEW OF THE ROAD NO BLIND SPOT ISSUE THAT I NOTICED
SMALL SPACE TO SEE WITH REAR VIEW MIRROR
I HAD A ML 550 AND BOUGHT THE SPORT WHEN OUR LEASE RAN OUT THE VISIBILITY FROM THE FRONT WINDOW IS MUCH BETTER AND MORE EASY TO SEE OUT
FOR THE PRICE OF THIS VEHICLE THERE SHOULD BE BOTH A FRONT AND SIDE SUN VISOR FOR THE DRIVER
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT
VISIBILITY IS GREAT BUT AVOIDANCE SYSTEM NEEDS WORK SEE PREVIOUS COMMENTS
I LOVE THE LARGE GENERALLY RECTANGULAR WINDOW IN THE REAR IT PROVIDES EXCELLENT VISIBILITY I TEST DRIVE AND REJECTED SEVERAL OTHER VEHICLES BMW X5 ETC THAT HAVE GONE TO THE MORE MODERN STYLE OF A HIGH WAISTLINE AND SQUASHED WINDOWS FOR AN
THE HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE MAKES FOR GREAT VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY FOR SHORT PEOPLE WHICH CERTAINLY ENHANCES THE SAFETY FACTOR
VEHICLE IS ONLY A FEW MONTHS OLD AND I HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED 2 RECALLS ONE FOR THE PASSENGER AIRBAG AND ONE FOR THE VACUUM HOSE
REAR VISIBILITY SUCKS
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT WHEN THE THIRD ROW SEATS ARE UP IS REALLY BAD THE HEAD REST CONFIGURATION ALMOST ENTIRELY BLOCKS THE DRIVER S VIEW
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS FOR SMALLER DRIVER
SIDE VISIBILITY IS NOT TO GREAT WHEN TURNING BECAUSE THE SIDE MIRRORS BLOCK YOUR VIEW
REAR VIEW COULD BE IMPROVED
THE QUALITY OF THE WIPER BLADES AND THE ACCESIBILTY IN RELAXING THEM
I WISH THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR WAS MORE VISIBLE
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS BLOCK VISIBILITY AND WHEN TURN
REAR VISIBILITY IS A CHALLENGE
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR GETS IN THE WAY OF ME BEING ABLE TO SEE THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD SINCE I AM TALL
I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT OUT REAR PASSENGER SIDE HEAD REST IS TOO LARGE TO SEE CLEARLY OUT BACK CORNER OF REAR WINDOW
THE A AND B PILLARS ARE A LITTLE BIT LARGE AND HINDER MY VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT
REAR SEAT HEADRESTS INTERFERE TOO MUCH WITH VIEW FROM REAR VIEW MIRROR
DIFFICULT GAUGING DISTANCE BETWEEN REAR OF VEHICLE AND SURROUNDINGS THIS VEHICLE DEFINITELY NEEDS A REAR CAMERA
I ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT BLIND SPOTS I WAS HIT ON DRIVER S SIDE FRONT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE THAT ALERT YOU MENTIONED A FEW TIMES
WAY TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS FROM DRIVERS SEAT
BLIND SPOT ON REAR DRIVER SIDE MAKES ME NERVOUS
BLIND SPOTS NOT SO GOOD
I ALREADY MENTIONED HOW THE HEADRESTS FOR THE REAR SEAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY FOR THE DRIVER SO GET RID OF THE DAMN THINGS ALREADY
OVERALL PRETTY DECENT NOT EXCEPTIONAL BUT NOT BAD IN ANY OF THE VISIBILITY CATEGORIES ONLY IMPROVEMENT MIGHT BE A LONGER SUN VISOR LENGTH WISE FOR WHEN THE SUN IS DEAD AHEAD OF YOU SO IT DOESN T FALL BETWEEN THE VISORS
THE REAR VIEW IS BLOCKED BY SPARE TIRE AND REAR WIPER BLADE MOTOR
IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE BLIND SPOT DRIVERS IT S A LITTLE HARD TO LOOK AROUND THE HEADRESTS DOORS AND SUCH TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT TOTALLY
WOULD HAVE LIKED ADDITIONAL FEATURES BUT WERE NOT ON VEHICLE LIKE REAR CAMERA AND PARKING ASSIST
ADDING A REAR CAMERA OR LANE CHANGE CAMERA WOULD BE NICE SINCE MANY JEEPERS ME INCLUDED PUT LARGER TIRES ON OUR JEEPS SO THE REAR VIEW GETS EVEN MORE BLOCKED AFTER THEY ARE MOUNTED TO THE REAR
VISIBILITY FROM REAR WINDOW COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER I M SHORT SO THAT COULD BE PART OF THE REASON THAT VISIBILITY IS LESS
I FEEL THAT THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT
THE ONLY THING I DO NOT LIKE IS THAT THERE ARE NO SIDE AIRBAGS IF A COLLISION WAS TO HAPPEN FROM THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THERE IS NOTHING PROTECTING YOU FROM THE IMPACT AND THE METAL DOOR
IT WOULD BE NICE IF VISOR HAD AN EXTRA FEW INCHES OR A SECTION TO PULL OUT TO BLOCK THE SUN THERE IS A BIG GAP BETWEEN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND THE VISOR EDGE THAT LETS A LOT OF SUN THEOUGH AND BLINDS ME
REAR WINDOW WIPER COMPONENT SEEMS TO BLOCK VIEW
THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOTS THE ONE THAT I CONSTANTLY HAVE TO BE CAREFUL WITH WHEN PULLING INTO TRAFFIC IS BETWEEN THE FRONT SEAT AND BACK SEAT WINDOWS
HIGH BEAM HEAD LIGHTING SEEMS SCATTERED AND NOT VERY USEFUL THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA IS OUTSTANDING IN ACCURATELY DISPLAYING DISTANCES TO MATCH VEHICLE LENGTH AND TURN RADIUS
MOTOR FOR REAR WINDOW WIPER TAKES AWAY A GOOD PORTION OF REAR VISION
HARD TO SEE CARS IN BLIND SPOTS WINDOWS COULD BE BIGGER ALONG WITH LARGER REAR VIEW WINDOW
I LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA
THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER PARTIALLY OBSTRUCTS THE VIEW TO THE REAR
IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE VEHICLES ON BOTH SIDES WHEN CHANGING LANES THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES
WIPERS TEND TO ICE EASILY AND THEN DON T WORK WELL REAR WIPER IS TOO SMALL ONLY CLEANS THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDOW THE WASHER SPRAYERS ARE GREAT THOUGH AS THEY FAN OUT INSTEAD OF STREAMS I PUT AVERAGE FOR THE VISORS BUT I AM SHORT SO NO CAR HAS G
IT APPEARS TO HAVE SOME BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOTS ARE DIFFICULT WISH I HAD THE WARNING SYSTEM FOR THE BLIND SPOT AND PARKING OR VEHICLE PROXIMITY
THE ONLY VISIBILITY ISSUE IS THE PLACEMENT OF THE HEADREST AND ITS INTERFERENCE WITH REAR VIEW VISIBILITY
BSM IS GREAT
I LOVE THE LANE CHANGE WARNINGS
I RALLY LIKE THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT WHEN BACKING UP AND THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
I HAD A MAJOR CAR ACCIDENT WITH MY GS 350 AND THE CAR SAVED MY LIFE I BOUGHT A GS 350 BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY IT PROVIDES
LANE MONITORING AND REAR VIEW CAMERA MAKE UP FOR ANY DEFICIENCIES
I HAD TROUBLE FINDING A GS WITH LANE DEPARTURE FEATURE SORRY I DIDN T PURSUE IT FURTHER
BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES PILLARS BLOCK VIEWS AND SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD PROVIDE BETTER COVERAGE
LOVE THE BUILT IN WARNING SYSTEM IN THE SIDE MIRRORS
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR HELPS TO KEEP YOU FROM CHANGING LANES INTO ANOTHER CAR GREAT FOR OLD PEOPLE LIKE ME
MAIN ISSUE IS THE POOR REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER THAT DOESN T CLEAR MORE THAN ONE FOURTH OF THE WINDOW SO VISIBILITY IS REDUCED
NEED DUAL SUN VISORS LEFT & RIGHT SIDE SO GLARE CAN BE CONTROLLED FRONT & SIDE AS YOU DRIVE
BACK UP CAMERA IS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY
I AM 5 FT 8 INCHES TALL ABOUT AVERAGE I FIND THAT THE DRIVER S SEAT HEIGHT HAS A MAJOR EFFECT ON VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES ON THE FREEWAY EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE CAME WITH LANE SENSORS WHICH IS OUTSTANDING YOU STILL NEED TO GLANCE BA
HAVING A WARNING SYSTEM WHEN CHANGING LANES IS A GREAT IDEA I APPRECIATE TO MINIMIZE BLIND SPOT PROBLEMS
THE DRIVER SEAT DOESN T GO DOWN AS FAR AS I WOULD LIKE I M 6 FOOT TALL THE BACKUP CAMERA IS HELPFUL AND USEFUL
WISH IT HAD MEMORY SEATS AND SIDE MIRROR ALERT
VERY GOOD VISIBILITY SIT HIGH IN THE VEHICLE
REAR VISIBILTY IS NOT VERY GOOD THE SIDE MIRRORS HELP BUT THEY ARE SO BIG THAT THEY IN TURN BLOCK SIDE VISIBILTY
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE NIGHT VISION AND HEADS UP DISPLAY
BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS A BEAUTIFUL THING
VERY BAD BLIND SPOT BETWEEN WINDSHIELD AND SIDE WINDOWS DUE TO FRAME
I AM 5 1 AND HAVE BLOCKED VISION SEEING IN THE DIRECTION THROUGH THE SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
I WISH THAT WINDSHIELD WIPER DEICERS WERE STANDARD EQUIPMENT
SEEMS VERY WELL DESIGNED VERY GOOD BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM
POOR VISIBILITY BUT THANKS TO THE MIRROR WARNINGS LANE DEPARTURE AND NIGHT VISION SHOULD BE STANDARD ON THIS CAR FOR THE PRICE YOU PAY
BLIND SPOTS TO BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT REAR VIEWS REQUIRE EXTRA CAUTION WHEN LANE CHANGING
I AM CONCERNED I CAN NOT SEE IN MY BLINDSPOT EXCEPT WITH USE OF BMS THE OUTSIDE SIDE MIRRORS ARE ALSO TOO LARGE AND OBSTRUCT MY VIEW WHEN I M ENTERING A ROAD
THE BSM S ARE AN EXCELLENT ADDITION
BACK WINDOW COULD USE A LITTLE MORE VISIBILITY I FEEL THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS
BACK SEAT HEADRESTS RESTRICT REAR VISION RESOLVED WITH POWER RECLINING BACK SEATS AS LONG AS THERE AREN T ANY PASSENGERS
LOVE THE BSM SYSTEM SUPERB HEADLIGHTS FOG LIGHTS HIGH BEAMS AUTO WIPERS ARE A TREAT
THE SUN VISORS SHOULD BE TALLER FORWARD CORNER VISIBILITY IS AIDED BY THE SMALL FORWARD SIDE WINDOWS WHICH IS A NICE ADDITION
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE SAFETY FEATURES LIKE A CAR APPROACHING AND WARNINGS ABOUT LANE CHANGES
THE DARK REAR WINDOWS ARE NOT GOOD FOR REAR VISIBILITY
THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING DOES A GREAT JOB OF COMPENSATING FOR THE REAR COLUMN AND THE PARKING ASSIST SYSTEM HAS WARNED ME SEVERAL TIMES OF DRIVERS SPEEDING PAST AS I BACK OUT OF A PARKING SPOT I ALSO APPRECIATE THE DIMMING OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIR
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR NEED TO RELY ON REARVIEW CAMERA
REAR CAMERA IS STANDARD AND IS NEEDED
I FEEL THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OUT THE BACK PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT
THE REAR VIE CAMERA SCREEN HAS NO GUIDE BARS FOR BACKING UP I FIND IT ESSENTIALLY USELESS AND DISAPPOINTING TO FIND ON THE RX WHEN MY OLDER CAMRY HAS VERY USEFUL GUIDE BARS TO ASSIST WHEN VIEWING THE REAR CAMERA MONITOR
THERE IS HARDLY ANY REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP THANK GOODNESS FOR PARK ASSIST
VERY EASY TO DRIVE WITH BLIND SPOT MONITORS FRONT AND REAR COLLISION AVOIDANCE AND REAR CAMERA
HUGE BLIND SPOTS HAVING BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS ESSENTIAL
REAR VISIBILITY THRU REAR WINDOW IS LIMITED BUT SIDE MIRRORS ARE SUFFICIENT TO OVERCOME THAT
HEADLIGHT BRIGHTNESS IS GREAT
REAR CAMERA BLIND SPOT MONITOR AND PARK ASSIST MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO HIT ANYTHING WHILE DRIVING
I THINK THERE WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT IF NOT FOR THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR
THE REAR LANE CHANGE VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT HOWEVER I CAN ACCEPT THIS DUE TO THE SPORT NATURE OF THE VEHICLE
WISH SEAT MEMORY ALSO APPLIED TO THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS A STROKE OF GENIUS AND MAKES DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY SO MUCH SAFER AND MORE PLEASURABLE
THIS MODEL WITHOUT BLIND SPOT ALERTS WOULD BE A DANGEROUS ASPECT
I HAVE THE BLIND SPOT FEATURE ON MY CAR WHICH IS A TREMENDOUS HELP IN CHANGING LANES I HAVE ALSO FOUND THAT THE VISIBILITY IN THIS VEHICLE IS MUCH BETTER THAN IN MY MKX THE HOOD SLOPES DOWN TOWARD THE BUMPER AND THE POSTS ARE MUCH SMALLER A
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING BEHIND TO BACK UP OUT OF A PARKING SPACE A FLAW IN THE RC DESIGN
FEEL SAFE BECAUSE I CAN EASILY LOOK IN EITHER SIDE MIRROR AND KNOW BECAUSE OF THE YELLOW DOT IN THE MIRROR IF A CAR IS IN MY BLIND SPOT
I LOVE THE BLIX BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHT AND THE RADAR SENSING SIGNAL FOR VEHICLE COMING FROM LEFT OR RIGHT REAR CAMERA IS EXCEPTIONAL TOO AND I WISH THERE WAS ONE IN THE FRONT OF THE CAR TO GO WITH THE FROM LOCATION BEEPERS
I CAN T SEE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW AT ALL THANK YOU FOR THE CAMERAS
THE VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE THE AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS I E TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY WHEN THEY SENSE WATER ON THE WINDSHIELD
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT SENSORS ALSO IMPRESSIVE EMERGENCY STOP ON FREEWAY FEEL VERY SAFE IN THIS CAR
WINDSHIELD WIPERS SHOULD HAVE AUTO SETTING
THIS CAR HAS MAJOR BLIND SPOTS BUT IT S NO ISSUE WITH THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM I VE HAD TO RELY ON THIS SYSTEM IN TRAFFIC
ADDED ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL OPTION AND LOVE IT GREAT FEET FREE DRIVING EXPERIENCE ON HIGHWAY
BLIND SPOT GREAT OPTION
BLIND SPOTS IN THE MIDDLE OF ECH SIDE
VISIBILITY WHILE BACKING UP IS NOT GOOD WHEN TURNING TO LOOK BACK OVER LEFT SHOULDER
WOULD LIKE A HEADS UP DISPLAY
WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORK WELL IN HEAVY RAINS
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE GREAT BUT THE PLASTIC ENCLOSURE DISTORTS THE VISABILITY I SEE PINK AND ORANGE CONCENTRATIONS OF LIGHT DISTORTION WHEN I DRIVE UP TO A WALL
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM VERY MUCH AS WELL AS THE REAR VIEW CAMERA WHEN BACKING UP
FEELING OF SAFETY
THERE IS LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT DUE TO THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS
THE PILLAR BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOORS IS VERY WIDE WHICH MAKES SIDE VISIBILITY DIFFICULT AT TIMES
HAVING A BUILT IN SPOT MIRROR WOULD BE NICE I HAVE THE BLIND SPOT OPTION AND IT WORKS NICELY BUT WHEN MERGING CARS APPROACH QUICKLY FROM THE SIDE IT IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE
I FEEL THAT I HAVE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT
BLIND SPOT IS WONDERFUL EVERY CAR SHOULD HAVE THIS AS STANDARD
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE OF THE SAFETY FEATURES BUILT INTO THIS AUTO AS DOES SOME OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE AUTOS
MY SIGHT LINES ON EITHER SIDE OF MY VEHICLE ARE BELOW PAR I AM GLADE THAT I HAVE BLIND SPOT ALERT INDICATOR
BLIND SPOT MONITORING MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR ANY VISIBILITY LIMITATIONS WHEN WANTING TO CHANGE LANES
I FEEL THAT THE VISIBILTY OUT THE BACK OF THE VEHICAL IS BLOCKED BY THE SIDE PILLERS MORE THAN I AM USED TO FROM MY OTHER VEHICALS
THE BLINDSPOT SENSORS ARE GREAT THE FRONT AND REAR SENSORS FOR BUMPING INTO THINGS MAY BE A LITTLE TOO SENSITIVE
CHANGING CD PLAYER TO HOLD ONLY ONE CD INSTEAD OF SIX ON THE HOME SCREEN YOU CAN EITHER SHOW THE MONTH AND DATE WHERE BEFORE YOU WOULD SEE TIME AND DATE
I M GLAD I GOT THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM BECAUSE THE CAN HAS A GOOD SIZE BLIND SPOT FOR SOMEONE 5 7 TALL THE COLUMN BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK WINDOWS IS BIG
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR
LOOKING BACK LEFT AND RIGHT HAVE BLIND SPOTS
IT SEEMS TO BE TAKING ME A LONG TIME TO ADJUST TO THE VEHICLE S BLIND SPOTS
THE LANE CHANGING ALERT IS PROBABLY SOMETHING EVERY VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE IT IS AN AMAZING SAFETY FEATURE
LIKE MOST VEHICLES THERE IS A BLIND SPOT
GOOD VISIBILITY ALL AROUND
SIGHTLINES FROM THE NAVIGATOR S DRIVER SEAT ARE EXCELLENT ALL AROUND VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT REAR VISIBILITY AND BLIND SPOTS IN THE VEHICLE WHEN I FIRST TEST DROVE IT BUT RANGE ROVER HAS DONE A REMARKABLE JOB IN ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES WITH THE VEHICLES SENSORS AND CAMERAS I HAVE NOT HAD ANY ISSUES OR CONCERNS WITH
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW BETTER FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
DIFFICULT AT TIMES WITH VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT LOOKING TO RIGHT SIDE OF VEHICLE WHEN MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN
DOES HAVE A BLIND SPOT YOU HAVE TO GET USE TO
REAR WINDOW IS A BIT SMALL THE FRONT LEFT FRONT PYLON GETS IN THE WAY OF VISIBILITY SOMETIMES AS DOES THE REARVIEW MIRROR MOUNT PARTICULARLY WHEN MAKING TUNS
THERE IS A SMALL BLIND SIDE ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WHEN CHECKING FOR CARS BEFORE CHANGING LANES OTHER THAN THAT IT IS VERY EASY TO SEE OUT
IT IS PREFERABLE TO HAVE XENON HEADLIGHTS
NEEDS BLIND SPOT MONITORS
I WOULD HAVE PAID AND REALLY WANTED COLLISION WARNING   LANE CHANGING CAMERAS AND WARNING SYSTEMS THEY ARE UNAVAILABLE ON THIS MODEL ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE ARE SO MANY BLINDSPOTS THESE FEATURES WOULD MAKE THIS AND EXCEPTIONAL CAR HAD I BEEN A
A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
CANNOT SEE OUT CENTER OF FRONT WINDSHIELD THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS BLOCKING THE VIEW
COULD USE BLIND SPOT LIGHTS IN REAR VIEW MIRRORS
MY MAIN CHALLENGE WITH THE TWO LEXUS CT HYBRIDS THAT I HAVE HAD IS THE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE IT IS DANGEROUS AND I AM SURPRISED THAT IT HAD NOT BEEN CORRECTED BETWEEN THE MODEL AND THE MODEL THIS FEATURE IS DANGEROUS AND
WONDERING WHY THE VEHICLES MAKES NOISES WHEN THE ENGINE IS TURNED OFF THE NAVIGATION SCREEN IS DIFFICULT TO SEE
GOOD VISIBILITY AND SAFETY ALL AROUND JUST WHEN CHANGING LANES THE BLINDSPOTS MAKE IT HARD TO CHANGE LANES
THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE FOR PROMOTING SAFE DRIVING AND AVOIDING ACCIDENTS THE BACK CROSS TRAFFIC WARNING SYSTEM IS ALSO A TREMENDOUS SAFETY FEATURE IN PARKING LOTS AS IS THE BACK UP CAMERA
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
SEE MY EARLIER COMMENT REGARDING VISIBILITY AND PEDESTRIANS
IF IT WEREN T FOR THE BLIND SPOT ASSIST THIS CAR WOULD VERY VERY HARD TO DRIVE IN TRAFFIC
LOOKING THRU THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I CANNOT SEE OUT BACK WINDOW WELL BECAUSE OF A MIDDLE HEAD REST IN THE WAY
GOOD THING THERE IS BLIND SPOT MONITORING BECAUSE LOOKING FOR LANE CHANGES IS A LITTLE CHALLENGING LOVE THE REAR CAMERA
THE COVERAGE OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE IS UNUSUALLY GREAT
SLIDING SUN VISOR WOULD BE GREAT TO BLOCK THE LIGHT FROM SIDE WINDOWS BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGER THAN EXPECTED HAVE TO RELY ON BLIND SPOT MONITORING BACKING BY LOOKING AT THE REAR WINDOW ISN T SAFE HAVE TO USE THE CAMERA AND SIDE MIRRORS DRIVER S
SIDE MIRROR BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHT
BECAUSE IT S A CONVERTIBLE VISIBILITY IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM ONCE THEIR ARE REAR CAMERAS AND ELECTRONIC LANE AND SIDE SENSORE THAT WILL ALLEVIATE THESE ISSUES
REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS TO TAKE UP TOO MUCH ROOM
THE VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER SEAT ON THE LEFT SIDE BACK IS DIFFICULT WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT I CAN EASILY SEE BEHIND CENTRAL AND BEHIND TO THE RIGHT BUT HAVE LIMITED VIEW BEHIND TO THE LEFT
SHOULD HAVE BETTER REAR VIEW VISABILITY
THE HEADS UP DISPLAY ON THE WINDSHIELD IS EXCEPTIONAL
LOVE THE LANE BLIND ASSIST AND BACK UP CAMERAS GREAT CAR
THE B PILLAR IS A LITTLE ON THE THICK SIDE SO IT S A GREAT THING THAT BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS AVAILABLE I THINK IT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC WITHOUT THAT FEATURE
VISIBILITY IS UNACCEPTABLE IN THE BACK SEAT
I WOULD LIKE BETTER REAR VISIBILITY BUT REALIZE THIS IS PART OF THE COMPROMISE FOR FUEL EFFICIENCE
I D LIKE TO SEE THE ADDITION OF WHITE HEADLIGHTS
BLIND SPOT ASSIST AND FORWARD WARNINGS ARE GREAT REALLY GIVE A FEELING OF SAFETY AND AVOID ACCIDENTS
DUAL SUN VISORS WOULD BE A WORTHWHILE ADDTION
VISIBILITY AT CORNERS ID NOT GOOD CORNER POSTS ON WINDSCREEN TOO LARGE OR LOCATED BADLY
WISH I HAD GOTTEN REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER FOR MORNING DEW
VISIBILITY PARALLEL PARKING TO THE REAR
DRIVER ADJUSTMENTS I E RADIO FUNCTIONS NEED PHYSICAL BUTTONS TO PERFORM BASIC FUNCTIONS SUCH AS SEEK WITHOUT HAVING TO RESORT TO MULTI LEVEL MENUS VIA VIDEO SCREEN
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
BLIND SPOT ON THE FRONT PASSENGER PILLER DO NOT KNOW IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE FOR THAT THOUGH
LOVE THE LANE CHANGE WARNING AND COLLISION WARNING FEATURES
VISIBILITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESSENED WHEN PASSENGERS ARE IN THE THIRD ROW RAISING OF THE HEAD RESTS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE VISIBILITY WITHOUT THE THIRD ROW SEAT HEAD RESTS UP IS UNAFFECTED
I VE HAD SO MANY OF THESE CARS BECAUSE OF THE FEELING OF SAFETY THEY IMPART
BLIND SPOT DETECTION IS USEFUL AND SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE ON ALL VEHICLES THE AUTOMATIC WIPER SPEED CONTROL IS NICE ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES IT DOES NOT CONTROL AT THE RIGHT SPEED
USING THE SMART CRUISE CONTROL SYSTEM WITH AUTOMATIC ACCELERATION AND DECELERATION AND DISTANCE ADJUSTMENT WITH THE CAR IN FRONT ON THE FREEWAY ALLOWS ME TO CONCENTRATE ON OTHER SAFETY ASPECTS SUCH AS PAYING ATTENTION TO CARS ON THE SIDE OR IN
I DO NOT LIKE THE WARNING LIGHTS ON THE SIDE MIRRORS YESTERDAY THERE WASN T A CAR IN SIGHT AND IT GAVE ME THREE VERY LOUD BEEPS
FRONT VISIBILITY DECENT MAIN PROBLEM IS THE FAT A PILLARS THEY ARE ENGINEERED TO HOLD THE VEHICLE S WEIGHT IF IT FLIPS OVER HOWEVER THIS MAKES THEM MASSIVE AND SURPRISINGLY HARD TO SEE AROUND REAR VISIBILITY POOR IT S A CONVERTIBLE
BLIND SPOT SEEMS LARGER THAN NORMAL
FRONT BUMPER CAMERA FOR ALL AROUND 360 DEG VISIBILITY AND SLOWLY ADVANCING TOWARDS PARKING SPACES OR INSIDE GARAGES IS A GREAT POSITIVE FEATURE LOVE IT BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEMS ALSO GREATLY VALUED BY US
HAVING HAD A LEXUS GX470 BEFORE THE GL450 IT SEEMS THAT VISIBILITY OF NEARBY AND OR REAR VEHICLES IS LESS THANK GOODNESS FOR THE BLIND SPOT DETECTORS WHICH ARE GREAT
THE WARNING SYSTEM SOMETIMES GOES OFF EVEN WHEN THERE ARE NO OBSTRUCTIONS
I DON T HAVE A PROBLEM SEEING AROUND ME FROM INSIDE TO OUTSIDE ESPECIALLY WITH BLIND SPOT ASSIST
THE BLIND SPOT AND LANE CHANGE SYSTEMS ARE EXCELLENT
LOVE THE WARNING SYSTEMS
LOVE THE VISABILITY OVERALL FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WHEN CHANGING LANES ALL AROUND VISIN IS EXCELLENT
ADDED A REAR VIEW CAMERA
ON SAFETY ISSUE WISH CAR DOORS WOULD LOCK UPON STARTING IGNITION OR PUTTING THE CAR IN GEAR WISH I COULD LOCK DOORS FROM THE INTERIOR WHEN EXITING INSTEAD OF USING THE REMOTE CLICKER
THE FRONT COLLISION SYSTEM WARNING IS VERY SENSITIVE WHEN DRIVING IN CONGESTION WITH CLOSER FOLLOW RANGE THE SYSTEM WARNS AT TIMES THAT DON T SEEM COMPLETELY NECESSARY
LOVE THE LANE CHANGING SAFETY FEATURES
THE FEATURE FOR AUTO BRIGHT LIGHTS IS NOT EASY TO USE TOO TECH SAVVY FOR ME REQUIRES ME TO GET ANOTHER LESSON OR READ THAT FEATURE CHAPTER MULTIPLE TIMES
IN BAD WEATHER THE REAR WIPERS DON T CLEAR OFF ENOUGH OF THE BACK WINDOW
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR PURCHASING IT
REAR VISIBILITY IS EQUAL TO OTHER SUVS
GREAT VISIBILITY AND THE TURNING ABILITY OF THE CAR IS AMAZING
THE LANE CHANGING WARNING IS FANTASTIC
THE HEADLIGHTS PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY DURING NIGHTTIME DRIVING
VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING BACK TO RIGHT THE HEADREST ARE TO HIGH FOR GOOD VISABILITY
LIMITED VISABILITY
THERE IS A SMALL BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING OUT OF CERTAIN SPOTS
BACK PANEL WHILE IN REVERSE IS A BLIND SPOT
WISH I HAD LANE CHANGE WARNING
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A BACK UP CAMERA IN MY NAVIGATION SCREEN
YOU REALLY CAN T TELL HOW CLOSE A CAR OR A WALL IS BEHIND YOU USING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR YOU DON T GET A GOOD PERSPECTIVE OF THE END OF THE TRUNK
REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED SUCH AS LARGER REAR VIEW MIRROR AND REAR GLASS
EXCELLENT VISIBILTY
THE PROGRAMING OF THE SAFETY SYSTEMS COULD BE BETTER OR EASIER
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE OUTSTANDING AND EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE ON COUNTRY ROADS I WAS VERY IMPRESSED THAT THEY WERE A STANDARD FEATURE AND THIS WAS ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT MADE ME PURCHASE THE MERCEDES HOWEVER I THINK THAT MZB SHOULD MAKE THE DYNAM
REGARDLESS OF OPTIONS IF THERE IS A BACKUP CAMERA A PROXIMITY SENSOR ALERT SHOULD BE INCLUDED
VISIBILITY IS GOOD HEADLIGHTS ARE AMAZINGTHE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS GREAT
BLIND SPOTS ARE TOO LARGE
OBVIOUSLY IT IS A SPORTS CAR AND I HAD REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE VISIBILITY
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS AN EXCELLENT FEATURE
GOOD BACKUP CAMERA AND CROSS TRAFFIC WARNING BUT REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY IS INADEQUATE SMALL WINDOW
REAR VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE BETTER BLIND SPOT IS BIG
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE VERY BIG MAKING ME WORRY ABOUT BLIND SPOTS
I THINK THAT ALL CARS SHOULD HAVE BUILT IN BLIND SIDE INDICATORS
DEFINITELY SOME STRANGE BLIND SPOTS
I DON T HAVE ANY CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY FEEL VERY SAFE WITH THIS VEHICLE
GREAT CAR VISIBILITY IS GREAT
COMING FROM A CHRYSLER PACIFICA THE VISIBILITY IN THIS CAR IS FANTASTIC
LANE DEPARTURE IS A LITTLE TOO SENSITIVE
LOVE THE HEADLIGHT SCOPE CAN SEE THE SIDES OF THE ROAD WELL WHICH IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU LIVE IN AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE RIDE BICYCLES
POOR VISIBILITY OUT OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD ON THE GRAND TOURING MODEL DUE TO THE ELECTRONICS SYSTEM PLACED ON THE WINDSHIELD
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHEN BACKING ALARM SYSTEM HAS BECOME ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS ABOUT THIS CAR
GOOD VISIBILITY OUT OF PASSENGER WINDOW FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT DUE TO THE SMALL WINDOW IN FRONT OF THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR
THE HEADLIGHT SYSTEMS AND TAIL LIGHTS ON THE VEHICLE ARE VERY GOOD VERY VISIBLE IN MORNING AND EVENING CONDITIONS
I UNDERSTAND THE REAR WIPER BLADE CANNOT EXCEED THE DIMENSIONS OF THE WINDOW ITSELF BUT IT SEEMS TO SWEEP A SMALL AREA
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS DUE TO THE SIDE WINDOW DESIGN
VERY BAD BLIND SPOTS AS COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE HAD
ITS EASY TO SEE THE DEPARTURE LANE WITH THE SAFETY WARNINGS
LANE CHANGE ALERT COMES ON WHEN NO CAR IS IN MY BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT
I LIKE THE DRIVING POSITION AND VISIBILITY IN GENERAL
DIFFICULT TO SEE ALL OF FRONT HOOD AND BLIND SPOT IN FRONT WINDOW NEAR REAR VIEW WINDOWN
INCLUDE PROXIMITY WARNING WHEN IN REVERSE ESPECIALLY SINCE MY VEHICLE INCLUDES THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE
BLIND SPOTS
WOULD BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT WITH NO CAMERA
BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM WORKS WONDERFULLY
I HAVE HAD ISSUES WHEN IT S POURING OUT WITH THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WHEN IT IS RAINING HEAVILY IT FEELS LIKE THE WIPERS ARE JUST SMEARING THE RAIN AND CAUSING LESS VISIBILITY
GREAT VISIBILITY I FEEL SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR HEADLIGHTS ARE A LITTLE WEAK IMO
REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM WISHED CAR HAD BACKUP CROSS TRAFFIC DETECTION BECAUSE OF THE SLOPE LINE OF HOOD IT S HARD TO ACCURATELY JUDGE WHERE THE FRONT OF THE CAR IS BUT THIS SEEMS TRUE OF ALL RECENT MODEL CARS DIDN T
LIKE MOST HATCHBACKS THERE IS A BLIND SPOT CAUSED BY THE REAR ROOF PILLARS THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING ALWAYS CATCHES ANYTHING IN THAT AREA THOUGH
I TOOK THE REAR SEAT CENTER HEAD REST OUT TO PROVIDE MORE REAR VISIBILITY
THERE ARE SOME REALLY LARGE BLIND SPOTS THAT WITHOUT THE CAMERA WOULD MAKE THE CAR NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE COMFORTABLY STILL GETTING USED TO RELYING ON THE NEW TECHNOLOGY
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A NECESSITY FOR ME
THE SIDE VISIBILITY ISN T AS CLEAR AS MY LAST VEHICLE THERE SEEMS TO BE MORE OF A BLIND SPOT AT THE FAR SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD
BIG BLIND SPOT ON REAR SIDES WHEN TOP IS UP REALLY BIG
THE INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR PARTIALLY BLOCKS VIEW WHEN TURNING RIGHT
VISIBILITY IS AN ISSUE IN THIS CAR I CANNOT SEE VEHICLES THAT ARE IN MY SIDE VIEW EASILY AND THE REARVIEW IS VERY SMALL AS WELL WHEN THE SPOILER RAISES IT REDUCES THE REAR VIEW MORE
WHEN THE CONVERTIBLE TOP IS UP YOU HAVE HUGE BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE
WIPERS COULD BE BETTER TRUNK IS A BIT TOO HIGH SHOULD HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED STANDARD WITH A BACK UP CAMERA
PLENTY OF GLASS ALL AROUND BLIND SPOT MIRRORS WOULD BE A PLUS THOUGH
FROM THE DRIVER SEAT I M A TALL GUY AND SLIGHTLY CLAUSTROPHOBIC SO SHORT ROOFS MAKE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE LIKE ON THE DODGE DART BUT NOT THIS CAR VERY OPEN AND VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING
HAVE ONLY HAD THE CAR FOR TWO MONTHS STILL ADJUSTING TO KNOWING THE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT BECAUSE OF THE SPOILER AND THE BACK BEING A BIT HIGHER BUT THE REAR VIEW CAMERA REALLY MAKES UP FOR IT
WHEN CHANGING LANES YOU HAVE TO PHYSICALLY CHECK REAR BLIND SPOT BY TURNING AROUND AND LOOKING BACK
LOVE LOVE LOVE THE XENON   LED LIGHTS
I HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE AND THERE IS NO BACK UP CAMERA I FEEL THAT IS A GROSS OVERSIGHT BY MINI ALL THE ELECTRONICS IN THERE AND NO CAMERA SEEMS SILLY
WITH WINDOW AIR DEFLECTORS INSTALLED THERE IS MUCH LARGER BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVER S SEAT WHEN MAKING TURNS
LIKE BACK UP CAMERA
WISH REAR CAMERA HAD BEEPER SOUND WHEN BACKING TO ALERT HOW CLOSE VEHICLE IS TO AN OBJECT
THE VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD WHILE DRIVING IS GREAT
SPOILER COVERS UP REAR VIEW FROM DRIVERS POSITION IT IS TO BE EXPECTED
WELL THAT IS A TOSS UP VISIBILITY IS A PLUS BUT DRIVING ON A WINDY OR RAINY DAY CAR SEEM LIKE IT LACKS STABILITY TRACTION WISE
ENTERING HIGHWAY FROM A DRIVER S SIDE ENTRANCE IS NOT A PROBLEM WHEN THE ENTRANCE ROAD IS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE VISIBILITY IS POOR
I PARTICULARLY LIKE THE HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE VISABILITY AND 18 WHEELS WHICH GIVE A STOUT RIDE EXCELLENT GROUND CLEARANCE AND SUPHERB EASE OF ENTRY AND EXIT
THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT SIDE
LOVE THE FRONT VISIBILITY
SOMETIMES SEEMS A LITTLE HARD TO SEE BLIND SPOT AREAS WHEN CHANGING LANES NOT A PROBLEM THOUGH I JUST PAY EXTRA ATTENTION PRIOR TO CHANGING LANES
VISIBILITY SLIGHTLY OBSTRUCTED BY THE REAR HEAD RESTS
VISORS COULD BE SLIGHTLY BIGGER SEVERAL BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVER SEAT
DRIVER SIDE PILLAR CAN BE A BLIND SPOT
NO REAL BLIND SPOTS FOR A LARGER VEHICLE
THIS IS MY SECOND MITSUBISHI MIRAGE IN 4 MONTHS A DEER RAN INTO THE SIDE OF MY NEW CAR AFTER ONLY 6 WEEKS IT COMPLETELY TORE OFF THE FRONT FENDER AND DESTROYED THE WHOLE DRIVERS SIDE IT WAS TOTALED BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY I CAN PUSH ON THE OU
WINDSHIELD WIPERS OPERATE VERY WELL
THERE IS A VERY BIG BLIND SPOT ON BOTH SIDES YOUR HEAD HAS GOT TO REALLY TURN ON BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT
CAR IS SO SMALL AND VISIBILITY IS GREAT
REAR VIEW IS NOT GOOD
REAR BLIND SPOTS ARE HUGE NEEDED TO PASTE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON THE SIDE MIRRORS
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT LOOKING OVER RIGHT SHOULDER
DUE TO THE SHAPE OF THE VEHICLE THERE IS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES THAT REQUIRES ME TO USE THE SIDE MIRRORS AND THE PASSENGER TO HELP WITH VISIBILITY
HAS BIG BLIND SPOT ON LEFT
JUST THE BLIND SPOT IS AN ISSUE
DRIVER LEFT OVER SHOULDER VISIBILITY POOR
POOR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING
PROPER POSITIONAL USE OF REAR VIEW AND SIDE MIRRORS REDUCE 3 4 REAR VIEW ISSUE BACKUP CAMERA ELIMINATES REAR VIEW CONSTRAINTS WHEN IN REVERSE GEAR DAY OR NIGHT
GOOD FRONT VISIBILITY POOR REAR AND AVERAGE ONLY SIDE VISIBILITY
SERIOUS BLIND SPOT IN THE B AND C DRIVER SIDE PILLARS THE SIDE WINDOW IS USELESS TO SEE OUT OF WHEN CHANGING LANES
BLIND SPOT IS APPARENT AND THE SAFETY BACK UP CAMERA IS A GREAT FEATURE
REAR VIEW MONITOR RESOLUTION IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE
I ADDED SOME CONVEX MIRRORS TO AID IN SEEING VEHICLES WHILE CHANGING LANES
TAKES A LOT OF HEAD MOVEMENT BEFORE CHANGING LANES MANY BLIND SPOTS
HAS A BIG BLIND SPOT NEEDS THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION
NOTHING MORE THAN I ADORE THE ABILITY TO SEE ALL AROUND ME WITH MINIMAL EFFORT SO MUCH SAFER THAN ALL THE REALLY BAD BLIND SPOTS OF OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE EVER DRIVEN
WHEN THE SUN IS SETTING BEHIND ME THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM WILL REFLECT DIRECT SUNLIGHT INTO MY FACE MAKING IT HARD TO SEE SOMETIMES I WONDER IF THEY COULD ADD A COVER TO PULL DOWN OVER THE GLASS OF THE NAVIGATION SCREEN SO THAT IT DOESN T CREATE A
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BUILT IN MAGNIFICATION MIRROR ON BOTH OUTSIDE MIRRORS TO HELP WITH BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY
IN THE SITUATION WHERE I AM MERGING INTO A HIGHWAY LANE LEFT OF THE DRIVER S SIDE I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO TURN MY HEAD VERY FAR TO THE LEFT TO LOOK FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC IF I SIMPLY LOOK AT THE MIRRORS AND LOOK AT THE BLIND SPOT BUT SO
FORWARD VISIBILITY OVER FRONT HOOD MUCH IMPROVED OVER MODEL
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS THAT CAN REALLY MAKE FOR HAZARDOUS DRIVING FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE TO SWITCH LANES QUICKLY VISIBILITY CAN BE A PROBLEM
SOME BLIND SPOTS FROM LOOKING IF A CAR IS COMING WHEN CHANGING LANES WITHOUT HAVING TO TURN HEAD TO LOOK BACK OUT THE WINDOW
SLIGHT BLIND SPOT WHEN TURNING TO THE LEFT REAR CAMERA VERY HELPFUL BUT SLIGHT BLIND SPOT FROM THE RIGHT WHEN BACKING OUTSIDE OF CAMERA VISION
VERY HARD TO SEE OUT OF REAR WINDOWS SINCE THER IS NOT A DEFROST ON THEN REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE HARD TO SEE OUT OF WHEN IT IS COLD
MY 98 FRONTIER IS EASIER TO SEE OUT OF I ADDED SPOT MIRRORS AND AN AFTER MARKET REVERSE CAMERA
LARGE BLIND SPOT FOR CHANGING LANES ESP ON PASSENGER SIDE
THERE ARE A FEW BAD BLIND SPOTS CAUSED BY THE THICKNESS OF THE DOOR CAR FRAME
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS FROM BOTH MIRRORS
BACKUP AND 360 DEGREE CAMERAS ARE GREAT AND A BIG HELP WHEN PARALLEL PARKING
THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE FRONT LEFT FIELD OF VISION FOR THE DRIVER ISN T AS GREAT DUE TO THE BAR ABOVE THE SMALL WINDOW SOMETHING TO GET USED TO
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
WINDOW BAR ON LEFT INTERFERES WITH VISIBILITY IN LEFT CURVES
I LOVE DRIVING THIS CAR BUT I DO EXPERIENCE A SENSE THAT I CAN T QUITE SEE FORWARD TO MY LEFT SIDE BECAUSE THERE IS VERY THICK PIECE OF MOULDING AT THE EDGE OF THE WINDSHIELD WHICH BLOCKS VISIBILITY FOR CARS AND OTHER OBJECTS TO MY LEFT OBVIOUS
VISIBILITY WHEN CROSSING STREET CAN T SEE PEDESTRIANS LARGE PANEL BLINDSPOTS
BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING TO FRONT LEFT FROM DRIVER S SEAT
VISIBILITY OF BLIND SPOT AREA WHEN CHANGING LANES IS A LITTLE OBSTRUCTED SUN VISORS WOULD BENEFIT WITH EXTENSION PIECES TO HELP BLOCK SUN
LARGE BLIND SPOTS ON SIDE OF FRONT AND REAR WINDOWS
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY LARGE DUE TO THE SIDE MIRRORS AND DESIGN
I FIND THE FORWARD PLACEMENT OF THE WINDSHIELD PILLARS MAKES VISIBILITY DIFFICULT I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE MAKING RIGHT TURNS BECAUSE IT S HARD TO SEE ROAD EDGE AND CURB SOMETIMES IT S HARD TO SEE WHAT S IN THE LANE TO THE LEFT JUST AHEAD OF ME LO
I LIKE THE REAR VISIBILITY FEATURE WITH THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM BUT IT ISN T A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT THAN NORMAL CARS STILL HAVE TO LOOK FOR SAFETY I DO LIKE THE BEEP THAT THE SYSTEM DOES WHEN I M TOO CLOSE TO ANYTHING AS TO DRIVING SAFETY I
AUTOMATIC LANE WARNING SYSTEM IS GREAT
VISIBILITY IS ONE OF THE LEAST APPEALING FEATURES OF THE VEHICLE
BLIND SPOTS SOMETIMES
THIS VEHICLE HAS A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO CHANGE LANES
THERE IS DIFANTELY A HUGE BLIND SPOT IN THIS CAR DESPITE IS BEING COMPACT VERY SCARY
I LIKE BEING ABLE TO SEE ALL AROUND THE CAR I BARELY HAVE A BLIND SPOT
LOVE THE LIGHTS FOR BLIND SPOTS
SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS TILT DOWNWARD AUTOMATICALLY WHEN BACKING UP I DON T KNOW IF THIS IS A SETTING THAT CAN BE CHANGED WE BACK INTO OUR GARAGE SO WE HAVE TO MANUALLY ADJUST THE MIRRORS UPWARD SO WE CAN SEE THE GARAGE OPENING
VISIBILITY DEFICENCIES ARE MADE UP FOR BY THE OUTSTANDING CAMERA AND WARNING SYSTEMS
THE LEAF WITH ITS ADVANCED ELECTRIC DRIVE TRAIN DOESN T REALLY OFFER VERY MUCH IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL SAFETY FEATURES BEYOND THINGS LIKE AIRBAGS THE TOYOTA RAV4 I HAD BEFORE WITH BLIND SPOT DETECTION AND LANE DEPARTURE WARNING HAD MUCH MORE ADVA
I LOVE THE SAFETY LIGHTS ON THE DOORS IF SOMEONE IS IN THE BLIND SPOT HELPS A LOT TO AVOID ACCIDENTS DID I TELL YOU I LOVE THIS CAR
AS STATED PREVIOUSLY SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE AT NIGHT WHEN TURNING INTO DRIVEWAY NEEDS SIDE HEADLIGHT LIGHTING
THE SIDES OF THE HOOD COME UP AND IT S HARD TO JUDGE WHERE YOUR FENDER ENDS OR SEE CURBS WHEN YOU ARE TURNING RIGHT
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS BUT THE WARNING SAFETY FEATURE HELPS THAT
REAR WINDSHIELD TOO SMALL TO SEE HAVE TOO RELY ON BACKUP CAMERA
THE CAMERA S ON THE SIDE AND REAR OF VEHICLE THAT ALERT YOU THAT YOUR BLINDSIDE IS IS NOT CLEAR THE SAFETY FEATURES VEHICLE SLOWS DOWN WHEN IT DETECTS OTHER VEHICLE S IN FRONT SLOWING DOWN AND MY VEHICLE SLOWS AUTOMATICALLY ALSO LIKE THE AU
VEHICLE SEEMS BIGGER THEN MY WAS BUT MUCH MORE SOLID LOVE THAT HARD TO SEE OUT EVERY WINDOW BUT SAFETY FEATURES HELP WITH THAT
I THINK THE HEADLIGHTS ARE FANTASTIC FAR REACHING WITH EXCELLENT SIDE TO SIDE COVERAGE BETTER THAN MY G37 INFINITI I FEEL IT IS RIDICULOUS THAT A TOP OF THE LINE VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE RAIN SENSING WIPERS DITTO FOR THE INFINITI BOTH
I LOVE THE OVERHEAD VIEW OF THE CAMERA
I MISS HAVING SENSORS ON THE BACK TO TELL ME WHEN I AM NEAR SOMETHING NOW HAVE TO STARE AT THE CAMERA INSTEAD OF HEAD UP LOOKING AROUND
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THAT THE SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS FREQUENTLY CHANGE SETTING I NEED TO KNOW PRECISELY WHAT AREA A GIVEN MIRROR IS COVERING TO DO OTHERWISE IS TO INVITE AN ACCIDENT
I SEE GREAT OUT OF MY BLIND SPOT
THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THE 360 DEGREE BIRD S EYE VIEW OF THE AUTO WHILE IN REVERSE ARE BOTH BEYOND EXCEPTIONAL I WAITED FOR THIS CAR AND THE ELECTRONIC SAFETY FEATURES SURE ENOUGH WHEN I WAS A LITTLE TIRED WHILE DRIVING A COFFEE CUP ICON CAME
I FEEL THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WITH THE COLLISION WARNING AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS GREAT
BLIND SPOTS ON REAR MIRRORS
POTENTIAL FOR BLIND SPOT
WHILE VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT THE OTHER INSTALLED PROTECTIONS I E THE FLASHING WARNINGS AND BEEPS COMPENSATE FOR THE POOR VISIBILITY AS FOR THE WIPERS WASHERS WOLD HAVE PREFERRED NISSAN TO INCLUDE DEFROSTING WIPERS YOU CREATED A VERY NICE
THIS VEHICLE HAS VERY BAD BLINDS SPOTS ON EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT FLANK IT S ACTUALLY SCARY I WAS AT A STOP LIGHT AND COULD NOT SEE CARS ON EITHER SIDE I HAVE TO KEEP MY MIRRORS ADJUSTED WAY OUT AND STILL FEEL INSECURE I WILL BUY SOME BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY NOT AS GOOD AS THE 2004 MURANO
THE VEHICLE HAS BLIND SPOTS THAT YOU MUST BE AWARE OF WHEN DRIVING
HAVING MULTIPLE ELECTRONIC SAFETY AIDS IS A BIG PLUS
SIDE VISIBILITY ISN T GREAT I RELY ON THE TECHNOLOGY LANE DEPARTURE ETC TO HELP
SOME REAR QUARTER VISIBILITY ISSUES SIDE VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE LARGER
FORWARD VISIBILITY WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF THE HOOD SLANTED DOWN JUST A BIT MORE
WISH VEHICLE HAS INTERMITTENT WINDSHIELD WIPERS
IF I HAD TO PICK ONE THING ABOUT THE VEHICLE THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT THIS WOULD BE THE CATEGORY VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING IS EXCELLENT HOWEVER VISIBILITY FOR PARKING AND BEING ABLE TO DETERMINE WHERE THE CORNERS OF THE VEHICLE ARE SO YOU DON T
I FEEL LIKE THE SLOPE OF FRONT WINDSHIELD IS MORE DRAMATIC AND HAS MORE LIMITED VISIBILITY THAN IN PAST MURANOS THE SUN VISORS DON T GO ALL THE WAY OVER SO THERE ARE MOMENTS WHERE THE SUN COMES IN BETWEEN VISOR AND FRONT WINDSHIELD DIVIDER BETWE
VISIBILITY OUT FRONT WINDOW WHEN VISOR IS DOWN IS POOR
ODD SHAPE BODY MAKES IT HARD TO SEE ON THE SIDES HEAD REST IN THE BACK LIMIT THE VIEW OF THE BACK WINDOW FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
SMALL FRONT SIDE MIRROR CAUSES BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS A DEFINITE SECURITY PLUS
REAR PILLARS ARE TOO LARGE FOR GOOD VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES
BLIND SPOT IN LEFT LANE MUST CHECK CAREFULLY WHEN MERGING ONTO FREEWAY TRAFFIC
RIGHT SIDE VISIBILITY IS SOMETIMES BLOCKED WHEN PASSENGER SEAT IS OCCUPIED
THE VISIBILITY SEEING FORWARD AND THE HEADLIGHTS MAKE IT GREAT TO SEE IN ALL CONDITIONS EVEN AT NIGHT IN THE RAIN
THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS FOR ME AS A PERSON 5 3 I HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF CLOSE CALLS WHEN CHANGING LANES DUE TO LACK OF VISABLITY
LEFT BLIND SPOT VIEWING FROM IS A LITTLE CHALLENGE AT TIME AND A TALL DRIVER HAS TO LEAN FORWARD FOR BETTER VIEW JUST TURNING YOUR HEAD LOOKS STRAIGHT INTO THE DOOR FRAME
IT S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE THE PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT WHILE DRIVING EVEN AFTER TURNING MY HEAD
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCK SOME OF THE FORWARD VISION ALSO AS LOW AS YOU SIT INSIDE THE VEHICLE YOU GET A SMALLER WINDOW OF VIEW OUT THE REAR WINDOW OF COURSE THE REAR VIEW ISSUE IS NOT AN ISSUE WHEN THE CONVERTIBLE TOP IS DOWN
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE REALLY BED WHEN CHANGING LANES OR BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPOTS
I FIND IT HARD TO SEE WHEN BACKING UP MAYBE I M USED TO THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IN MY OTHER CAR
VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING IS SURPRISINGLY VERY GOOD
SUNVISORS COULD BE LONGER TO COVER MORE OF THE WINDSHIELD IN BRIGHT SUN THERE IS A PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT THAT MIRRORS MISS
NEEDS BLIND SPOT SENSORS
BEING A CONVERTIBLE IT DOES HAVE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACES TO SEE IF OTHER CARS ARE COMING
I WISH I COULD LOWER THE REAR HEADRESTS ALL THE WAY WHEN NO ONE IS SITTING BACK THERE SO AS TO IMPROVE THE VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IN THE FRONT BLOCKS A LOT OF THE VIEW WHEN TURNING RIGHT
GREAT THAT THERE IS NOW A SIDE SUN VISOR BUT IT DOES NOT DROP DOWN ENOUGH
WOULD PREFER SLIGHTLY LONGER SUN VISORS
REAR VIEW MIRROR YOU GET GHOST IMAGES AT TIMES ESPECIALLY IF PASSENGER HAS MAP LIGHT ON
SOME BLOCKAGE OF VISIBILITY DUE TO LARGE SIDE MIRRORS
BETTER VISIBILITY REAR VIEW MIRROR DON T LIKE THE SHAPE OF FRONT HEAD LIGHTS UPSIDE DOWN U
IT IS HARD TO SEE THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW WHEN BACKING UP I DON T LIKE TOTALLY RELYING ON THE CAMERA
LARGE BLIND SPOTS WHEN SWITCHING LANES
HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK SOMETIMES AND LIMITED SIDE VIEW HAVE LANE ASSIST AND HAVE FOUND THAT VERY HELPFUL AS WELL AS THE REARVIEW CAMERA
IT S A GOOD THING TO HAVE THE LANE ASSIST WARNING SYSTEM I HAVE COME TO RELY ON IT BECAUSE OF THE BLIND SPOTS
BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE THE BACK UP WARNING SYSTEM THERE ARE SOME BLIND TYPE SPOTS WHEN REVERSING
I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO SEE OUT BACK SEAT SIDE WINDOWS THERE IS NOT ENOUGH GLASS IN THOSE AREAS AND I DEPEND ON THE SIDE MIRRORS MORE THAN OTHER CARS I VE DRIVEN
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN TURNING LEFT FROM THE FRONT WINDSHIELD
MANY BLIND SPOTS
SOMETIMES THE DRIVER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS A BIT OF MY VIEW
I CAN SEE VERY GOOD OUT THE FRONT AND REAR WINDOWS THE HEAD LIGHTS ARE GREAT AND THE REAR CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL
I HATE THAT IT DOESN T COME WITH DAYLIGHT RUNNING LIGHTS IF I KNEW THIS BEFORE I BOUGHT THE CAR I WOULD HAVE UPGRADED TO GET THEM I ASSUMED ALL CARS HAD THEM AT THIS POINT
JUST FEAR SAFETY IF IN COLLISION AND EXCESSIVE DAMAGE IF I WAS HIT BECAUSE OF MATERIAL OUTSIDE PANELS OF CAR ARE MADE OF
THE JUKE HAS THE BEST VISIBILITY OF ANY CAR I VE OWNED
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT THE SAFEST SUN VISOR DOES NOT ALWAYS DO ITS JOB BUT I LIKE HOW MANY WINDOWS THERE ARE IT MAKES FOR SWITCHING LANES EASY
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE BLIND SPOTS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BECAUSE OF THE DESIGN OF THE REAR WINDOW
BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
I AM SHORT SO HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE SUN AROUND THE VISORS THERE NEEDS TO BE ONE TO PULL OUT AROUND THE MIRROR ALSO SOMETIMES HAVE TROUBLE SEEING AROUND THE POSTS IN FRONT I DEPEND A LOT ON THE CAMERA LOVE IT
BLIND SPOT WHEN MERGING ON PASSENGER REAR SIDE SUN VISOR CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE IT HANGS TO LOW WHEN SEAT IS ALL THE WAY UP
THERE IS TOO MUCH DISTANCE BETWEEN SIDE WINDOW AND FRONT WINDSHIELD WITH NO GLASS I VERY FREQUENTLY CAN NOT SEE ROAD LINES OR TRAFFIC FOR A FEW SECONDS WHEN TURNING LEFT BUT I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE REAR CAMERA
THIS IS A HIGH TECH AND SAFE CAR AND I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT WHEN MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER DRIVES IT
BLIND SPOT LEFT REAR WHEN MERGING MIRROR DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH VIEW OCCASIONS OF WHERE DID YOU COME FROM ALSO ON RIGHT SIDE
VISIBILITY IS GOOD
HARD TO BACK UP WITHOUT CAMARA JUST GOT USE TO THE ONE IN TOYOTA
THEY NEED TO PUT A REAR CAMERA & A CHANGE LANE CAMERA ON XTERRA S
VISORS SHOULD BE EXPANDABLE WHEN BRIGHT SUN AFFECTS VISIBILITY
BACK UP CAMERA SHOULD HAVE AUDIBLE ALERTS
THE CAR CANNOT BE DRIVEN WITHOUT CONSTANT USE OF BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE MIRRORS SINCE THE SEAT SIZE BLOCKS MOST OF THE REAR VISION
FRONT AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS THE BEST OF ANY CAR I VE BEEN IN OR DRIVEN
SIDE MIRRORS COULD HAVE MORE FIELD VISIBILITY
THE CAR HAS GREAT VISABILITY YOU CAN SEE EVRY WHERE AROUND THE CAR AND THE ONLY SPOT OVER THE SHOULDER IS EASILY SEEN THROUGH THE SIDE MIRROR
SUN VISORS ARE MARGINAL SHOULD BE SOMEWHAT LARGER OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ALTHOUGH LARGE WOULD WORK BETTER IF MOUNTED FURTHER FORWARD ON THE CAR THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES EVEN WITH THE LARGE MIRROR SIZE
IT IS HARD TO SEE VEHICLES IN OTHER LANES THAT ARE APPROXIMATELY AT THE BRZ S REAR 1 3 1 4 BLIND SPOT IS A BIT MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE OWNED
THE BLIND SPOT IS TRICKY I REALLY HAVE TO TURN MY HEAD AND TAKE A GOOD LOOK TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NO ONCOMING CAR
THE REAR OF THE FRAME MAKES IT CHALLENGING TO LOOK TOWARD BLIND SPOTS TO CHANGE LANES BACK UP ETC
WHEN THE DRIVER SUN VISOR IS DOWN IT BLOCKS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE BRZ HAS A VERY SMALL REAR WINDOW MAKING FOR A VERY LARGE BLIND SPOT YOU REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT S IN FRONT AND BEHIND YOU TO MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF VISABILITY ON THE REAR LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES
WIDER SUN VISORS
REAR COLUMNS OBSTRUCT BLIND SPOT UNLESS YOU HAVE A FLEXIBLE NECK
MY PROBLEM WITH THE VISIBILITY IS PARTICULARLY WITH BEING ABLE TO SEE OUR OF THE PASS REAR WINDOW BECAUSE OF THE HIGH HEAD REST ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE SEAT I AM ONLY 5 FEET TALL AND MY HUSBAND IS 6 4 SO WHEN HE SITS IN THE PASS SIDE SEAT H
PERIPHERAL VISIBILITY EITHER WHEN MOVING FORWARD OR BACKING UP IS STILL LIMITED
THIS IS IN COMPARISON TO MY OLD 98 HONDA ODYSSEY WHICH HAD SUPER WONDERFUL VISABILITY
I WISH I DIDN T HAVE TO KEEP THE REAR WIPER ON ALL THE TIME WHEN RAINING
I DON T CARE FOR THE BACK UP CAMERA I KNOW THEY WILL BE IN ALL VEHICLES SOON BUT I DON T THINK IT WILL MAKE THINGS BETTER IT WAS VERY DISTRACTING FOR A COUPLE WEEKS UNTIL I GOT USED TO IT AFTER THAT I STOPPED USING IT AT ALL I GUESS THERE ARE
THE VISIBILITY OF THE SUBARU FORESTER IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL AS IS THE SAFETY OF THE CAR THESE ARE TWO OF THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT LEAD ME TO PURCHASE THIS CAR
I HAVE TROUBLE SEEING AROUND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND RAIN LIGHT SENSOR
IT DRIVES EXCEPTIONALLY WELL IN SNOW THE VISIBILITY IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE VISIBILITY OVERALL IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER VEHICLES IN THIS CLASS THAT I HAVE DRIVEN
I RECOGNIZE THAT THE WINDSHIELD MUST HAVE SUPPORT ON THE SIDES BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE SIDE BARS WERE SLIGHTLY SMALLER TO ALLOW EVEN MORE VISIBILITY ON SHARP WINDING ROADS ONE MUST ADJUST ONES HEAD LEAN FORWARD TO ENSURE VISIBILITY AROUND
VISIBILITY WAS THE REASON I CHOSE THE XTERRA OVER THE TOYOTA FJ CRUISER
BETTER SIDE MIRRORS FOR VISIBILITY
SOMETHING OF A BLINDSPOT WHEN LOOKING OUT THE REAR SIDES BUT THE LANE CHANGE ASSIST TAKES CARE OF IT IT IS SOMETHING THAT TAKES A LITTLE GETTING USED TO
SIDE VISIBILITY TO THE REAR IS A LEARNED BEHAVIOR THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS TO THE REAR BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT
REAR VIEW CAMERA SHOULD BE MADE STANDARD OR AT THE VERY LEAST AS AN AVAILABLE OEM OPTION
EXTREMELY LARGE BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE DUE TO LACK OF WINDOW GLASS ON PASSENGER SIDE OF HATCHBACK PLUS SIDE MIRROR HAS VERY LARGE BLIND SPOT AS WELL MAKES IT SO I HAVE TO CHECK OVER MY SHOULDER 3 OR 4 TIMES BEFORE CHANGING LANES TO THE RIG
I LOVE THE VISIBILITY IN THIS CAR
THE SUBARU CRASH TEST RESULTS WERE A BIG CONSIDERATION FOR ME
THOUGHT DRIVER SIDE SUN VISOR A LITTLE TOO WIDE WHEN I DROP IT DOWN I FIND IT DOES BLOCK MY FRONT WINDOW VIEW WHILE DRIVING SO I HAVE TO LEAVE IT ALWAYS AT AN ANGLE
IT WOULD ALL BE OUTSTANDING IF THEY USED A CONVEX MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
THE LEFT AND RIGHT PANELS FROM THE BODY OF THE CAR THAT FRAME THE WINDSHIELD OBSCURE VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT THOUGH THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH MOST CARS
LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA
THE REARMOST SIDE WINDOWS TEND TO DECREASE SIDE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES
IT S HARD TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN REAR AND BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY CHECKS AND SAFE VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE I HAVE TO JIGGLE AROUND A LOT TO CHECK THE BLIND SPOTS BECAUSE THERE S QUITE A BIT OF WINDOW FRAMEWORK IN MY VISUAL RANGE NOT SURE IF T
EYESIGHT BLIND SPOT WARNING COLLISION AVOIDANCE AND REAR OBSTACLE WARNING TOTALLY ENHANCE THE SAFETY OF DRIVING ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL MAKES INTERSTATE DRIVING A DREAM
LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA BUT WISH IT HAD BLIND SPOT FEATURE
BLIND SPOT IS PRONOUNCED ON DRIVER SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE NOT GOOD WITH JUST MIRRORS
THE SUBARU IMPREZA IS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SEE IN REAR VIEW MIRROR AND SIDE MIRRORS GOOD VISIBILITY AND SAFETY ARE A TOP PRIORITY AND THE FIRST THING I CHECK WHEN SEEING ABOUT GETTING A NEW VEHICLE
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS LEAVE SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED BUT ARE FINE
I WISH IT HAD THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION FEATURE I EXPERIENCED IT IN THE LEGACY IT WAS VERY HELPFUL I ALSO WISH IT HAD THE DETECTION SYSTEM FOR OBJECTS PASSING BEHIND THE VEHICLE OTHER THAN THAT I M EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THE CAR AND FEEL T
GREAT VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY IS THE BEST OF ALL CARS I LOOKED AT
THIS CAR DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF THE TRADITIONAL BLIND SPOTS THAT MOST SPORTS CARS DO THE REAR PASSENGER WINDOWS ARE ACTUALLY USEFUL FOR SEEING INTO YOUR BLIND SPOT A LOT OF THE SAFETY OF THIS CAR IS IN HOW WELL IT HANDLES
THIS VEHICLE IS VERY SAFE MY REAR BUMPER WAS HIT FROM THE SIDE BY A SPEEDING CAR IN AN INTERSECTION AND I NEVER SAW IT COMING THE BUMPER FLEW OFF I SPUN OUT 180 DEGREES THE WINDOW PASSENGER AIRBAGS DEPLOYED NO PASSENGER MY HEAD SWUNG SIDEW
FRONT VISABILITY IS GREAT REALLY BAD BLIND SPOTS AT REAR SIDES SUN VISORS DEFINITELY NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR SAFETY
VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND LIKE THE EYESIGHT FEATURE
BLIND SPOT WARNING INDICATORS SHOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO FRAME OF CAR DOOR MAKING THEM MORE VISIBKE TO DRIVER ALSO WHILE MY SEATS ARE IVORY FLOOR CAROET IS BLACK WITH NO OPTION TO CHOOSE ANOTHER COLOR TOO MUCH BLACK BLACK CARPETS HOLD DIRT BL
BEST REAR VISIBILITY OF ANY CROSS OVER OR SUV
REAR VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED
THIS VEHICLE FEELS SAFE AN SOLID WHEN DRIVING IN COLD SNOW COVERED ROAD CONDITIONS BOTH THE ENGINE AND INTERIOR WARM UP QUICKLY AFTER START UP THE DRIVER HASN T EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEM WITH VISIBILITY OR BLIND SPOTS
REFLECTIONS IN THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
I FEEL THE REAR WINDSHIELD IS SMALL AND DOESN T ALLOW FOR SUPERB VISIBILITY MOST ESPECIALLY WHEN THE REAR HEADRESTS ARE UP THE SIDE WINDOWS ARE ALSO A BIT SMALL ACCEPTABLE BUT COULD BE A BIT LARGER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM WORKS WELL AND REAR BACKUP CAMERA HAS SHARP PICTURE
EYESIGHT SYSTEM IS TERRIFIC FEATURE
IN THE TOP TRIM LEVEL LIMITED HID HEADLIGHTS ARE STANDARD ON THE 3 5 6CYL AND NOT AVAILABLE ON THE 2 54CYL IN THE US IN OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS CANADA THEY ARE AVAILABLE NOT ACCEPTABLE IMO
I THINK A SMALL BLINDSPOT MIRROR SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ON THE OUTSIDE DRIVERS MIRROR MUCH LIKE IS ON THE FORD FUSION ON I DRIVE FOR MY COMPANY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE TOP RIGHT CORNER OF OUTSIDE DRIVERS MIRROR
THE HEADLAMPS WORK EXCEPTIONALLY WELL BUT PERHAPS THEY WORK A LITTLE TOO WELL THE HIGH BEAMS LIGHT UP A SIGNIFIGANT PORTION OF THE ROAD AHEAD BUT THE REFLECTION FROM ROAD SIGNS CAN DAZZLE ME THERE IS ALSO A BLIND SPOT CREATED BY THE B PILL
I REALLY LIKE THE FEELING OF SAFETY I GET FROM MY OUTBACK I HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THAT IN A VEHICLE BEFORE
BLIND SPOT MONITOR AND BACKUP REAR COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM VERY EFFECTIVE
KEEP THE TALL ROOF LINE AND THIN REAR PILLAR IN FUTURE MODELS DON T GO FOR ALL THAT SLANTED STYLING I BOUGHT CAR BECAUSE OF VISIBILITY 4 WHEEL DRIVE STYLING AND 6 CYLINDER ENGINE ALL ARE RELATED TO SAFETY
REAR HEADRESTS OBSCURE REAR VISION
I LIKE THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS INTUITIVE TO USE AND WORKS VERY WELL THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION AND BACK UP RADAR DETECTION SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL THE EYE SIGHT FEATURE WAS SOMETHING THAT I INSISTED ON AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SYSTEM THERE ARE A F
I LIKE THE SMALL WINDOWS NEAR THE REAR VIEW MIRROR ADDS ADDITIONAL VISIBILITY
THE BLIND SPOTS SEEM BIGGER ON THIS CAR LAST CAR WAS A MADZA MPV AND I HAD TO REPLACE THE WIPERS WITH A BETTER QUALITY BLADE BUT PASSENGER SIDE DOES NOT GET CLEARED ENOUGH WITH CURRENT PATTERN OF WIPING THE OLD MADZA SWEPT FROM THE INSIDE TO
REMARKABLY FUNCTIONAL DESIGN WITH GREAT SIGHT LINES AND IMPRESSIVE SAFETY FEATURES AND TEST RESULTS FOR THE PRICE OF THE CAR
I LIKE THE NEW POSITION OF THE SIDE MIRRORS SEEMS TO MINIMIZE THE BLIND SPOT
I THINK THAT THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AS WELL AS THE VEHICLE WARNING SIGNALS AND SLOW DOWN ARE VERY IMPORTANT FACTORS IN WHY I LIKE MY SUBARU SO MUCH
I CAN T SING THE PRAISES OF EYESIGHT ENOUGH IT S THE REASON I BOUGHT THE CAR AND IT HAS NOT DISAPPOINTED I CAN T IMAGINE OWNING ANOTHER DAILY VEHICLE WITHOUT THAT EXTRA SET OF SENSORS KEEPING AN EYE ON THINGS FOR ME I VE NEVER FELT SAFER ON CRO
I REALLY LIKE SUBARU EYESIGHT FEATURE AND REAR VEHICLE DETECTION ALSO
WE LOVE THE FEATURE THAT KEEPS US A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE CAR IN FRONT OF US WHEN WE HAVE THE CRUSE CONTROL ON WE ALSO LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA AND DISPLAY
REAR VISIBILITY HAS BEEN A GREATER PROBLEM THAN I EXPECTED STILL BETTER THAN SOME OTHER CARS I TEST DROVE BUT NOT AS GOOD AS MY PREVIOUS CAR A SEDAN
FRONT WIPER BLADES ARE TERRIBLE AND DO NOT CLEAN OR MOVE WATER WELL
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR AND AUTO DIMMING MIRRORS
BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED
THE AWD ABS AND TRACTION CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE FANTASTIC IN THE SNOW
THE VISIBILITY IS BETTER IN THE LEGACY THAN IN SOME OTHER SEDANS
HEADLIGHTS SEEM LIKE THEY ARE OFF WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT THEY AREN T VERY BRIGHT ON THE ROAD IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE CAR THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING THE WATER OFF THE WINDSHIELD DURING A HEAVY DOWNPOUR TO WHERE VISIBILIT
I LOVE THE FEELING OF SAFETY THIS CAR INSTILLS FOR MY FAMILY
AUTOMATIC BRAKING IN CRUISE CONTROL IS AMAZING
NEEDS A BSM OPTION
I CAN SEE ALL AROUND ME MUCH BETTER THAN MY LAST 2 NEW CARS THE BIG WINDSHIELD IS GREAT AND THE FRONT DOORS ARE LONG ENOUGH THAT THERE IS LOTS OF VISIBILITY THROUGH THE SIDE WINDOWS
BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT SIDE REAR SEEING UPCOMING TRAFFIC THRU BOTH THE SIDE AND REAR VIEW MIRROR REALLY HAVE TO BE CONSCIOUS OF IT
BLINDSPOT
SLOPE OF REAR WINDOW AND SMALL SIDE WINDOWS IN THE CARGO AREA MAKE FOR LIMITED VISIBILITY WHEN HAVING TO CHANGE LANES RAPIDLY CONVEX BLIND SPOT MIRRORS AFFIXED TO OUTSIDE MIRRORS WOULD HELP A LOT SUN VISOR IS NOT AS WIDE AS SIDE WINDOWS SO PUL
THE AMOUNT OF SPACE BETWEEN THE LAST SIDE WINDOW AND THE WINDOW IN THE TAILGATE IS TOO GREAT IT MAKES THE BLIND SPOT FOR MOVING A LANE TO THE RIGHT TOO LARGE OUR OLD LEGACY STATION WAGON WAS BETTER IN THIS RESPECT
VISIBILITY IS GOOD
COMPARED TO MY OLD CAR 2 DOOR 92 HONDA ACCORD THE VISIBILITY IS A BIT WORSE PARTICULARLY FOR LANE CHANGES WITH THE DOOR SEPARATOR IN PLACE THERE I THINK THIS WOULD BE TRUE OF ANY 4 DOOR CAR THOUGH COMPARED TO A 2 DOOR
I LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA
WHILE CHANGING LANES AND LOOKING OVER PACK RIGHT CORNER BEHIND 2ND ROW SEAT THERE IS A SMALL BLIND SPOT THAT OFTEN LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER VEHICLE
VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE LED HEADLIGHTS FOR VISIBILITY AND LED DAY LIGHT ACCENTS FOR A SHARP MODERN LOOK
THE BLIND SPOT IS AN ISSUE
I WILL BE REPLACING THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS IN BAD WEATHER THE ICE WAS FREEZING TO THEM I HAD TO STOP NUMEROUS TIMES TO GET THE ICE OFF SO I COULD SEE
I AM STILL GETTING USE TO CONTROL FEATURE LIKE THE CRUZ CONTROL AND I DO NOT USE THE MANUAL CONTROLS AND I FEEL THE CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL INTERFERS WITH THE VISABLITY OF THE WIPER CONTROLS
JUST A LITTLE ISSUE WHEN I ADJUST THE STEERING WHEEL TO MY MOST COMFORTABLE POSITION I CAN NOT SEE THE 50 70 MPH RANGE VERY WELL ON THE SPEEDOMETER NOT A BIG ISSUE WITH THE CRUISE CONTROL ON
I LOVE THE COMBINATION OF THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE AND THE HIGH GROUND CLEARANCE I M SHORT SO VISIBILITY IS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE THIS CAR HAS A SOLID FEEL FOR THE ROAD AND A REASSURING FEELING OF SAFETY ALL WHILE BEING FUN TO DRIVE
IT WOULD BE NICE IF BLIND SPOT MONITORING WERE STANDARD
THE BACK TRIANGULAR WINDOW OFTEN LOOKS LIKE A CAR IN MY LANE OTHER THAN THAT THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A BIT DIFFICULT TO ADJUST DUE TO THE EYESIGHT UNIT
I WISH THIS MODEL CAME WITH THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION MONITORS IN THE MIRRORS IT HAS SEVERAL OTHER SAFETY FEATURES IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THIS TO BE AVAILABLE AS WELL
EVEN THOUGH IT HAS A BACK UP CAMERA I STILL TURN AROUND AND LOOK BEFORE BACKING UP IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE EVERYTHING WHEN DOING THAT I LOVE THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE AND FEEL VERY CONFIDENT AND SAFE WHEN GOING AROUND CORNERS ESPECIALLY
WHEN I DRIVE AT NIGHT HEADLIGHT FROM ONCVOMING WHEIKLES ESPECIALY ON TWO WAY ROAD ALMOST BLIND ME I DONT KNOW WHAT CHANGES IN COMPOSITION OF WINDSHILD GLASS YOU MADE BUT THIS DID NOT HAPPEN I MY PREVIOUSLI 2 SUBARY
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING
WOULD PREFER GREATER SIDE VISIBILITY THE BACK WINDOW COULD BE LARGER AS WELL
IT S A LITTLE HARD TO SEE AROUND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD THAT MIGHT BE BECAUSE I M TALL
PROXIMITY SENSORS IN BUMPERS COULD BE HELPFUL BUT BLIND SPOT MIRRORS WITHIN THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS WOULD REALLY HELP
I DO HAVE BLIND SPOTS AT TIMES
EYE SIGHT ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL IS GREAT
THE FACT THAT THE REAR WIPERS BECOME CONSTANT WHEN IN REVERSE IS A PLUS
THIS IS MY ISSUE IT IS HARD TO SEE BLINDSPOT AND THE REAR WHEN I AM ONLY 5 2 I DO GET TO TURN MY HEAD ALL THE WAY THOUGH AS ANYONE SHOULD SUN VISORS DOESN T WORK FOR ME TOO SHORT P I USE MY HAND TO BLOCK THE SUN OR WEAR SUNGLASSES TO
THE DRIVERS SIDE BLIND SPOT IS VERY LARGE
I TEST DROVE ABOUT FOUR VEHICLES AND THIS ONE HAD THE BEST VISIBILITY WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY I BOUGHT THIS CAR I ALSO ENJOY THE BACKUP CAMERA AND I THINK THERE SHOULD BE A FUNCTION TO VIEW BEHIND THE CAR THROUGH THE BACK UP CAMERA WHILE DRIVING
THE NUMBER AND PLACEMENT OF THE AIRBAGS IS EXCEPTIONAL EVEN OUR DOGS IN THE CARGO AREA WITH THE BACK SEATS FOLDED DOWN ARE PROTECTED
BLIND SPOTS ARE ALMOST NON EXISTENT
I AM USED TO THE OUTBACK WHICH HAS LARGER WINDOWS I FIND THAT THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOTS AND I REALLY HAVE TO USE MY MIRRORS AND LOOK FOR CHANGING LANES
A COUPLE OF TIMES I HAVE NOT SEEN CARS COMING FROM THE RIGHT EVEN AFTER LOOKING CAREFULLY I M NOT SURE IF IT IS A BLIND SPOT OR ME
I WISH THE BACK WINDSHIELD WIPER COVERED A LARGER SURFACE AREA
REAR WINDOW WIPER DOESN T CLEAR LARGE ENOUGH AREA AND CONVENTIONAL WINDOW WASHERS AT THE GAS STATIONS CAN T FIT TO CLEAN THE TOP OF THE REAR WINDOW
VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING BACK TO PASSENGER SIDE IS PARTIALLY BLOCKED BY PASSENGER SIDE HEAD REST
LOVE THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IT AS A BIG FACTOR IN MY PURCHASE
STANDARD HID HEADLIGHTS WOULD BE GREAT
POOR LIGHT OUTPUT FROM HEADLIGHTS
VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT LANE CHANGE WARNINGS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN EYESIGHT
BLIND SPOT IS TERRIBLE NO BLIND SPOT INDICATOR NOR A BLIND SPOT MIRROR I HAVE TO CHECK TWICE BEFORE CHANGING LANES
WE HAVE OWNED A SUBARU SINCE 1996 FOR WHERE WE LIVE IT S THE ONLY VEHICLE FOR US GREAT MPG GREAT SAFETY AND GREAT HANDLING IN SNOW AND ICE
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS TO BE PLACED SLIGHTLY TOO LOW FOR A TALL DRIVER CREATING A BLIND SPOT THAT I HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO WORK AROUND
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE FORD SIDE MIRRORS WITH THE BLIND SPOT VIEW
REAR VISIBILITY SUCKS AT LEAST PUT A HOLE IN THE HEADREST CAMERA TRIES TO COMPENSATE DURING REVERSE BUT NO GOOD FOR LANE CHANGES
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE NOTICED IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE REAR WINDOW TINTING IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE AN APPROACHING VEHICLE IN THE BLIND SPOT
WISH I HAD BLIND SPOT MONITORS
BLIND SPOTS ARE NOT GREAT
ABSOLUTELY NO COMPLAINTS FOR VISIBILITY EXTREMELY GOOD VISIBILITY OF ROAD AND OTHER CARS FROM ALL DRIVING VIEWS
THE ADDITION OF THE WINDOW AT THE A PILLAR AND MOVING THE MIRROR DOWN IS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT IN VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY IS GREAT FOR A MODERN SEDAN BUT THE BASE MODEL HEADLIGHTS ARE LACKING IN EFFECTIVENESS
THE BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS GREAT I M ALWAYS ON THE HIGHWAY AND I VE NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES
ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF DRIVING IS SEEING THE WING IN THE REAR VIEW
I WISH THE CAR HAD CAMERA S ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES FOR PASSING
REAR CAMERA IS GREAT UNFORTUNATLY IT S ALSO NECCESARY AS BACKING UP WITHOUT USING IT CAN BE HAZARDOUS AS IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE THE REAR AREA OF THE CAR WITHOUT IT
THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS A MUST WITHOUT THE CAMERA THERE WOULD BE BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR HOWEVER THE CAMERA HAS AN AMAZING WIDE ANGLE IMAGE DISPLAY SO YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO WHILE BACKING UP
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY HAD INTEGRATED THE REAR CENTER BRAKE LIGHT INTO THE WING TO PROVIDE BETTER REAR VISIBILITY
THE BLIND SPOT WARNING IS A BLESSING
WHOMEVER DESIGNED THE WINDOWS DID THE BEST JOB OF ANY VEHICLE I HAVE EVER DRIVEN YOU CAN SEE VERY CLEAR AROUND YOU I DON T HAVE THAT BLIND SPOT I HAVE HAD DRIVING OTHER BRANDS
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO LARGE REDUCING VISIBILITY TO RIGHT
GREAT STYLING DOES SACRIFICE SOME REAR WINDOW VIEW AND SOME SIDE VIEW BUT NO MORE THAN SIMILAR SUV AND OTHER NEWER CAR MODELS WITH SIMILAR STYLING WITH THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS AND CAMERA VIEWS ON SCREEN IT DID NOT TAKE LONG TO ADJUST FROM MY OLD
THE BLIND SPOT TO THE RIGHT REAR IS STILL JUST AS BAD AS ALWAYS HOWEVER THE BLINDSPOT WARNING SYSTEM IN THIS VEHICLE IS A GODSEND
IF NOT FOR THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS CAR AS THE VISIBILITY THROUGH THE VERY SMALL REAR WINDOWS WOULD PRESENT A PROBLEM FOR ME ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS DARK
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING AND THINK IN THIS VEHICLE IT IS VERY NECESSARY
THE MURANO IS NOTORIOUS FOR ITS BLIND SPOTS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING DEVICE HAS REALLY HELPED WITH THAT THE ALL AROUND CAMERA SYSTEM IS SOMETHING I REALLY LIKE ALSO IT MAKES PARKING EASIER SEEING OBSTACLES AND I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT BEE
LOVE BLIND SIDE CAUTIONING SYSTEM
THE SAFETY FEATURE IS THE BEST
WIDE ROOF SUPPORTS ON LEFT AND RIGHT OF WINDSHIELD CAUSES BLIND SPOTS WHEN TURNING
VISIBILITY FROM PASSENGER SEAT COULD BE IMPROVED BY HAVING AN UP AND DOWN ADJUSTMENT ON THE POWER SEAT DASH IS A LITTLE HIGH FROM PASSENGER SEAT AND PASSENGER IS TALL
HEATED WINDSHIELD WIPERS
BLIND SPOT AT REAR AREA WHEN LOOKING NEEDS LARGER REAR CORNER GLASS SPACE
I WOULD LIKE DAY TIME RUNNING LIGHTS AND A PULL DOWN SEE THROUGH SUN VISOR CONTAINED WITHIN THE VISOR TO USE WHEN THE SUN IS DIRECTLY IN A DRIVING LANE
BACKED UP INTO ANOTHER VEHICLE BECAUSE I DID NOT SEE IT IN REAR VIEW MIRROR AND I AM NOT USED TO LOOKING AT THE BACK UP CAMERA
BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDE HARD TO SEE IF OTHER CARS ARE THERE EVEN WHEN USING MIRRORS
THE SIDE MIRRORS AND WARNING SYSTEM ARE CRUCIAL AS THERE ARE MANY BLIND SPOTS
TO BE FAIR THE VEHICLE SHAPE LIMITS REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY HOWEVER THE FRONT AND REAR CAMERAS PLUS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING FEATURE OVERCOMES THESE LIMITS WITH EXCELLENT TECHNOLOGY WHICH SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATES INTO THE DRIVING EXPERIENCE
I WOULD DAY LIGHT RUNNING LIGHTS
TO IMPROVE THE REAR VISIBILITY I HAD TO REMOVE THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS
BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS OUTSTANDING
NOT VERY GOOD VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK BUT THAT S WHY WE WANTED THE REAR BLIND SPOT MONITOR WHICH IS GREAT
YOU MUST RELY ON SIDE MIRRORS AND LANE WARNING LIGHTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
HARD TO HEAR THE LANE CHANGE BEEPS IF A CAR IS BESIDE YOU AND IT HAS BIG BLIND SPOTS
SHOULD PROVIDE FOR BETTER VISIBILITY FOR SHORT PEOPLE HARD TO SEE TO THE END OF THE HOOD REAR WINDOW SHAPE DOES NOT GIVE GOOD VISIBILITY OF TRAFFIC AND SAME WHEN CHANGING LANES SHOULD ALLOW RAISING THE SEAT AND AND STILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE CENTER SEAT HEADREST SECOND ROW HINDERS REAR VIEW FROM FRONT SEAT ESPECIALLY WHEN BACKING WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER
THE BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHTS ARE THE BEST THING TO EVER COME OUT
BLIND SPOTS WHEN USEING SIDE MIRRORS
VISIBILITY IS NOT TOO GOOD
CAMERA SYSTEMS ARE GREAT
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A LARGER HIGHER BACK WINDOW THERE IS A COUPLE BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER SEAT BECAUSE OF THE BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS IF THE REAR WINDOW WENT UP SLIGHTLY HIGHER IT WOULD HELP
WOULD LIKE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHT FEATURE SO I DO NOT HAVE TO TURN ON THE HEADLIGHTS
VISIBILITY IS GREAT WHILE DRIVING
BETWEEN THE LITTLE WINDOW AND THE FRONT WINDOW I FEEL THERE IS A BLIND SPOT
I FEEL LIKE IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO BE CONFIDENT ABOUT CHANGING LANES DUE TO LACK OF SEEING BLIND SPOT I EVEN BOUGHT AN EXTRA WIDE ANGLE CONCAVE MIRROR TO ADHERE TO THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR
DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS IN PASSENGER BLIND SPOT TOO MANY OBSTRUCTIONS LIKE PASSENGER HEAD REST AND BODY PANEL
I HAVE DRIVEN OTHER CARS BUT THIS ONE IS THE ONE FOR ME AND MY FAMILY I LOVE HOW SMOOTH IT DRIVES I LOVE THE VISIBILITY IT HAS WHEN SWITCHING LANES I CAN EASILY SAY THIS IS THE MOS COMFORTABLE CAR I HAVE DRIVEN I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO MA
THE CAMERA IN SIDE MIRROR SOMETIMES ERROR NO CAR BUT BLINKING
XENON HEAD LIGHTS WOULD BE A NICE OPTION
THIS MODEL HAS BETTER BLINDSPOTS THAN THE LAST PATHFINDER I HAD BUT I REALLY LIKE AND NEED THE BLINDSPOT WARNING SYSTEM IT HAS HELPED ME AVOID COLLISIONS
GREAT FORWARD VISIBILITY AND GREAT HEADLIGHTS
SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO HIGH WHEN TURNING THEY BLOCK OUT TOO MUCH AREA THERE COULD BE PEDESTRIAN AND YOU WOULD NOT SEE THEM
REAR WINDOW A BIT SMALL BUT LUCK TO HAVE GOTTEN BACK UP CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOTS BUT NOT SO MANY THAT I CAN T SEE
WHEN TURNING R TO GO DOWN A RAMP IN PARKING GARAGE VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES COMING UP THE RAMP IS REDUCED DUE TO THE A PILLAR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE
STILL GETTING USE TO THE REAR CAMERA I LIKE THE FEATURE ESPECIALLY SINCE I FIND THE REAR WINDSHIELD DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF FOR REVERSING
REAR WINDOW SHAPE CUTS OFF SOME VISIBILITY ALSO THE SECOND ROW CAPTION SEATS CUT OFF SOME VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS LEFT BACK SIDE
VISIBILITY IS NOT VERY GOOD WHEN MAKING A SHARP LEFT TURN AS THE LARGE OUTSIDE REARVIEW MIRROR AND WINDSHIELD PILLAR OBSTRUCT THE VIEW
FORWARD VISIBILITY IS TRICKY BECAUSE FRONT OF CAR A A LITTLE LONG MAKES PARKING A TINY BIT DIFFICULT FOR SOME
TERRIFIC BLIND SPOTS ON R AND L SIDES HARD TO GET THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ADJUSTED TO MINIMIZE BLIND SPOTS HEIGHT OF CAR AND BUILT UP DOOR SIDES AT RIGHT SIDE REAR WHEEL AREA MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE LOW RIDING CARS LIKE CORVETTES WHICH ARE DRIV
I HAVE SURPRISINGLY ENJOYED THE BACK UP CAMERA FEATURE WHICH COMES IN HANDY WHEN PARALLEL PARKING INTO TIGHT SPOTS
IF I COULD CHANGE ANYTHING I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE CENTER REAR VIEW MIRROR BE PLACED HIGHER ON THE WINDSHIELD SO THAT YOU CAN SEE WITHOUT OBSTRUCTION OUT THE FRONT FOR TALLER PEOPLE THE MIRROR LOCATION TENDS TO BLOCK YOUR LINE OF SIGHT AND REA
VISIBILITY IS DISTORTED BECAUSE OF THE UPPER WINDOW BEING TINTED AND LOWER WINDOW NOT IN HATCHBACK PLUS THE CAMERA IS STILL A PROBLEM WITH THE ROUNDNESS OF THE VIEW AND THE DRIVING RAIN
DRIVER SIDE MIRROR CREATES A BLIND SPOT WHEN TURNING LEFT
VERY BAD BLIND SPOTS
I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH HOW SAFE I FEEL IN MY CAR I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR
WISH THE BACK WINDOW WASN T DIVIDED LOWERS VISIBILITY SUBSTANTIALLY AND MAKES THE CAR MORE DIFFICULT TO CLEAN IN A CAR WASH THE BACK STAYS DRY AND DIRTY
POOR VISIBILITY WHEN LANE CHANGING AND TO REAR OF VEHICLE LIED TO CONCERNING BLIND SPOT DETECTION LANE CHANGE AND VEHICLE AVOIDANCE PARKING ASSIST POOR OWN FAULT AS THOUGHT THESE WERE STANDARD AND THERE WERE SO MANY OPTIONS THAT I DIDN T CHECK
REAR CAMERA DOES NOT HAVE OUTLINE LIKE COROLLA THE COROLLA OUTLINE WHEN BACKING UP IS MUCH BETTER
FRONT AND SIDE CAMERAS WOULD BE NICE THERE IS A TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES IT IS BETTER IN THE NEWER MODEL BUT STILL THERE
I WISH THE BLIND SPOTS WERE SMALLER
BACKUP CAMERA AS STANDARD EQUIPEMENT IS GREAT BECAUSE OF SPLIT REAR WINDOW
THIS IS THE ONE COMPLAINT I HAVE WITH MY NEW PRIUS IT SEEMS THAT THE VISIBILITY OF VEHICLES BOTH BEHIND ME AND TO THE RIGHT REAR OF ME IS FAR WORSE THAN MY PREVIOUS PRIUS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL AND I AM CONSTANTLY ADJUSTING IT TO
HARD TO SEE CARS IN BLIND SPOT
SPLIT SCREEN REAR VIEW IS STILL A PAIN
MAY BE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT LOOKING TOWARD RIGHT FRONT
GREAT ALL AROUND VISIBILITY
REAR VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT
THE NEW TREND IN REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY IN MANY MAKES OF VEHICLES ISN T GREAT ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED WITH SAY AN EARLY 2000 SUBARU FORESTER OR THE LIKE BUT YOU LEARN TO ADAPT AND YOU GAIN THE MPG I DO ACTUALLY FEEL QUITE SAFE IN MY PR
IT TAKES PRACTICE TO USE THE REARVIEW CAMERA WHEN BACKING UP AND USING THE OLD FASHIONED WAY OF JUST LOOKING WHERE YOU ARE GOING WITH YOUR OWN EYES
I AM USED TO DRIVING MY PRIUS BECAUSE I HAD MY LAST ONE FOR 5 YEARS THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
I FEEL QUITE SAFE IN THE COROLLA AFTER LOOKING AT YOU TUBE VIDEOS I FEEL THAT TOYOTA PUT A HIGH PRIORITY ON SAFETY I DROVE TRUCK BEFORE AND SAW MANY NEEDLESS FATALITIES THAT STILL HAUNT ME
ITS HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN THE MIRROR FOR THE SECOND ROW IS DOWN
REAR WIPER ONLY COVERS HALF OF WINDOW
BLIND SPOT OVER HOOD COMING UP STEEP INCLINE
YES I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT UNLIKE OTHER BRANDS OF VEHICLES THE PRIUS DOES NOT HAVE A BLIND SPOT ACCESSORY I HAVE PURCHASED TWO BUT I WOULD HAVE LIKED THIS COMPONENT TO HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ALONG WITH SIDE BLINKER LIGHTS
HEAD RESTS ON BACK SEATS GET IN THE WAY OF SEEING CLEARLY OUT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE BLIND SPOT IN THE PRIUS IS DANGEROUS
HEADREST HEIGHT IMPEDES REAR VISIBILITY SUN VISORS WOULD BE NICE WITH AN EXTENDER FOR CA SUNNY DAYS
DRIVERS OUTSIDE MIRROR HAS BLIND SPOT ONE MUST KEEP IN MIND BEFORE PASSING
VERY BAD BLIND SPOT ON THE BACK RIGHT SIDE
DON T LIKE THAT THERE IS NO EXTENSION ON THE SUN VISOR TO BLOCK OUT SUN FROM SIDE WINDOW THE HEAD REST IN THE REAR SEAT BLOCKS GOOD VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT
THE SPLIT WINDOW IN THE REAR ON THE HATCHBACK CONTRIBUTES TO THE POOR VISIBILITY TO THE REAR
BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING UP SEEMS LARGE ON THE BACK SIDES THIS IS COMPENSATED A BIT BY THE BACKUP CAMERA
THE HEADLIGHTS WOULD BE A 10 EXCEPT FOR THE CUTOFF WITH THE LED HEADLIGHTS AND THE POSSIBLE SAFETY CONCERNS THAT COULD RESULT FROM SIGNS NOT BEING ILLUMINATED BY HEADLIGHTS THAT SAID EVEN WITH THE CUTOFF THEY ARE STILL AWESOME AND I ABSOLUTELY
THINK SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SHOULD BE LARGER FLIP DOWN REAR HEAD RESTS OR SOMEHOW MAKE A CLEAR SHOT TO THE REAR VIEW WINDOW
BACK SEAT HEADRESTS REDUCE VISIBILITY AS WELL AS THE STRAP FOR THE PASSENGER SEATBELT
THE PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT WHILE DRIVING IS DISCONCERTINGLY BIG
WHEN THE SEAT IS NEAR THE REAR OF IT S ADJUSTMENT LIMIT THE DOOR COLUMN INTERFERES WITH BLIND SPOT VIEWING
I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED AND THOUGHT THE VEHICLE THE CAR TO HAVE THE WARNING SYMBOLS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS MOST QUALITY CARS DO NOW HAVE THIS FEATURE
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE
I DON T LIKE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AT NIGHT IT IS SUPPOSED TO DIM THE HEADLIGHT OF THE CAR IN BACK BUT IT DOESN T DO A GOOD JOB I WOULD RATHER HAVE A MANUAL ADJUSTMENT
ANY LACK OF VISION MAKES A LOWER SAFETY SCORE FOR VISION RELATED MANNERS
REAR CAMERA
I TEND TO LOOK OVER MY SHOULDERS WHEN I CHANGE LANES ON THE PASSENGER SIDE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT I DON T JUST RELY ON MY SIDE MIRRORS
I THINK THIS CAR S BIGGEST WEAKNESS IS ITS REAR VIEW VISIBILITY THROUGH A RATHER SMALL REAR WINDOW
BLIND SPOT INCREASED BY REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS HEAD LIGBT EXCEPTIONA
THE REAR WINDOW IS QUITE SMALL I REALLY CAN T SEE OTHER CARS WHEN CHANGING LANES SO I HAVE TO TURN ALL THE WAY AROUND AND LOOK THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT THE REAL DISTANCE OF CAR IN SIDE MIRROR AND APPEARANCE OF DISTANCE IS VERY LARGE
REAR VISIBILITY IS OBSTRUCTED BY REAR SEAR HEADRESTS
CAR HAS GREAT VISIBILITY
THE VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT IS THE ABSOLUTE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE IN A VEHICLE FOR ME THE PRIUSV VISIBILITY IS A MARKED IMPROVEMENT OVER PREVIOUS PRIUS VEHICLES WE HAVE A PRIUS AND I DO NOT LIKE DRIVING IT BECAUSE OF ITS
A BIG FACTOR IN THE DRIVING SAFETY IS THE FORWARD VISIBILITY FOR MY WIFE WHEN SHE DRIVES SINCE SHE IS ONLY 5 FEET TALL THIS AS WELL AS OUR FAVORABLE EXPERIENCE WITH OUR PRIUS FOR 10 YEARS WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN CHOOSING TO BUY A PRIUS V AFTE
THE BACKUP CAMERA DISPLAY IS HARD TO SEE WHEN IT S SUNNY
LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA
RAIN SENSING WIPERS WOULD BE NICE AND WHEN THE WIPERS ARE ON THE LIGHTS NEED TO COME ON AUTOMATICALLY CHRYSLER TOWN AND COUNTRY LIMITED DOES THIS
PERHAPS PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN ADJUSTING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SO THAT YOUR VISION IS NOT BLOCKED AT ALL AT 45 DEGREE ANGLE WHEN COMING TO A 4 WAY STOP
VERY BIG BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER S SIDE VIEW MIRROR
LARGE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS CAN OBSCURE VISIBILITY OF SOME VEHICLES USUALLY CAN LOOK AROUND THEM
I REALLY LIKE THE NEW SIDE VIEW MIRRORS WITH THE LITTLE INSERT THAT LIKES YOU SEE THE NEXT LANE OVER LITERALLY LETS ME DECLINE SIDE ANUTO AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS THOSE LITTLE SIDE MIRROR INSERTS ARE THE SINGLE MOST FEATURE I ENJOY OVER MY SIENN
HEADLIGHT SHOULD BE THE HIGH INTENSITY MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY ON WINDING ROADS IN THE DARK WITH MANY ANIMALS ROAMING
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BIG THE SIDE MIRRORS BLOCK SIGHT WHEN YOU ARE TUNING
HUGE COMPLAINT RAV4 DOES NOT HAVE WIPER FLUID FOR REAR WINDOW EXTREME ISSUE WHEN DRIVING IN THE WINTER WITH ALL THE SALT THAT GOT ON THE WINDOW AND MADE REAR VISIBILITY ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IN SOME STORMS RAV4 HAD REAR FLUID PLEASE
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT WITH REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN ENTERTAINMENT SCREEN IS DOWN IS LIMITING BECAUSE IT BLOCK YOUR VIEW IN THE MIDDLE
I CHOSE THE SEQUOIA OVER A TAHOE BECAUSE OF THE GREAT VISIBILITY I FEEL SAFER IN THIS CAR
SIDE MIRRORS COULD BE IMPROVED FOR BETTER BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY
TINTED WINDOWS HARD TO SEE OUT OF AT NIGHT
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE AN APPARENT CUTOFF IN THEIR HEIGHT NON BRIGHT SETTING MAKING IT A BIT UNNERVING DRIVING DOWN A HILL DECLINE WITH LITTLE VISIBILITY AHEAD OF ME
I WISH THAT TOYOTA WOULD GIVE AN OPTION OF ORDERING ALL THE SAFETY TECHNOLOGY WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE UP TO MORE EXPENSIVE MODELS WITH FEATURES THAT ARE NOT NEEDED I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO ORDER THE COLLUSION AND LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEMS WITHO
WITH THE VISORS SOMETIMES THEY HAD EXTENSIONS ON THE VISOR TO BLOCK OUT THE BLIND SPOT FROM THE SUN
LOVE BACKUP CAMERA
I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE A FEW BLINDSPOTS
NEEDS BETTER LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS AND ALL MODELS SHOULD HAVE DAY LIGHT RUNNING LIGHTS
CAN SEE CLEARLY LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM WHEN CHANGING LANE
I FEEL LIKE IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT THE FRONT PERIPHERALLY BECAUSE OF THAT NEW FUNKY TINY WINDOW THEY PUT IN THE FRONT THE SUPPORT FOR IT IS IN THE WAY OF LOOKING FOR CARS COMING FROM THE RIGHT I FEEL THE BLIND SPOT IS WORSE FOR THIS CAR THAN M
THE REAR VIEW CAM GETS WATER ON IT MAKING IT LESS USEFUL WHEN IT IS RAINING ONLY LIGHTLY
SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE BACK WINDOW CAN BE A LITTLE SMALL WHILE LOOKING OUT CENTER MIRROR LOOKING OVER SHOULDER SOMETIMES SEEMS A LITTLE STRAINED TO SEE IF CAR IN BLIND SPOT
FOR A VEHICLE IN TO NOT HAVE HID HEADLIGHTS I THINK IS A SHAME
BIG BLIND SPOT WHEN SWITCHING LANES EASILY OVERCOME BY BLIND SPOT SENSOR
REALLY LIKE THE ABILITY TO SEE THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE AND CARS BEHIND OUR SIENNA WHILE DRIVING ALSO LIKE THE SMALL MIRRORS ATTACHED TO THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS TO HELP COVER THE BLIND SPOTS
FEEL LIKE SMALL REAR WINDOWS MAKE BLIND SPOTS
THERE ARE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES AND BACKING WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD TO ENSURE YOU HAVEN T MISSED ANYTHING WITH THE MIRROR
FRONT RIGHT AND LEFT BLIND SPOTS BETWEEN SIDE MIRRORS AND ROOF SUPPORTS
BLIND SPOT DUE TO PASSENGER SIDE WINDSHIELD POST SEEMS TO BE COMMON DRIVER MUST ADJUSTMENT AND GET ACCUSTOMED TO THAT IN PICK UP I ADD THE SMALL MIRRORS ON BOTH MIRRORS FOR BETTER VISIBILITY WHILE CHANGING LANES
THE BACK WINDOW IS SMALLER AND CREATES DANGEROUS BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
OFFER HID HEADLIGHTS AS A STANDARD OR AN OPTION MY OTHER CARS ARE PORSCHE AND BMW AND I VE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO HID HEADLIGHTS
MY BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BIG COMPARED TO WHAT I AM USED TO ALTHOUGH I HAVE ALWAYS DRIVEN SMALLER CARS SO THAT MAY JUST COME WITH THE TERRITORY OF GOING BIGGER
BLIND SPOT IS PRETTY BAD STILL REAR HEADRESTS DO OBSCURE 10 15% OF THE REAR VISIBILITY
MANY BLIND SPOTS FROM SEATS AND DOOR POSTS
CAMPER MIRRORS NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIGGER TO HAVE A BIGGER LOWER MIRROR FOR BETTER VISIBILITY OF LANES AND BLIND SPOTS
STYLING OF ALL WINDOWS PLACES THE BAR BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR WINDOW IN MY SIGHTLINE WHEN LOOKING TO SIDE TO CHANGE LANES REAR ADJUSTED WELL BUT WHEN DOUBLE CHECKING BY TURN HEAD OR USING REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT SEPARATION BAR BETWEEN WINDOWS
TO MANY BLIND SPOTS  NO BLIND SPOT MIRRORS OR SIDE AVOIDANCE TURN SIGNALS IN THE MIRRORS WOULD BE NICE
BIG BLIND SPOTS MAKE LANE CHANGE INDICATORS STANDARD
REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT GOOD BECAUSE OF THE 3RD SET HEADRESTS
LARGER THAN USUAL BLINDSPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
SAFETY IS IMPORTANT MY WIFE EVEN LIKES TO DRIVE IT
I PUT ONE IN MYSELF BUT IT COULD USE A BIGGER REAR VIEW MIRROR YOU CAN SEE ALOT MORE WITH A BIGGER MIRROR BLIND SPOTS AND ALL
IT IS HARD TO BACK THE TRUCK THE REAR CAMERA SCREEN IS HARD TO SEE IN BRIGHT DAYLIGHT
VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD
I LIKE HAVING SENSORS IN THE SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS THAT TELL WHEN YOU ARE TO CLOSE TO ANOTHER CAR OR IN YOUR BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY COULD USE SOME IMPROVEMENTS
U COULD USE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
MAYBE COULD SIT A LITTLE HIGHER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY SINCE ITS A CROSSOVER
CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT REVEALS A BLIND SPOT IN THE RIGHT REAR CORNER OF THE CAR
I WAS GOING TO BUY A PRIUS BUT THE VISIBILITY WHEN IT RAINED WAS AWFUL SO I WENT WITH THE VENZA AND THE VISIBILITY IS AWESOME FOR ME
OUTSIDE DOOR MIRRORS AND A PILLARS CREATE BLIND SPOTS CAUSES ISSUES WHEN NAVIGATING PARKING LOTS OR TIGHT SITUATIONS MIRRORS AND A PILLARS CAN COMPLETELY HIDE SMALL VEHICLES AND CURBS
REAR SIDE VISIBILITY IS BLOCKED BY HEAD RESTS AND THE BLOCKED SPACE BEHIND REAR DOOR WINDOWS
I WISH THE REAR VIEW CAMERA HAD A SWITCH THAT WOULD ENABLE ME TO SEE BEHIND ME WHILE TRAVELING FORWARD IT WORKS ONLY WHEN TRANSMISSION IS IN REVERSE IF I WERE PULLING SOMETHING SUCH AS BOAT OR CAMPER I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CHECK ON HITCH AND
IT CAN BE HARD TO SEE IN THE BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDES OF THE CAR
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE BAD THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE ESSENTIAL TO MAKE ANE CHANGES SAFELY
SIGNIFICANT BLINDSPOT BUT IT JUST FORCES YOU TO BE A BETTER MORE VIGILANT DRIVER THAT S NOT A BAD THING
HAS A HUGE BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT AND LEFT SIDE DIFFICULTY SEEINF THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE VEHICLE NEEDS TURN SIGNALS THAT ARE VISIBLE FROM THE SIDE THE SIDE MARKERS DO NOT FLASH AND ONLY FUNCTION AS PARKING LIGHTS THE FR S NEEDS THE TURN SIGNALS ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS OR FLASHING SIDE MARKERS
ANOTHER REASON I PURCHASED THIS CAR VISABILITY WAS BETTER THAN MY TUCSON
I WISH THERE WAS A BACKUP CAMERA INSTALLED FROM FACTORY
I WISH THE HEADLIGHTS WERE XENON LEDS FOR LOOKS FUNCTION AND SAFETY
WOULD ONE TO HAVE A REARVIEW CAMERA AND LANE CHANGE WARNING
THERE ARE LARGE BLIND SPOTS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES WHEN LOOKING TO CHANGE LANES THE STANCHION LEADING FROM THE ROOF TO THE TRUNK IS VERY LARGE AND MAKES CHECKING THE BLIND SPOT DIFFICULT
THE HEADLIGHT ADJUSTMENT FROM THE DASH IS GREAT ON DARK OR FOGGY ROADS WHEN HIGH BEAMS ARE TOO BRIGHT
SUN VISORS DO NOT BLOCK SUNLIGHT VERY WELL SUN VISOR EXTENDERS NOT AVAILABLE IN THIS VEHICLE WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE
I THINK I HAD BETTER SIDE MIRROR VISIBILITY IN MY 09 VENZA
REAR VIEW VISIBILITY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED WITH LARGER GLASS
CAR NEEDS ELECTRONIC BLIND SPOT MONITOR UNFORTUNATELY THIS OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE VENZA MODEL
I AM AMAZED THAT TOYOTA IS NOT OFFERING LED OR AT LEAST HID HEADLIGHTS ON THIS VEHICLE
I FEEL SAFE IN MY VEHICLE HOWEVER HAVE TO REALLY CHECK BLIND SPOT BECAUSE THERE ISN T A SENSOR MECHANISM ALERT FOR THIS CONSIDERING THERE S A FAIR BLIND SPOT
REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY IS NOT PARTICULARLY GOOD BUT THAT IS OFFSET BY THE REAR VIEW CAMERA WHICH WORKS VERY WELL
LOVE HEAD LIGHTS WIDE RANGE OVER THE ROAD TO EACH SIDE OF THE ROAD WHICH MAKE GREAT VISIBILITY AT NIGHT
AVAILABILITY OF A REAR VIEW CAMERA ENABLING YOU TO LOOK AT TRAFFIC BEHIND YOUR CAR WHILE DRIVING THE BACKUP CAMERA WOULD DO FINE FOR THIS PURPOSE HONDA HAS AN EXCELLENT SYSTEM WITH CAMERA IN PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR IT ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO SEE OVER
PLEASE ADD A BREATHALYZER FOR THE ADDICTS BLOOD GLUCOSE DEVICE FOR THE TYPE II DIABETICS AND INSTALL A DEVICE THAT MEASURES DRUGS IN YOUR SYSTEM BEFORE THE CAR WILL START THEN YOU CAN DELETE THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEM AND ALL THE OTHER
LOVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AND THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR
GOOD WINDSHIELD VISIBILITY
DO NOT KNOW ABOUT VISIBILITY FROM REAR SEAT AS I HAVE NEVER RIDDEN IN THE REAR
HEAD RESTS RESTRICT VISIBILITY
I VE NOTICED THAT WHEN THE RADAR IS ACTIVE ON CRUISE CONTROL THAT IT WILL SLOW THE VEHICLE DOWN TO A CERTAIN POINT AND THEN KICK OFF WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE VEHICLE CAPABLE OF COMING TO A COMPLETE STOP IN A SITUATION ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE R
BACK UP AND BLIND SIDE ARE WONDERFUL AND SHOULD BE MANDATORY IN ALL VEHICLES
ONCE AGAIN VISIBILITY ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED
I ALWAYS LINE TO SEE THE LEFT FRONT FENDER WHEN DRIVING AND PARKING I CANNOT IN THIS CAR
WISH IT HAD FRONT COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM   ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
BACKUP CAMERA IS VERY EFFECTIVE AND USEFUL
VISIBILITY OUT OF THE SIDES IN THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE IS VERY POOR THE WINDOWS ARE VERY SMALL AND CREATE QUITE THE BLINDSPOT ON THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE
THERE IS NO BLIND SPOT IN THE VEHICLE FOR ME VERY IMPORTANT THE VISIBILITY IS EXCEPTIONAL
SIDE VISION WHEN IN TRAFFIC IS INSUFFICIENT WHEN NEARBY VEHICLES ARE IN A BLIND SPOT NOT VISIBLE WHEN DIRECTLY OPPOSITE OR WITHIN A VEHICLE LENGTH OF MY VEHICLE ON EITHER SIDE
ALL CARS HAVE BLIND SPOTS THE CAMRY IS PRETTY GOOD ABOUT ITS BLIND SPOTS THE CAR FEELS VERY STURDY SAFE AND WELL BUILT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE PLACEMENT AND DESIGN OF THE SIDE MIRRORS I DONT LIKE THEM I KNOW THEY HAVE TO BE STYLISH AND AL
I EXPECTED THIS CAR TO COME WITH WARNING LIGHTS WHEN CHANGING LANES OR CHANGING LANES WITH ANOTHER CAR TOO CLOSE
DASHBOARD SEEMS TO TAKE UP A LOT OF VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING OUT THE FRONT WINDSHIELD
NO ALL IN SAFETY IS GOOD
Z REAR WIPER NEEDED
BEING A TALLER DRIVER AT 6 4 I FEEL THAT MY VISIBILITY IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST THE FRONT PILLARS OCCASIONALLY OBSCURE MY VIEW WHEN TURNING
LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA AND WARNING DEVICE
1 THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT IS NOT ANY WORSE THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR WHICH DID NOT HAVE A BACK UP CAMERA WHICH IS NORMAL NOWADAYS IT SEEMS HOWEVER IT IS AN AREA THAT I WISH ALL VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS WOULD TRY TO IMPROVE 2 I W
LANE CHANGES THE WINDOW BACK PASSENGER WIDOWS ARE HARD TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT
MIRROR HAS A BLIND SPOT WHEN YOU ARE CHANGING LANES THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT CORNER ON OUR JETTA WE COULD SLIDE THE VISOR TO BLOCK THE SUN AND ON OUR JETTA WE CAN T DO THIS AND IT CAUSES A HAZARD
USING SIDE MIRRORS WHEN CHANGING LANES HAS EXCELLENT VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING YOUR HEAD TO SEE OUT PASSENGER SIDE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT OUTSIDE BEHIND REAR PASSENGER SEAT SIDE
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THE POSITION OF THE HEADRESTS IN THE BACK CAUSE SOME BLIND SPOTS IN THE BACK
VERY POOR VISIBILITY THROUGH REAR WINDOW
THE SHAPE OF SIDE MIRRORS RESTRICT THE VISIBILITY
WASN T SURE I D USE THE BACK UP CAMERA BUT I LIKE IT ESPECIALLY HELPFUL SINCE VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS LIMITED
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS PLACED AT A VERY ODD SPOT IN THE WINDSHIELD IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE AT ALLOWING THE DRIVER TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW THIS LEAVES A 5 6 INCH OR MORE GAP BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD AND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR ON
THE MOLDING BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOORS CREATE A SEVERE BLIND SPOT
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING SWITCHING LANES AND OVERALL WHILE DRIVING ON THE CRAZY FREEWAYS IN LOS ANGLES
GOOD VISIBILITY NO SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS
B AND C PILLARS ARE HUGE FEEL LIKE THERE ARE HUGE BLIND SPOTS ON YOUR SIDES PARTICULARLY IF YOU RE LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER TO CHECK MIRRORS HELP AND CLEAR SOME OF IT UP BUT I FEEL WORRIED WHEN CHANGING LANES OR BACKING OUT OF A PARKING S
THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS ARE QUITE SMALL BUT STILL USABLE WHILE THE A AND B PILLARS ARE SMALLER THAN COMPETITORS C PILLARS ARE STILL LARGE THE SUN VISORS ARE CLEVER BUT TOO SMALL ON LONGER TRIPS THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS AREN T PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE
HAVE BI XENON AND ADAPTIVE LIGHTS
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE WAY TOO SMALL THE BLIND SPOT IS JUST HUGE WHEN BACKING UP AND I TURN TO LOOK BACK TOWARD THE REAR OF THE PASSENGER SIDE I FIND IT VERY HARD TO REALLY SEE MUCH OUTSIDE THE CAR ON THE OTHER HAND VISIBILITY FORWARD WHILE DRI
REAR VISIBILITY THROUGH BACK WINDOW IS DIFFICULT BUT THE INCLUDED REAR VIEW CAMERA MAKES BACKING UP MUCH EASIER
IT GIVES ME GREAT VISIBILITY VIA THE MIRRORS AND LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDERS
WIPER BLADES COULD BE BOSCH WOULD BE BETTER
I DID NOT PURCHASE THE LIGHTING PACKAGE WITH MY GTI THE HEADLIGHTS ARE STILL EFFECTIVE BUT I FIND THAT VISIBILITY OF THE HALOGEN HEADLIGHTS IN MY OLDER JETTA APPEARS BETTER THEN THEM
IT COULD BE THE POINTED SHAPE OF SIDE MIRRORS THAT IS CAUSING THE VISABILITY PROBLEM I ALSO HAVE A JUDGMENT ISSUE WHEN PULLING OVER TO A CURB I THINK I AM RIGHT NEAR THE CURB AND I CAN BE 2 FEET AWAY I AM ONLY 4 11 BUT I DID HAVE A VW RABBIT
SIDE MIRRORS ARE A LITTLE ON THE SMALL SIDE MAKING SIDE VISIBILITY A LITTLE DIFFICULT
VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING UP AND CHANGING LANES IS NOT GREAT
GREAT VISIBILITY ALL AROUND OF THE CAR
THE STOCK WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES HAVE GOTTEN A TEAR ON THEM IN THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS THAT IVE HAD THE VEHICLE
THERE IS A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE   REAR WHICH ADDS SOME RISK TO LANE CHANGES TO MOVING TO THE LEFT
THE GOLF HAS A NASTY DRIVERS BLIND SPOT THIS IS COMPLICATED BY LARGE REAR HEADRESTS I WOULD LIKE TO REMOVE MINE AS I RARELY HAVE REAR PASSENGERS
VERY BAD BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE YOU BETTER TURN YOUR HEAD WHEN CHANGING LANES BECAUSE THERE MAYBE A VEHICLE RIGHT NEXT TO YOU THAT IS NOT PICKED UP IN YOUR LEFT OUTSIDE MIRROR MIRROR IS ADJUSTED CORRECTLY
BAD VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING OVER LEFT SHOULDER TO REAR
THE VISIBILITY IS AVERAGE BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT SAFER IN A CAR IT FEELS SAFE EVEN IN SNOW
SURE MISS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM I HAD ON MY MAZDA3 CAN T UNDERSTAND WHY VW DOES NOT OFFER
WHEN THE WINDSHIELD WIPER PULLS AWAY FROM THE FAR LEFT POSITION ON THE DRIVER S SIDE IT PULLS A BIT OF WATER BACK WITH IT AND SLIGHTLY OBSTRUCTS VISION NOT A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR ME ONLY WHEN IT IS RAINING STEADY
I FEEL THAT THE SAFETY OPTIONS PRESENT BY MY CAR ENSURES MY WELL BEING
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL FOR GOOD VISIBILITY
WHILE VISIBILITY TO THE SIDES AND REAR IS GOOD THE BELT WINDOW LINE SEEMS HIGHER MAKING IT FEEL LIKE THERE IS LESS VISIBILITY THE BLACK HEADLINER AND DARK ENVIRONMENT IT CREATES WITH THE BLACK PLAID INTERIOR ALSO MAKES IT FEEL LIKE THERE IS LESS
DURING MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN THE DRIVER S WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADE SUCKS BACK WATER FROM THE A PILLAR DUE TO AERODYNAMIC FACTORS THIS OBSCURES PART OF THE DRIVER S FIELD OF VIEW
VISIBILITY WHILE LOOKING OVER LEFT SHOULDER IS HINDERED BY THE DOOR FRAME BUT I AM AWARE THE DOOR FRAME IS THERE FOR MY SAFETY
DIFFICULT TO SEE CLEARLY THROUGH THE PASSENGER SEAT HEAD REST AND DOOR FRAME TO YOUR RIGHT WHILE BACKING BLIND SPOT
I LIKE THE BACKUP CAMERA
THE VW CC I HAD BEFORE THIS HAD BETTER HEADLIGHTS ALONG WITH THE TURNING LIGHTS THAT MADE THE VISIBILITY AT NIGHT SO MUCH BETTER
WISH IT WOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT SIDE MIRROR WARNING AND LANE CHANGE WARNING
I LIKE THE TURNING LIGHTS THAT AUTO TURNS ON MY FOG LAMPS TO ADD EXTRA VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT IN DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER TO DOUBLE CHECK FOR CARS MOTORCYCLES
I M TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO BE ABLE TO SEE CARS BEHIND ME WHEN I TURN MY HEAD TO TO THE LEFT I HAVE TO RELY THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
I WISHED THE TIGUAN HAD SIDE BLIND SPOT WARNING FOR THE MOST PART VW PUTS SAFETY WHERE IT IS MOST NEEDED
HAD A PROBLEM SEEING A SMALL CAR IN MY BLIND SPOT BUT NOW I CHECK THAT SPOT MANUALLY BEFORE I TURN
I WISH IT HAD MORE SAFETY FEATURES LIKE THE LIGHT WARNING IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR WHEN A CAR IS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT
HAS SOME BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY PASSENGER FRONT SEAT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE WHERE ITS AT TO SEE OUT TO OTHER LANES FRON BACK PASSENGER WINDOW
BI ZENON HEADLIGHTS
BLIND SPOT SEEMS TO BE LARGE IN THIS CAR FOR SOME REASON
THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT ON THIS VEHICLE EVEN WITH THE SIDE MIRRORS ADJUSTED OUT QUITE FAR I CAN STILL CANNOT SEE FOR EXAMPLE A FULL SIZE PICK UP WHEN IT IS IN THE BLIND SPOT
DOOR REAR VIEW MIRRORS A TAD SMALL
XENON HEADLIGHTS STANDARD WOULD BE IDEAL MY PREVIOUS ACURA TSX CAME WITH THAT FEATURE STANDARD ON A $27 000 CAR AT $42 000 FOR MY S60 THIS SHOULD BE INCLUDED
THERE ARE 2 BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
HAVING A HARD TIME PARALLEL PARKING CAN T REALLY TELL WHERE MY FRONT AND BACK BUMPERS ARE JUST DON T HAVE THE FEEL OF THE CAR YET I GUESS
I HAVE TWO YOUNG CHILDREN AND VISIBILITY AND SAFETY WERE IMPORTANT FACTOR IN PURCHASE DECISION
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT ALERT AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL I FEEL SAFER BECAUSE THE ELECTRONIC SAFETY FEATURES
I LOVE THAT THIS MODEL IS NOT HAS HEAVY SUCH AS THE TRUNK AND DOORS I LIKE THAT I HAVE MUCH FEWER BLIND SPOTS THAN BEFORE
VISIBILITY NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED WHILE CHANGING LANES
THE VEHICLE SEEMS TO HAVE FAIRLY LARGE BLIND SPOTS ALTHOUGH THE BLIS SYSTEM IS VERY HELPFUL
I WISH MY CAR HAD HID LIGHTS
WIFE LIKED THE TIGUAN BECAUSE OF IT S GREAT VISIBILITY
LARGE BLINDSPOT ON SIDE MIRRORS
HAD TO GET USED TO SEEING THE CONTROL BOX WHERE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS IT EFFECTS VISABILITY BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE AND COLOR
DIMMED MIRRORS ARE HORRIBLE FOR BACKING UP IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY THAT THIS VEHICLE HAS A BACK UP CAMERA ESPECIALLY WITH THE CONCAVE BACK WAS TOLD I COULD HAVE A BACK UP CAMERA INSTALLED ENDED UP NOT BEING TRUE SO I SETTLED FOR BACK UP SENSORS
GREAT VISIBILITY FROM THE VEHICLE
I TRUSTED THE BACKUP SAFETY SYSTEM TO WARN ME OF OBJECTS BEHIND ME AND I BACKED INTO A TRUNK NEVER TRUST THE BACKUP SAFETY SYSTEM ALONE
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IT S A GREAT TOOL TO HAVE IN THE CAR
I THINK IT WOULD BE HARD TO BACKUP WITHOUT REAR CAMERA
THE VISIBILITY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO US AND DISCOUNTED MANY VEHICLES WE TESTED THE XC60 HAS EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY FOR THE DRIVER
ADAPTIVE HEADLIGHT SYSTEM IS FANTASTIC WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT
TINTED REAR WINDOW DIMINISHES VISIBILITY OF CARS BEHIND
I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED VOLVOS FOR THE SAFETY AND OUT WARD VISIBILTY MY 1992 VOLVO 240 HAS OVER 350000 MILES STILL GOING WELL IN THE HANDS OF MY TEENAGER NOW
VISIBILITY COULD BE HELPED WITH SMALL MAGNIFIED ADDITION TO REAR VIEW MIRRORS
REAR VISIBILITY IS A BIT OBSCURED BY THE UTTERLY BEAUTIFULLY COUPE Y STYLING BUT OKAY TRADEOFF BLIS AND BACKUP CAMERA HELPS THIS TREMENDOUSLY
LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA IT S NOT PERFECT BUT IT S BEEN VERY HELPFUL SO FAR
I PREFER ZENON HEAD LAMPS
BLIND SPOT INDICATOR IS A GREAT SAFETY FEATURE
VOLVO HAS ALWAYS HAD BLIND SPOT ISSUES AND THIS CAR IS NO EXCEPTION IT IS MITIGATED A GREAT DEAL WITH THE BLIS
I LOVE THE LANE CHANGE WARNING ALSO THE BRAKING SYSTEM WHEN CRUISE IS TURNED ON THE OVER ALL FEELING OF SAFETY IS ALSO TREMENDOUS
I AM TRULY DISAPPOINTED IN THE BLINDSPOT FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT AND RIGHT SIDE OF VEHICLE
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS WE PURCHASED THE CAR WAS FOR THE SAFETY FEATURES AND SAFETY RATING I ALWAYS FEEL SAFE IN IT WE HAD A XC60 AND WERE IN A SERIOUS ACCIDENT WITH LITTLE PHYSICAL HARM TO OURSELVES WHICH IS WHY WE PURCHASED ANOTHER XC
REAR WING IMPAIRS REAR VISIBILITY FROM CENTER MIRROR SHOULD CONSIDER A REAR VISION CAMERA
EXTREMELY LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY WITHOUT THE REAR CAMERA AND LANE CHANGE CAPABILITIES
IT IS EXPECTED GIVEN THE VEHICLE FORMAT BUT THE REAR WINDOW IS USELESS CAMERA AND SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE WHAT HAVE TO BE USED TO BACK IT UP
IT S A CONVERTIBLE SO VISIBILITY IS GREAT WHEN THE TOP IS DOWN
REAR WINDOW WIPER IS STUPID AND DANGEROUS DOES NOT SWIPE THE ENTIRE GLASS BUILT FOR ONLY THREE FOURTHS OF WINDOW AGAINST NO THOUGHTS IN THIS AREA
HARD TO SEE OUT OF REAR WINDOW BECAUSE OF BAR ACROSS LOWER PORTION OF WINDOW AT LEAST HAVING BACKUP CAMERA HELPS WITH THIS ISSUE
I WISH THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR HAD THE SAME FEATURES AS THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR CAMERA FEATURE
I WISH THERE WAS BETTER VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW THE DIVIDED WINDOW TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO AND A LOT OF TIMES WHEN CARS ARE A SAFE DISTANCE BEHIND YOU CAN T EVEN SEE THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE TOTALLY OBSCURED BY THE DIVIDE IN THE WINDOWS
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CAMERA ON BOTH EXTERIOR MIRRORS
THE SIDE PILLARS CAN CAUSE A BLIND SPOT AT STOP SIGNS
I WISH THEY DESIGNED THE SUN SHADES TO PROTECT FROM EARLY AM SUN LIGHT COMING IN BETWEEN THE PASSENGER SIDE SUN SHADE AND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
FOR PARKING CAN T SEE FRONT NOSE OF CAR WOULD LIKE A FRONT PARKING CAMERA
WHEN PULLING ONTO A CROSS STREET VISIBILITY IS BLOCKED BY THE PANEL BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK BLOCKING THE DRIVERS VIEW
REAR VISIBILITY WITHOUT CAMARA COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER
WISH VISIBILITY WAS A BIT BETTER MORE LIKE THE XC60 VISIBILITY
STILL ADJUSTING FROM THE VERY GOOD VISIBILITY OF MY 2004 V70 LEARNING TO DEPEND ON REAR CAMERA AND WILL ADJUST IN TIME
EXCEPTIONAL COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM WITH HEADS UP DISPLAY
LOVE THE REAR SPOILER BUT IT BLOCKS VISIBILITY
STYLING WHILE ATTRACTIVE DOES AFFECT VISIBILITY
THE VEHICLE IS HEAVY AND I DO FEEL SAFE IN IT THE DOOR CLOSES AND SOUNDS VERY SECURE I DO EXPERIENCE BLIND SPOTS WHEN I LOOK TO THE SIDE WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES OR TURN I SEE THE SIDE MIRROR ON MY LEFT AND IT DOES BLOCK QUITE A LOT OF MY
ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE THIS CAR OVER OTHER CONVERTIBLES IS THE REAR VISIBILITY WAS EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR FIELD OF VISION SEEMS TOO SMALL
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS THE DRIVER S SIGHT TO THE RIGHT
DRIVER SHOULD HAVE A BLIND SPOT MIRROR AS PART OF THE SIDE MIRRORS
I PURCHASED THE OPTION WITH A SAFETY SYSTEM THAT MUST BE MANUALLY TURNED ON EVERY TIME AND THIS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO STAY ON IF I LEAVE IT ON
LOW SPEED COLLISION WARNING A LITTLE TOO SENSITIVE GOES OFF IN DRIVE THRU LINE
MANY BLIND SPOTS TO OVERCOME
EXCEPTIONAL FEELING OF SAFETY FEATURES OF THIS CAR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES CHANCE OF ACCIDENT
SIDE VIEW FROM THE BACK WINDOWS IS LIMITED DUE TO VERY SMALL TRIANGULAR GLASS OPENING AT THE REAR END IT SHOULD BE LARGER AND LOWER SO THE VEHICLE COMING FROM BEHIND IN THE SIDE LANE IS VISIBLE EARLY
BLIND SPOT WARNING INDICATOR WELL PLACED
DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR COULD USE A BLIND SPOT FEATURE
NEEDS A REVIEW CAMERA
I LIKE THE 360 CAMERA
I APPRECIATE ALL THE SAFETY FEATURES
I LOVE THE FORWARD VISIBILITY SITTING UP HIGH FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES THE VISIBILITY FROM THE REAR SEATS SHE IS TWO YEARS OLD AND NOW COMMENTS ABOUT ALL THE THINGS SHE SEES OUT HER WINDOW I HAVE ALSO HAD ADULT PASSENGERS
WOULD HAVE ORDERED NEW TECHNOLOGIES REGARDING LANE CHANGING ETC IF THE PACKAGE DID NOT ALSO DEMAND THAT I HAVE LARGER WHEELS THAT MAKE THE RIDE ROUGHER INFINITI PACKAGING OPTIONS ARE AWFUL AND MY GUESS IS THAT THESE SAFETY FEATURES EVENTUALL
DIFFICULT TO HAVE PERFECT REAR VIEW VISIBILITY WHEN 3RD SEATS ARE UP
SAFETY FEATURES ARE EXCELLENT AND I HAVE ENCOUNTERED NO PROBLEMS REGARDING VISIBILITY IN ANY DRIVING CONDITION
AMAZING VISIBILITY JUST ABOUT FULL 360 DEGREE VIEW
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN OPTION BUY THE CAR WITH REAR CAMERA I M READY TO PAY ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR IT ALL MY OTHER CARS HAVE BACK UP CAMERAS
THE ONLY ISSUE I WOULD POINT OUT IS THE BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING OUT THE BACK WINDOW FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT THE REAR PILLARS BLOCK A GOOD PORTION MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT WHEN BACKING UP AND SWITCHING LANES
BLIND SPOTS ARE DIFFICULT TO SEE SOMETIMES AND REARVIEW MIRROR IS A BIT SMALL MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE LARGE ANGLES OF THE REAR
IT DOES HAVE A BLIND SPOT THERE IS A BLOCK ON THE INSIDE OF THE CAR CLOSE TO THE SIDE MIRROR THAT PREVENTS YOU FROM SEEING HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WHEN TURNING CORNERS THIS TENDS TO MAKE YOU WANT TO TAKE THE CORNER TOO WIDE
HEADLIGHT HIGH BEAMS ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY SHOULD BE
BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDE
THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS A PLUS HOWEVER VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES CAN BE A PROBLEM
HUGE BLIND SPOT TO RIGHT REAR BUT I ADDED BLIND SPOT MIRRORS TO COMPENSATE
EVEN THOUGH IT IS AN IMPROVEMENT IN VISIBILITY WITH THE BACK WINDOW FROM THE TO THE CAN STILL BE DIFFICULT TO SEE IN BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING OUT NO BACK UP CAMERA IF THE BACK WINDOW COULD BE WIDENED IF COULD IMPROVE VISIBILITY
THE REAR VIEW CENTER MIRROR COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER THE SMALL REAR VIEW CENTER MIRROR IS A BIT SMALL TO WHAT I M USED TO THE SUN SHADE COULD USE A BUILT IN EXTENDERS FOR SUNSHADES
THIS IS MY 4TH BEETLE AND I ENJOY DRIVING IT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD AND OTHER VEHICLES THAT THE CAR PROVIDES IT IS EASY TO DRIVE AND I FEEL SAFE IN THE CAR
VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS NOT AS GOOD AS IN A LARGER VEHICLE BUT YOU JUST HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
LARGE BLIND SPOT WHEN REVERSING
VISIBILITY OF THE RIGHT REAR VERY POOR
I WOULD LIKE A REAR WINDOW WIPER AND WASHER JET IDEALLY
I WISH I HAD BLIND SPOT WARNING
THE CAR HAS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT TOWARDS THE BACK
THE SUNVISORS ARE TOO SHORT AND NOT WIDE DEEP ENOUGH FOR DRIVERS PASSENGERS OF AVERAGE HEIGHT I HAVE THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS SET TO COVER THE BLIND SPOTS AS OPPOSED TO LEAVING THEM IN THE STANDARD POSITION THIS WORKS GREAT BUT DOES REQUIRE RE
WOULD BE GOOD IF THERE ARE OPTIONS FOR MORE SAFETY FEATURES
I DID ADD LITTLE ROUND MIRRORS ON MY SIDE MIRRORS AS THERE IS A SOME BLIND SPOT
THERE IS LESS VISIBILITY IN THIS MODEL THAN MY 2003 MODEL THERE IS MORE OF A BLIND SPOT
THE BLIND SPOTS OUT THE REAR AND RIGHT SIDE ARE MORE THAN I HAVE EXPERIENCED WITH ANY OTHER CAR I THINK BACK UP SENSORS SHOULD BE STANDARD IN A CAR I REALLY MISS THEM FROM MY LAST CAR
SEE PREVIOUS COMMENT REGARDING READ HEAD RESTS AND REAR VIEW MIRROR
BAD BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP
REAR VISIBITY IS HAMPERED BY THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS
THE REAR WINDOW HAS EXTREMELY LIMITED RANGE OF VISION A CAMERA WHEN BACKING IS NEEDED
GREATER ADJUSTABILITY IN THE SUN VISORS REAR CAMERA REMOTE ENGINE START MORE VISIBILITY IN GENERAL
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO BUT IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS HOWEVER I FEEL THAT SOME PEOPLE MAY RELY TO HEAVILY ON IT AND THE DEPTH PERCEPTION OF THE CAMERA S VIEW ISN T THE GREATEST
WISH THE BACK UP CAMERA SHOWED MORE OF THE ACTUAL DISTANCE YOU ARE FROM THE OBJECTS
ABILITY OF SIDE VIEW MIRRORS TO ELIMINATE BLIND SPOTS IS EXCELLENT
REAR VISIBILITY IS COMPROMISED VIA SPOILER AN ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE DUE TO DOWNFORCE ABILITY
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR IN ORDER TO BACK UP I AM CONSTANTLY CHECKING BETWEEN THE REAR CAMERA AND BACK WINDOW
BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT I DID NOT OPT TO PAY FOR OPTION OF LANE CHANGE WARNING TECHNOLOGY
VISIBILITY IS GREAT
REAR VISIBILITY IS VERY LIMITED BY THE SIZE OF THE WINDOW
REAR VISIBILITY GREAT WHEN TOP IS DOWN POOR WHEN UP
THE REAR CAMERA IS ONE OF THE BEST I VE SEEN IN A SUV   CUV MAKES REVERSING AN EASE
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOISY
HEADLIGHT LEVEL ADJUSTMENT LIGHT HAS COME ON SEVERAL TIMES INDICATING NEED FOR SERVICE
THE REAR PILLARS MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS PRESENT OR APPROACHING IN THE BLIND SPOTS I DON T THINK A LARGER REVIEW MIRROR WOULD HELP THE REAR WINDOWS NEED TO BE LARGE TO AFFORD DRIVERS A BETTER VIEW
I WISH THE MIRRORS AND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WERE BIGGER
NEEDS A BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
I M ACCUSTOMED TO SETTING SIDE MIRRORS SO THERE IS NO BLIND SPOT I THINK THIS CAR WILL HAVE ON WHETHER I LIKE IT OR NOT
BACKUP CAMERA WITH DYNAMIC LINES AND FRONT AND REAR PARKING SENSORS A VERY USEFUL FEATURE
REAR VISIBILTY BELOW AVERAGE ITS ALL OK OR BETTER
I FIND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR DOES NOT GIVE A FULL VIEW OUT THE BACK WINDOW BECAUSE OF THE HEAD REST ON THE 2ND ROW S MIDDLE SEAT I MUST DOUBLE CHECK OTHER VIEWING OPTIONS TO GIVE ME COMFORT IN MY VISIBILITY
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR APPEARS TO BE MOUNTED UPSIDE DOWN
I LIKE THE HID HEADLIGHT WHICH PRODUCES NICE BRIGHT LIGHT FOR NIGHT TIME DRIVING DAYTIME DRIVING LIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN LED S INSTEAD OF THE AMBERISH COLOR LIGHTING LOOKS OLD
THIS IS A VERY SMOOTH SUV THAT HANDLES GREAT GOOD POWER WITH GREAT VISIBILITY
WITH THREE HEADRESTS INSTALLED IN THE BACK SEATS IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE TRAFFIC VIA THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AS A RESULT I REMOVED THE MIDDLE HEADREST AND STORED IT IN THE TRUNK WITH SIDE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS INSTALLED AND THE REAR ROOF LINE
VISIBILITY OUT OF REAR WINDOW IS SUB PAR
I LIKE THE CAMERA MOUNTED ON THE REAR END OF THE ILX THE CAMERA DISPLAYS AN ACCURATE IMAGE OF WHAT S BEHIND THE VEHICLE ON THE DASHBOARD WHEN I SHIFT INTO REVERSE OCCASIONALLY I WILL BACK UP THE VEHICLE INTO A PARKING STALL WITHOUT LOOKING TH
SEATS SIT LOW AND IT MAKES IT A BIT HARD TO SEE THE FRONT AND SIDES OF THE VEHICLE WHEN YOUR NAVIGATING TIGHT SPOTS ALSO THE SIDE WINDSHIELD PANEL IS THICK AND ANGLED SO THAT IT CREATES A BLIND SPOT WHEN YOU ARE TURNING A CORNER
THERE IS A BACK UP CAMERA IN MY CAR BUT NO SENSOR I WISH IT HAD A SENSOR AS WELL
MISSED THE REAR WIPERS
HAS A SUBSTANTIAL SIDE BLIND SPOT YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF
MDX S HAVE ALWAYS HAD A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING BACK WHAT I DO LOVE IS THE NEW SAFETY FEATURE THAT TELLS YOU WHEN SOMEONE IS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU WHETHER IN THE FRONT OR BACK OF THE CAR THIS HELPS WITH THE BLIND SPOT PROBLEM
GOOD HEADLIGHTS AND OUTWARD VISIBILITY
I FEEL THERE ARE 2 BLIND SPOTS ONE BEING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDOW DUE TO THE VERY THICK MOLDING AND THE SAME THICK MOLDING BETWEEN THE SIDE WINDOWS
BETTER MIRROR ON RIGHT SIDE BACKUP CAMERAS ON ALL VEHICLES
LANE CHANGE ASSISTANCE SYSTEM IS GREAT ON THIS CAR VISIBILITY OTHERWISE IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY OLD MDX SO APPRECIATE THE SYSTEM
REALLY LIKE BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY
COLLISION DETECTION SYSTEM IS AWESOME
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE EXCELLENT THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO BLIND SPOTS ALSO THE HEADLIGHTS ARE FANTASTIC THEY LIGHT UP THE ROAD WITH OUT BLINDING ON COMING VEHICLES
THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE TINY AND SLOPED DOWN MAKING THE FIELD OF VISION SMALL THE BACK SLOPES DOWN LIMITING THE REAR VIEW THE HEAD RESTS TAKE UP MUCH OF THE FIELD OF VISION ESPECIALLY WITH THE THIRD ROW SEATS
THE STYLING I LOVE SO MUCH CAUSING THE REAR WINDOW AND SIDE GLASS BETWEEN THE C AND D PILLARS TO BE SMALLER THAN I D LIKE FOR VISIBILITY THAT SAID LARGE SIDE MIRRORS HELP ALSO INCLUSION OF BLIND SPOT MONITORING AS STANDARD ON ALL MODELS WOULD
COULD USE MORE ALERT SYSTEMS FOR SAFETY
VISIBILITY IS LIMITED IN BACK CARGO AREAS WHEN CHANGING LANES
VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES
I WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO KEEP THE REAR CAMERA LENS FROM LOSING VISIBILITY WHEN WET 
DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF REAR WINDOW AND MANY BLIND SPOTS FOR 5 2 PERSON
REAR SET BELT COMING OUT OF THE CEILING OBSTRUCTS THE REAR VIEW ALL CARS SHOULD HAVE THE REAR SENSORS WHICH BEEP REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE REAR BACKUP SYSTEM IS ON THE CAMERA
SIDE MIRRORS COULD BE LARGER BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE
REAR BLIND SPOTS AT THE OUTSIDE CORNERS REQUIRE EXTRA CARE TO BE DOUBLE SURE IT S SAFE TO CHANGE LANES BACK UP PASS OR TURN
BRAKES ARE SOFT AND MUSHY LOVE THE CAR AND ENJOY DRIVING IT NEED MORE TIME TO EXPERIENCE ALL THAT IT OFFERS HAVE NOT PLAYED WITH NAV SYSTEM ENOUGH TO HAVE IT FIGURED OUT NEED MORE TIME TO USE VOICE COMMANDS WILL TALK TO DEALER ABOUT MINOR
WITH THE HEADLIGHTS AND DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS I CAN SEE THE ENTIRE ROAD WHICH IS AWESOME
I DON T CARE FOR THE ASPECT RATIO OF THE BACK UP CAMERA I DON T FIND IT GIVES AN ACCURATE DISTANCE OF OBJECTS BEHIND THE VEHICLE I WISH IT CAME WITH THE BACK UP ASSIST WHERE IT BEEPS TO LET YOU KNOW YOU ARE CLOSE TO AN OBJECT WHEN IN REVERSE
THE LED JEWEL HEADLIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL AND PROVIDES EXCELLENT VISIBILITY
I LOVE THE SAFETY FEATURES THAT TELL ME WHEN I CROSS THE LINE HAVE SOMETHING IN MY BLIND SIDE AND IF I GET TO CLOSE TO SOMEONE IN FRONT OF ME I FEEL VERY SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR
LOVE LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND BACK UP CAMERA ESPECIALLY ALERT WHEN CAR IS APPROACHING
WITH THE CONVERTIBLE TOP UP REAR VISIBILITY IS LOW AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY BLIND SPOTS HOWEVER IT IS TO BE EXPECTED
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT THAT WASN T THERE IN MY 2001 ACURA BUT THEN IT MIGHT JUST BE ME
TOOK A LITTLE GETTING USE TO HAD A MAZDA 6 WHICH I BELIEVE HAD BETTER OVERALL VISABILITY
BLIND SPOT INDICATOR IS FANTASTIC
VERY USER FRIENDLY NICE RIDE WITH SAFETY
I HAVE VERY FEW BLIND SPOTS COMPARED TO MY PREVIOUS CAR VOLVO XC90 MY HUSBAND COMMENTED THAT HE COULDN T SEE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW WHEN BACKING I HAVEN T FOUND THAT TO BE A PROBLEM PARTICULARLY WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BACKUP CAMER
MY VISIBILITY ISSUES MAY BE BECAUSE I AM TALL AND THE CONVERTIBLE TOP PLACEMENT AND MY HEIGHT DO NOT COINCIDE HOWEVER I DON T MIND AT ALL SINCE IT FORCES ME TO BE EVEN MORE CAUTIOUS WHEN CLEARING BLIND SPOTS AND CHANGING LANES AS FAR AS THE VIS
BIGGEST IMPACT TO VISIBILITY IS THICK PILLARS BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR DOORS BLIND SPOT ALERT SYSTEM REARVIEW CAMERA AND PARKING ASSIST SYSTEMS DO EXCELLENT JOB OF MITIGATING VISIBILITY ISSUES
FROM DRIVER SEAT RIGHT SIDE VISIBILITY IS POOR AND CLOSE TO UNACCEPTABLE IF THE PASSENGER SEAT IS EVEN SLIGHTLY RECLINED OR THE HEADREST IS POSITIONED IN THE WRONG WAY
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS THANKFUL FOR BACKUP CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM
HORRIBLE BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING UP NOT SEEN ELECTRONICALLY
SINCE THE VEHICLE S STYLING LIMITS THE REAR VISIBILITY THE BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY USEFUL I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE SELECTED THAT OPTION BUT AM VERY GLAD THE VEHICLE CAME WITH IT ANYWAY
IT IS GOOD TO HAVE LANE CHANGING OPTION BECAUSE SEEING OUT BACK WINDOW {PARTICULARLY TO THE SIDES CREATES BLIND SPOTS
THE MOST IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE IN ANY CAR IS RESPONSIVENESS THE A4 GETS AN A+ IN THAT SUBJECT
SEEMS TO BE SOME BLIND SPOTS AND IT S DIFFICULT TO BACK UP THE CAR
NOT BAD FOR A CONVERTABLE BLIND SPOT WARNING IS A MUST
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS WAY TOO SMALL THAT S REALLY MY ONLY VISIBILITY ISSUE WITH THE CAR FOR DRIVING SAFETY I WOULD HAVE LIKE MAYBE THE KIND OF DRIVING ASSIST SYSTEM WHERE IT MAKES A NOISE IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WHEN SWITCHING LANES OR EVEN IF
THERE IS A SMALL BLIND SPOT OUT THE PASSENGERS BACK CORNER WINDOW REAR WINDOW THIS IS ONLY WHEN THE TOP IS UP MY CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE WHEN TOP DOWN ITS FINE I THINK THIS IS JUST AN ISSUE WITH A RAG ROOF
REAR PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT
SUN VISORS ARE NOT WIDE ENOUGH OR NOT MOUNTED WHERE THEY ARE EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING SUN VISIBILTY
IT SEEMS FINE TO ME BUT THEN I JUST READ THAT IT FAILED CRASH TESTS
I INSTALLED EUROPEAN BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR THEY WORK WONDERFULLY I WISH I HAD A BLIND SPOT MONITORING ELECTRONIC SYSTEM
BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT BACK
PARKING LOT VISIBILITY IS ALMOST NON EXISTENT WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE
I VE BEEN CAUGHT WITH BLIND SPOT SITUATIONS THAT I DIDN T EXPECT A FEW TIMES GETTING USED TO BEING MORE CAUTIOUS AS A RESULTS DISAPPOINTED IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REAR WIPER BLADE SEEMS TO SMUDGE RATHER THAN CLEAN
EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY
LATERAL VISIBILITY CAN BE IMPROVED BY DECREASING THE WIDTH OF THE BAR BETWEEN THE DOORS
WOULD LIKED BETTER VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR OF SOFT TOP
I HAVE ANSWERED WITH THE CONVERTIBLE TOP UP WITH IT DOWN EVERYTHING IS VISIBLE
CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE VISIBILITY IS SLIGHTLY LESS WHEN TOP IS UP
ACTIVE LANE ASSIST AND DYNAMIC CRUISE CONTROL ARE TWO FEATURES THAT WERE IMPORTANT TO US IN PICKING A VEHICLE THEY ARE VERY WELL IMPLEMENTED IN THE A6 AND WE ARE EVER SO GLAD WE GOT THOSE FEATURES
THE CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH REAR FOG LIGHTS WHICH ARE MORE INTENSE THAN TAIL LAMPS BUT NOT AS BRIGHT AS BRAKE LIGHTS THIS MAKES THE VEHICLE MORE VISIBLE FROM THE REAR IN POOR VISIBILITY DRIVING CONDITIONS AND A NICE EXTRA SAFETY FEATURE NOT SEEN O
DRIVER SAFETY FEATURES WORK WELL AND ARE NOT INTRUSIVE
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS GREAT BUT I STILL FEEL LIKE I DON T KNOW WHERE THE TWO BACK CORNERS OF THE VEHICLE ARE I VE ONLY 1100 MILES ON IT AND I WAS USED TO DRIVING AN SUV SO I AM STILL GETTING USED TO THE CAR THE CAR IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIGGE
MY CAR HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS INSPIRE CONFIDENCE IN MY SAFETY WHEN DRIVING
BLIND SPOT IN THE FRONT PASSENGER DOOR TO FRONT WINDOW
LACK OF LANE DEPARTURE AUTO BRAKING AND REAR VIEW CAMERA ARE SHORT COMINGS
WITH THE OPTIONAL CAMERA SYSTEM THAT IS INCLUDED WITH MY CAR REAR AND PARKING VISIBILITY ARE EXCELLENT
THIS CARS REDESIGN HAS VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED A BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOTS FORCE YOU TO ANGLE THE SIDE MIRRORS WIDE
REAR BLIND SPOTS THANKFUL FOR THE REAR RADAR
IT HAS A BACK UP CAMERA BUT IT IS HARD TO SEE WHEN BACKING THIS VEHICLE
COLLISION DETECTION IS VERY NICE I DIDN T REALLY THINK I WOULD USE IT BUT THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW TIMES I HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL FOR THE LIGHT AND THE BEEP TO LET ME KNOW SOMEONE WAS IN MY BLIND SPOT
I HAVE DRIVEN THE QUEST LESS THAN 1200 MILES SO FAR SO AM STILL GETTING USED TO IT MY FIRST MINIVAN SO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION I DO NOT LIKE THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR WHERE I HAD IT SET ORIGINALLY LEFT ME WITH A HUGE BLIND SPOT NEARLY
LOVE THE CRUISE CONTROL WITH SONAR
WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR I FEEL THIS VEHICLE WOULD BE UNSAFE BUT LUCKILY I HAVE THAT
LOVE THE BRAKES SYSTEM AND GREAT ACCELERATION ESPECIALLY WHEN NEEDED FOR SAFETY PURPOSES GREAT IMPROVEMENT ON STEERING CONTROLS BETTER VISUAL DISPLAY
THIS IS MY 3RD MURANO SO AS YOU CAN TELL I AM A FAN THE REAR TAILLIGHT BACKUP LIGHT DESIGN AND PLACEMENT OF THE BACK UP CAMERA HAS BY FAR BEEN THE BEST IN THE MURANO WHEN I BOUGHT THE I WAS SO SURPRISED BY THE TERRIBLE GLARE FROM EI
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SHOW BLIND SPOT CARS BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS MURANO
I PUT SMALL CONVEX MIRRORS ON THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS REALLY HELPED WITH VISIBILITY
I LOVE THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM BECAUSE THE BLIND SPOT IS JUST THAT A BLIND SPOT I HAD THE WINDOWS TINTED AND IT IS MUCH BETTER THAT WAY AGAIN I WOULD THINK ALL CARS OF THIS PRICE WOULD HAVE TINTED WINDOWS
THERE IS A REALLY BAD BLIND SPOT WHEN YOU TRY TO CHANGE LANES TO THE LEFT LIKE REALLY BAD OTHERWISE EVERYTHING ELSE IS GREAT
BLIND SPOT LOOKING RIGHT REAR WITH AN ACCUTE ANGLE ROAD INTERSECTION
TERRIBLE BLIND SPOTS ALL OVER VEHICLE
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT WHEN MAKING A TURN TO THE LEFT THIS HAS LED TO SOME CLOSE CALLS ESPECIALLY ON COUNTRY ROADS THAT HAVE A LOT OF TURNS AND NO CLEARLY DEFINED LANES
NEED BIGGER REAR VIEW MIRRORS
BECAUSE OF LIMITED VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES THE WARNING SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE AND IS REALLY GREAT FEATURE
WIDE PILLARS CAUSE A BIG BLIND SPOT WHEN CHECKING TO THE SIDE REAR ANGLES
THE DOOR FRAME WHERE THE MIRRORS ARE MOUNTED IS A LITTLE TOO THICK REDUCING VISIBILITY
THE VISIBILITY OF THE VEHICLES HEADLIGHT SYSTEM FOR NIGHT DRIVING IS EXCEPTIONAL
NO BLIND SPOT MONITOR AVAILABLE ON LIMITED MODEL
NOT SURE HOW LANE DEPARTURE WARNING WORKS
BACKUP CAMERA IS BETTER THAN ON PREVIOUS PRIUS IT HAS LINES WHICH HELP TO JUDGE DISTANCE FROM OBSTACLES
I LIKE THE REAR CAMERA IT GREATLY IMPROVES REVERSE VISIBILITY
I LIKE THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM THAT LETS ME KNOW IF A CAR IS IN MY BLIND SPOT ALSO FIND THE REAR WARNING SYSTEM EFFECTIVE WITH PEOPLE OR OBSTACLES THAT ARE NEAR MY PATH
SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE EXTREMELY SMALL FOR A TOWING VEHICLE
I WISH THE SUN VISOR EXTENDED I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THE ALERT SYSTEM OF SIDE TO SIDE ONCOMING TRAFFIC IT HAS GREAT VISIBILITY THRU THE CAMERA
THE LANE CHANGING SYSTEM HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL WITH BLIND SPOTS SINCE THE VEHICLE IS SO BIG
REAR BLIND SPOT WHEN USING FREEWAY TURNAROUNDS BLOCKS VIEW OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC A 30 TO 40 DEGREE REAR ANGLE TO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC BLOCKS MULTIPLE LANES OF ONCOMING TRAFFIC PASSENGER HAS TO TELL ME IF THE ROAD IS CLEAR I AM LEARNING TO STOP W
THE FRONT PILLARS ARE A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT
REAR CAMERA MAKES UP FOR POOR REAR VISIBILITY
I WISH THE HEADLIGHTS WERE BRIGHTER AND HAD A GREATER DISTANCE OF VISIBILITY
EXTENSIVE BLIND SPOTS ON DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE OF VEHICLE DUE TO VERTICAL COLUMNS BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR DOORS MAY BE DUE TO SIDE COLLISION AIR BAGS HAVING THE BLIND SPOT WARNING DOES HELP WITH THIS ISSUE BUT NOT WHEN LOOKING FOR ONC
VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS IMPAIRED BY A WIDE BAR LIKE ITEM THAT CROSSES THE WINDOW FROM SIDE TO SIDE THE SIDE POSTS BETWEEN FRONT WINDOW AND DOORS SEEM TO BE A BIT WIDER THAN I AM USE TO WHICH ALSO IMPEDES VISION AT THE ANGLES
FROM OUTSIDE THE REAR OF THE CAR IS REALLY NICE LOVE THE SPOILER THE TAIL LIGHTS THE WHOLE SHEE BANG OBVIOUSLY THAT ALL CAME AT THE COST OF REAR VISION THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERAS BALANCE THE EQUATION BARELY WAS
THERE IS A TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT BUT IT IS MADE OK BY THE CAMERA THAT IS INSTALLED ON THE PASSENGER MIRROR
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT TO LEFT REAR FROM DRIVERS SEAT SPLIT MIRROR IS A DISTRACTION
THE CAMERA ON THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS JUST OUTSTANDING
THE RIGHT SIDE BLIND SPOT CAMERA FOR MAKING RIGHT TURNS IT S A LIFESAVER
I WANTED TO TRY THE CRV BUT DISLIKED THE BLACK BORDER AROUND REAR WINDOW I WANT A LARGE CLEAR PIECE OF GLASS AT THE REAR ALONG WITH THE NEW SAFETY FEATURES
I M USED TO A SMALLER CAR SO CHANGING LANES I HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A BLIND SPOT DON T THINK MUCH CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 2 DOOR GOING TO 4 DOOR
FEEL THAT WINDSHIELD HAS MORE VISABILITY THAN LATER MODELS
I DO NOT LIKE THE VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT OUT THE REAR VIEW WINDOW
THE GLASS IN THE HATCH SHOULD BE 1 PIECE RATHER THAN SPLIT IN 2 THE ANGLED REAR WINDOWS SHOULD BE FLATTENED FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE CAMERA ON THE RIGHT OUTSIDE MIRROR WHEN I TURN RIGHT
PREFER WIPERS THAT GO SIDE TO SIDE RATHER THAN CENTER AND BACK MORE WINDSHIELD VISIBILITY ALSO WIPERS ARE STREAKY
THIS CAR HAS BLIND SPOTS THE SIZE OF ALASKA LEFT SIDE PILLAR BLOCKS SIGHT WHEN LOOKING OVER LEFT SHOULDER LEFT FRONT PILLAR BLOCKS SIGHT WHEN MAKING LEFT TURNS RIGHT REAR WINDOW PILLAR BLOCKS VIEW OF CARS TO THE RIGHT REAR WINDOW IS TINY AND T
I LIKE THE FRITTED GLASS AROUND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT PROTECTS AN AREA FROM THE SUN THAT THE VISORS DON T GET
LOVE THE SIDE CAMERA FOR CHANGING LANES
THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR SPLIT LACKS ENOUGH VISIBILITY FOR THE BLIND SPOT UNLESS THE MIRROR IS MOVED TO A LOCATION THAT REDUCES NORMAL LONG DISTANCE SIGHT LINE
PRIOR TO THIS CR V I HAD AN 07 CR V DESIGN OF THE POSTS THE WINDSHIELD SETS INTO HAVE CHANGED A BIT AND CREATED A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL AT STOP SIGNS BECAUSE YOU CAN LOSE SIGHT OF PEDESTRIANS
RIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR CAMERA SHOULD BE ON ALL VEHICLES
LIKE THE SIDE VIEW CAMERA
THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE SO SMALL IT MAKES IT HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES AND BACKING UP USING THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE ALWAYS HELPFUL AND I AM HAVING TO RELY ON THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA MORE OFTEN WHICH IS A NICE FEATURE BUT I LIKE BEING ABLE T
THIS VEHICLE HAS HUGE BLIND SPOTS WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS THAT ARE BESIDE YOU ON THE HIGHWAY
THE BAR AT THE BACK WINDOW BLOCKS VISIBILITY WITH REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER HAS NEVER QUITE CLEARED THE WINDSHIELD COMPLETELTY I THINK THAT THE ANGLE OF THE WIPER IS SLIGHTLY ASKEW
LIKE THE SIDE WINDOW VISIBILITY AND RIGHT TURN CAMERA
IF IT WAS BUILT THAT YOU DID NOT FEEL THE BUMPS WHEN GO OVER THEM AND THE REAR WIPER WAS A LONGER ABOUT 6 TO 12 INCHES IT WOULD BE HEAVENLY
LOVE THE CAMERA FOR THE RIGHT LANE
BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE MAKES DEPENDING ON MIRRORS VERY QUESTIONABLE SO I HAVE TO TURN AROUND AND LOOK WHICH CREATES A SAFETY HAZARD
I WISH THERE WAS A CAMERA ON THE LEFT SIDE MIRROR
THE SIDE CAMERA HELPS OUT A LOT IT TAKES CARE OF MY BLIND SIDE
I LOVE THE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA TO CHANGE LANES I WISH THERE WAS A DRIVER S SIDE CAMERA JUST LIKE IT FOR CHANGING LANES THAT COMES ON WHEN SIGNALING TO MOVE LEFT IT WOULD BE PERFECT
I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH YOUR ATTEMPT TO ELIMINATE THE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE THE SPLIT MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE IS VERY INEFFECTIVE THE CAMERA ON THE RIGHT MIRROR IS OKEY BUT I DON T RELY ON IT COMPLETELY
I REALLY LIKE THE CAMERA ON THE PASSENGER SIDE VIEW MIRROR
I REALLY LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA
BEST VISIBILITY OF ANY CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM SHOULD REALLY BE INCLUDED ON THE EXL TRIM LEVEL
TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT REAR WHEN CHANGLING LANES
THIS IS MY FIRST CAR IN 15 YEARS THE VISIBILITY IS WAY LESS FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CAR I LOVE MY CAMERA ON THE RIGHT SIDE AND WITHOUT THAT IT WOULD BE AWFUL TO DRIVE ON THE HIGHWAY MY CHILDREN TELL ME THAT THE LACK OF VISIBILITY IN THE NEW CARS
THE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA GETS A LITTLE ANNOYING WHEN IT COMES ON FOR EVERY RIGHT TURN NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE
SIDE AND REAR VISIBILITY ISN T GREAT THE BLIND SPOT IS BLOCKED BY THE SPACE BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR WINDOWS THE SIDE REAR WINDOWS ARE SMALL AND THE REAR WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY THE HEADRESTS
A SIDE MOUNTED CAMERA ON THE DRIVERS SIDE WOULD BE NICE FOR BLIND SPOT STUFF
THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFTSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD WHERE THE WINDSHIELD & SMOKERS WINDOW MEET BECAUSE OF THE TRIANGLE STRUCTURE OF THE SUPPORT COLUMNS
WHEN LOOKING TO THE LEFT FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT THE PANEL THAT SEPARATES THE DRIVER S DOOR WINDOW FROM THE SMALLER WINDOW BEFORE THE WINDSHIELD IS TOO THINK AND CREATES A RATHER LARGE BLINDSPOT WHEN TURNING LEFT
WHEN TEST DRIVING ODYSSEYS I DID NOT CARE FOR LANE WATCH VISIBILITY TO PASSENGER SIDE TRAFFIC AS I FOUND IT DISTRACTING NOW THAT I HAVE USED IT I FIND IT TO BE ONE OF THE BEST FEATURES I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT FOR DRIVER S SIDE TRAFFIC A
THE SIDE VIEW CAMERA IS A GREAT HELP WHEN TURNING AND PARALLEL PARKING
LOVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AND THE SIDE CAMERA I FEEL LIKE I CAN SEE BIKE RIDERS AND PEDESTRIANS SO MUCH BETTER
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A CAMERA ON THE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR ALSO WHEN TURN SIGNAL IS ON TO HAVE A BETTER VIEW OF CARS LOVE LOVE LOVE THE LEFT SIDE CAMERA
DRIVER S SIDE VISIBILITY INTO BLADE SPOT IS MADE WORSE BY LACK OF ABILITY TO MOVE MIRROR FAR ENOUGH TO LEFT VISIBILITY FORWARD IS DIMINISHED BY GLARE FROM OVERLY SHINY DASHBOARD
GREAT EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE WINDSHIELD BUT REAR WIPER COVERAGE IS TOO SMALL LEFT SIDE MIRROR DOESN T ANGLE OUTWARD ENOUGH
LOVE THE CAMERA ON THE RIGHT REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE REAR CAMERA IS VERY GOOD BUT SOMETIMES YOU DO WANT TO LOOK WITH YOUR EYES AND THAT IS DIFFICULT
I LIKE THE OVERALL VISIBILITY OF MY NEW CAR INCLUDING THE REAR AND RIGHT TURN CAMERAS I REALLY DO FEEL MUCH SAFER IN MY CR V
REALLY LIKE REAR CAMERA WHEN IN REVERSE AND THE SIDE CAMERA THAT ACTIVATES WHEN RIGHT TURN SIGNAL IS ON MAKES IT MUCH EASIER AND SAFER WHEN PASSING AND RETURNING TO SLOW LANE ON INTERSTATE
LOVE THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS FRONT AND BACK AS THEY COVER MOST OF WINDOW
HONDA ADDED 2 CAMERAS TO THE EX MODEL THE SIDE VIEW CAMERA FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR COMES ON ANY TIME YOU USE THE INDICATOR TO TURN OR CHANGE LANES TO THE RIGHT YOU CAN ALSO MANUALLY TURN IT ON ANY TIME YOU LIKE TO SEE THE EXTERIOR PASSENG
AIRBAGS WAS THE MOST APPEALING WHEN I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE TO LEARN THAT THERE WAS A DEFECT IN DRIVER AIRBAG ASSEMBLY AT DELIVERY IS THE WORST THING EXTREMELY DIS SATISFIED THAT HONDA DOESNT RECOGNIZE THAT AND IS NOT WILLING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
IT NEEDS MORE SIDE AND FORWARD WARNING SYSTEM
THE SIZE AND SHAPE OF THE WINDOW ALONG WITH THE POSITIONING OF THE SEAT GIVES A FEELING OF EXCELLENT VISIBILITY
LOVE THE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA FOR LANE CHANGING
HARD TO SEE VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES LARGE BLIND SPOTS
XENON HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL MODELS AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING SHOULD BE AN OPTION ON ALL TRIM LEVELS NOT JUST THE TOP OF THE LINE TOURING ELITE
THE SECOND ROW PASSENGER SEAT HEAD REST COMPLETELY BLOCKS THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR WINDOW THE FONT ON THE SMALL ODOMETER IS TOO SMALL
LEFT DRIVERS MIRROR HAS BIG BLIND SPOT
I LIKE THE CAMERA FOR BACKING UP VERY CLEAR PICTURE
HARD TO JUDGE TRAFFIC BEHIND YOU WHEN YOU ARE BACKING UP CANNOT ONLY RELY ON CAMERA USED TO TURNING AROUND AND LOOKING THROUGH REAR WINDOW
BACK UP CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD VERY HARD TO SEE IN REVERSE
REAR VIEW CAMERA AND PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA ON DOOR MIRROR ARE EXCELLENT THEY MAKE DRIVING SO MUCH EASIER BY BEING ABLE TO SEE IN WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE BLIND SPOTS
THICKNESS OF PILLARS BETWEEN FRONT WINDSHIELD AND FRONT SIDE WINDOWS CAUSES A BLIND SPOT
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT CAMERA
NEED CAMERA IN THE MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE
I LOVE THE WIDE ANGLE MIRROR IN THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR HELPS ELIMINATE BLIND SPOTS
I EXPERIENCE EXTREMELY POOR VISIBILITY IF I TURN MY HEAD TO CHECK FOR CARS BEHIND TRUNK IS NO GOOD DESIGNED
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS THE DRIVER SIDE FRAME OF CAR THAT CONNECTS TO WINDSHIELD IT S RATHER WIDE AND MAKES AN INCONVENIENT BLIND SPOT
MY SON ROLLED HIS PREVIOUS HYUNDAI ACCENT 3 TIMES WHILE DRIVING A YEAR AGO ALTHOUGH THE AIRBAGS WERE NOT DEPLOYED BECAUSE THERE WAS NO DIRECT IMPACT MY SON SUFFERED ONLY A COUPLE OF SCRATCHES ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE WAS TOTALED THE SEATBEL
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVER S SEAT WHEN CHANGING LANES BOTH TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT
ADDING THE SPLIT OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR DRIVERS SIDE WAS OVERDUE PLEASE PUT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE TOO THE REAR BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE DRIVERS RIGHT IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE AS FAR AS OVERALL DESIGN GOES NOT SURE WHAT T
SMALL REAR GLASS IS ATTRACTIVE EXTERIOR FEATURE BUT MAKES REAR VISIBILITY SOMETIME DIFFICULT
THERE IS A SMALL BLIND SPOT BUT THE SIDE MIRRORS REALLY HELP
DON T LIKE THE SPEEDOMETER SCREEN JUMPING FROM 20 TO 40 TO 60 ETC IF I WANT TO GO 45 OR 50 I HAVE TO GLANCE AT THE SCREEN TWO OR THREE TIMES TO MAKE SURE I M AT THE RIGHT SPEED
VISIBILITY IS WHERE THE BOXINESS OF THE DESIGN PAYS OFF
VEHICLE DOES NOT HAVE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
MY SON S NEW CIVIC HAD A CAMERA VIEW FOR TURNING RIGHT OUR CAR COST $20 000 MORE AND DOES NOT DISAPPOINTED THAT MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE THAT FEATURE
POOR VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING LEFT
I REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SIDE MIRROR AS WELL AS THE BACKUP CAMERA
FRONT PILLARS ARE LARGER THAN PREVIOUS VEHICLE AND MODERATELY OBSTRUCT PERIPHERAL FRONT VIEW
SEE YOU EARLIER COMMENT ABOUT FORWARD VISIBILITY
THE PASSENGER HEAD REST REALLY GETS IN THE WAY WHEN LOOKING OVER BUT I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR IT MAKES LOOKING OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER A LOT EASIER
WIPER BLADES SWEEP THE WINDSHIELD THERE IS A GAP THAT IS NOT WIPED AWAY ON THE BOTTOM OF PASSENGER SIDE POOR DESIGN WITH NO FIX AS PER THE DEALER
I LIKE THE WARNING THAT THE CAR PROVIDES IF I AM BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE AND A CAR IS DRIVING TOWARD AND BEHIND ME IN MANY INSTANCES THIS IS TRULY A BLINDSPOT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY COMPENSATES FOR
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SEEM TO BE VERY FLIMSY AND SOMETIMES LEAVE STREAKING
WELL THOUGHT OUT AND THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE STATE OF THE ART
GOOD VISIBILITY AND ELECTRONIC AIDS ADD EXTRA LEVEL OF SAFETY FEELING
A POSTS SHOULD BE THINNER FOR BETTER SIDE VISABILITY
VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD
THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK AT LOWER SPEEDS LIKE IN STOP AND GO TRAFFIC
REALLY LIKE SIDE MIRRORS HELP WHEN CHANGING LANES SIGNAL LETS ME KNOW BLIND SPOT ANOTHER VEHICLE IS ON MY SIDE
ROOF SUPPORTS IN FRONT CORNERS OF WINDSHEILD CAUSE BLIND SPOTS I EXPECT THIS IS UNAVOIDABLE DUE TO SAFETY NEEDS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN MAKING SLIGHT LEFT TURNS DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE FRAME BETWEEN THE DRIVER S WINDOW AND THE WINDSHIELD THE REAR LED TAIL LIGHTS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AT NIGHT MAKING THE CAMERA QUALITY SEEM
DUE TO THE LENGTH AND PITCH OF THE HOOD I FEEL THE FORWARD VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS ON PREVIOUS MODELS I FIND MYSELF RELYING MORE ON THE PARKING ASSIST CAPABILITIES OF THE VEHICLE RATHER THAN MY DRIVING CAPABILITIES
THE CONVEX MIRROR IS TO SMALL AND NOT HAVING A PASSENGER SIDE ONE IS RIDICULOUS
SMALL BLIND SPOT PASSENGER SIDE DRIVER MIRROR HAS BUILT IN DISTANCE SMALL MIRROR BIG HELP WHEN PASSING REAR VIEW MIRROR COVERS A WIDE VIEW
THE INTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR DOESN T ALLOW FOR A GREAT VIEW I THINK THIS IS IN PART DUE TO THE SEEMINGLY NARROW REAR WINDOW THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE BIG AND VERY USEFUL
SMALL CARS NEXT TO YOU WHEN ANGLED PARKED ARE NOT VERY VISIBLE TO SEE NEXT TO THE VEHICLE WITHOUT USING SIDE MIRROR
LOTS OF FEATURES TO HELP BRING AWARENESS WISH IT HAD A BLIND SPOT MONITOR
THE DRIVER S WINDSHIELD WIPER GO FARTHER TO THE LEFT
A POINT SIZE LIMITS VISIBILITY
SHOULD HAVE ADDED THE INTEGRATED BLIND SPOT MIRROR IN THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR NOT JUST THE DRIVER SIDE
AS STATED BEFORE BLIND SPOT IN SPOT MIRROR
NEEDS BETTER HEADLIGHTS
NEED TO ADD AUTO WIPERS WHEN THE WINDSHIELD GETS WET FIX THE LOW VISIBILITY OF THE HEADLIGHTS
HEADLIGHT LOW BEAMS ARE DECENT HIGH BEAMS ARE PATHETICALLY POOR WORST FEATURE OF THE VEHICLE BY FAR
THE SLANT OF THE WINDSHIELD PUTS THE ROOF LINE INN YOUR EYE SIGHT MAKING THE VISIBLE AREA YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FRONT SMALL ALSO THE A PILLAR IS SO WIDE YOU HAVE A MAJOR BLIND SPOT
BLIND SIDE MIRROR TOO SMALL
LARGE TRAILER MIRRORS NEED TO BE LOWERED THEY BLOCK LEFT AND RIGHT VIEW VERY DANGEROUS AT 4 WAY STOP OR IN PARKING LOT WITH PEOPLE WALKING
THE LARGE REAR SIDE VIEW MIRRORS CAUSE BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY WITH SMALL VEHICLES I PERSONNALLY HAVE COME CLOSE TO HAVING TWO COLLISIONS DUE TO THE OVERSIZED REAR SIDE VIEW MIRRORS VERY SMALL VEHICLE ARE DIFFICULT TO SEE AT A FOUR WAY INTERSECTI
THE SIDE MIRROWS SHOULD BE SOME WHAT SEMI ROUND INSTEAD OF FLAT BING SOME WHAT ROUNDS WILL GIVE ME A BETTER VISIBILITY THE SUN VISORS COULD BE BETTER IF THEY HAD AN EXTENTION COMING FROM THE INSIDE OF THE SUN VISOR
THE FRONT POST FOR WINDSHIELD IS HARD TO SEE AROUND CAUSING A BIG BLIND SPOT
SIDE MIRRORS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD AT SEEING OTHER VEHICLES IN YOUR BLIND SPOTS
WISH THE TRUCK HAD AUTO WIPERS AND SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE RIGHT IN FROM OF FRONT BUMPER A FRONT CAMERA WOULD HELP
REAR CAMERA IS VERY GOOD
INITIALLY I FELT NERVOUS ABOUT THE VISIBILITY FRONT SIDES AND REAR WHEN DRIVING IN BUSY PARKING LOTS IT FELT LIKE MY VIEW WAS LIMITED AFTER DRIVING THE TERRAIN FOR 2+ MONTHS NOW I NO LONGER FEEL THAT WAY I THINK IT WAS JUST GETTING USED TO
WITH OURS THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT WHEN TURNING RIGHT OR LEFT SINCE WE HAVE THE BIG MIRRORS FOR TOWING
SIDE MIRROR BLIND SPOT
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS BECAUSE OF THE HEIGHT OF THE TRUCK
THE CAMPER MIRRORS HAVING THE CONVEX LOWER LENS HELPS WITH VEHICLES THAT NORMALLY WOULD BE IN A BLIND SPOT I LIKE THE OVERALL LARGER CAMPER MIRRORS FOR VISIBILITY
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BAD BLIND SPOT I DON T THINK THE REAR WINDOW OR SIDE WINDOWS ARE BIG ENOUGH
I FIND THAT I HAVE TROUBLE WITH VISIBILITY WHEN I M A MAKING LEFT TURNS NOT SURE IF THE SIDE MIRROR IS TOO WIDE OR IT S THAT MY SEAT IS TOO HIGH WHICH MAKES MY VISION EVEN WITH THE MIRROR I LIKE THAT FEATURE TO BE ABLE TO RAISE THE SEAT IT GIVE
DIFFICULT TO PARK BETWEEN LINES DUE TO INABILITY TO SEE OVER FRONT FENDERS
FOR THE PK THAT I LEASED NEED TO COME WITH LED HEADLIGHTS
THERE IS A BIG BLIND SPOT LOOKING BACK TO THE RIGHT
WISH VISIBILITY IS WIDER FROM BOTH DIRVERS AND PASSENGER SIDE
NEED AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS TO APPEAR WHEN INSERTING THE KEY NOT HAVING TO MANUALLY TURN ON AND OFF THE LIGHTS WHICH IS A PAIN WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AUTOMATIC LOCKS WHEN ENGINE STARTS AS WELL
WOULD LIKE LARGER AND BRIGHTER HEADLIGHTS
HARD TO SEE PARKING STOPS IN FRONT WHAT ABOUT A CAMERA IN THE FRONT LIKE THE ONE IN THE BACK
I FIND THERE IS A VERY LARGE BLIND SPOT IF I AM TRYING TO SWITCH INTO THE RIGHT LANE
FORWARD VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT IS THE BEST
VISIBILITY TO THE REAR CORNERS STILL FEELS RESTRICTED POINTS OF COMPARISON ARE A KIA SEDONA AND A FORD FOCUS WAGON ZTW
VISIBILITY IS FINE OTHER THAN LOOKING OVER LEFT SHOULDER WHEN SHIFTING LANES OR MERGING
VISIBILITY THROUGH BACK WINDOW NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
VERY LARGE BLIND SPOTS
SHAPE OF THE BACK WINDOW OBSTRUCTS REAR VIEW
THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR HAS A LITTLE BLIND SPOT SECTION WHICH IS GREAT FOR CHECKING FOR CARS WHEN CHANGING LANES ADD THAT LITTLE EXTRA BLIND SPOT MIRROR TO THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR TOO
SIDE MIRROR IMPEDES VISION POOR VIEW OUT THE BACK WINDOW I USE THE CAMERA A LOT
ADDING BLIND SPOT MONITOR SYSTEM WOULD BE GREAT THE REAR CAMERA IS GREAT CHOICE THE BLIND SPOT SMALL MIRROR IS A GREAT AND WELCOME ADDITION
YOU CAN T SEE ANYONE ON THE SIDE OF YOU IT HAS BLINDSIDE MIRRORS BUT THEY AREN T VERY USEFUL VERY HARD TO SEE AROUND YOU AT ALL ESP WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE REAR VIEW IS SOMEWHAT AWKWARD WITH THE SMALL LOW REAR WINDOW AND THE SOLID PIECE BETWEEN THE REAR WINDOW AND ROOF WINDOW NOT AWFUL JUST AWKWARD
THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE HAS A HUGE BLIND SPOT I AM OFTEN EXTREMELY HESITANT TO MERGE TO THE RIGHT LANE AND IN A CITY THAT IS VERY INCONVENIENT
UNFORTUNATELY THE TECH PACKAGE FOR THE VELOSTER DOES NOT INCLUDE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS THE CAR HAS BAD BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES SO WE HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES
WITH IT BEING A HATCHBACK AND THE WAY THE WINDOWS ARE SMALL IN THE BACK IT MAKES IT HARD TO SEE HOWEVER THERE IS A BACKUP CAMERA AND I HAVE NO PROBLEMS IF THERE WAS NO CAMERA IT WOULD BE A BIG PROBLEM SEEING OUT THE BACK
BLIND SPOTS IN REAR VISIBILITY
I VE NEVER HIT CURBS BEFORE THIS CAR AND IT S HAPPENED THREE TIMES ALREADY ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE SOMETHING ABOUT HOW LOW IT IS CAUSES LOW VISIBILITY IN THAT CORNER
REAR VISIBILITY IS PRETTY BAD THE AMOUNT OF REAR WINDOW YOU CAN SEE OUT OF VERY SMALL I THINK ELIMINATING THE BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS WOULD HELP A LOT AS WELL AS GETTING RID OF THE BLACK BAR THAT RUNS ALONG THE UPPER PORTION OF THE WINDOW THE REA
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON MY DRIVER SIDE
THE BLIND SPOTS ON THIS CAR ARE PRETTY BAD THERE IS LITTLE MORE THAN THE OPTION OF USING SIDE VIEW MIRRORS BECAUSE A DIRECT VIEW OF THE RIGHT HAND BLIND SPOT IS NEAR IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO HOW THE CAR IS CONSTRUCTED
REMOVED REAR SEAT HEADRESTS WHICH BLOCKED SOME OF REAR VISION WHILE USING THE MIRROR
REAR VISIBILITY IS ACCEPTABLE GIVEN THE SPORTY DESIGN AND THE REAR SPOILER WE FELT THAT HYUNDAI DID AN VERY GOOD JOB OF BALANCING REAR VISIBILITY WITH THE STYLING
I REALLY LIKE THE ADDED MIRROR TO THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR BUT WHEN LOOKING REAR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE THERE IS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT
SIDE VISIBILITY IS POOR AND OBSTRUCTED
I WISH IT CAME WITH BLIND SPOT STANDARD AND NOT PART OF AN EXPENSIVE ADDED PACKAGE WITH ITEMS I DID NOT WANT
THERE IS A SMALL BLIND SPOT ON THE PASS SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THAN GOODNESS FOR THE SIDE MIRRORS WHICH IS SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE DO NOT USE
THERE ARE DEFINITELY BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDES I VE ADDED SMALL CONVEX MIRRORS TO BOTH SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AND THAT HELPS
WITH THE LOWER RATING OF REAR VISION THE HEADREST OF THE BACK MIDDLE SEAT DOES HINDER VISIBILITY MORE THAN IF IT WEREN T THERE OF COURSE LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA LIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL
BETTER THAN MOST CARS BUT WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE THE CENTER MIRROR BLOCK LESS OF THE FRONT VIEW
WOULD LIKE LARGER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS WOULD LIKE BACK UP TO HAVE SONOR WARNINGS
CHANGING TO LEFT LANE WHILE DRIVING IS A NIGHTMARE THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT DRIVER CAN NOT SEE ANYTHING ON THE LEFT THROUGH REAR WINDOW
BLIND SPOT IN REAR VIEW MIRROR
EVEN THE ALTIMA HAS LANE CHANGE WARNINGS THEY CHEAPED OUT ON THIS CAR
AFTER PURCHASING THE CAR IT TOOK SOME TIME TO GET USE TO THE LANE CHANGE PROTECTION AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
REALLY LIKE THE BACK UP COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURE
ONE COMPLAINT IS THE WIPERS AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID DELIVERY IN BAD WEATHER WHEN IT IS ICY THEY FREEZE UP VERY EASILY AND DON T WORK MUCH WORSE THAN MY SEDAN NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS CAN SOMETIMES OBSTRUCT VISIBILITY
IT IS HARD TO SEE REAR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING UP
3RD ROW SEAT HEADRESTS BLOCK VISIBILITY SEVERELY
THERE IS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT IN THE RIGHT CORNER THAT STILL CAN BE IMPROVED IN MY OPINION
HEADLIGHTS WITH THE FOG LIGHTS ON TEND TO BE REALLY REALLY BRIGHT WHICH IS A GOOD THING THE WIPERS ON THE FRONT COULD BE BETTER SOMETIMES THEY MISS SMALL BITS OF DIRT
DUE TO CONFIGURATION OF REAR WINDOW AND SIDE PANELS THE REAL TIME REAR VIEW IS RESTRICTED AND YOU NEED TO RELY ON THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
I VE NOTICED LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS I CAN T SEE PAST THE SIDE MIRRORS SO IF THERE IS A CURB WHEN TURNING I MIGHT HIT IT BECAUSE I DIDN T SEE IT IN A PARKING LOT ONCE I DIDN T SEE A CAR COMING BECAUSE THE SIDE MIRROR BLOCKED MY VIEW MAYBE I AM SIT
MY ONLY ISSUE IS VISIBILITY ON PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES
FRONT HOOD IS TOO HIGH THAT SOMETIMES VISIBILITY BLOCKS
THE CAMERA IS INVALUABLE WHEN PARKING CAN T BE ANY BETTER
IF THE 3RD SEAT HEADRESTS ARE UP DRIVER VISIBILITY IS GREATLY REDUCED
BLIND SPOT IS HARDER TO TURN AND VIEW THAN OTHER VEHICLES I VE DRIVEN
I AM SHORT SO THE DRIVER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS MY VIEW I WISH IT WAS A LITTLE SMALL OR A LITTLE LOWER
POOR VISABILITY IF THE 3RD ROW HEAD RESTS ARE UPRIGHT
BLIND SPOTS IN CHANGING LANES ESPECIALLY DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY
SAFETY SYSTEMS WERE THE REASON I BOUGHT HE CAR
I LOVE HOW HIGH IT SITS AND THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE
ASSUMING AWD IS A SAFETY FEATURE THE INFINITI SYSTEM IS WONKY UNLESS I M DOING SOMETHING WRONG MY ALL WHEEL DRIVE DIDN T KICK IN UNTIL I WAS ALREADY IN A SLIDE ACCORDING TO THE SALES PERSON IT SHOULDN T HAVE EVEN GOTTEN TO THAT POINT
I LOVE THE REAR CAMERA AND PARKING SYSTEM
SIDE MIRROR WARNING LIGHTS LASER ARE OUTSTANDING AND SHOULD BE MANDATED SAFETY FEATURE ON ALL CARS
WISH THE BACK UP SCREEN HAD A SOUND TO INDICATE WHEN ONE IS TOO CLOSE
BIG BLIND SPOT RIGHT SIDE OF CAR
WHILE ON THE TELEPHONE NAVIGATION DOES NOT TALK MAYBE BECAUSE I M PAIRED WITH IPHONE MISSED EXIT
FEELING OF SAFETY WHEN DRIVING VEHICLE
SOMEWHAT OBSTRUCTED VIEW OF SIDE MIRRORS COMBINED WITH THE WIDE WINDOW BEAMS SECOND ROW MIDDLE HEADREST OBSTRUCTS REAR VIEW REAR WIPER SHOULD COVER LARGER PORTION OF WINDOW
REAR SPOILER REDUCES REAR VISION
BIG BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES WHEN CHANGING LANES THIS CAR IS MEANT TO HAVE THE TOP DOWN VISIBILITY IS VERY MARGINAL
I LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA IT SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL VEHICLES
TERRIBLE REAR BLIND SPOT
FRAMEWORK OBSTRUCT FORWARD VISABILITY WINDSHIELD NEEDS TO BE WIDER
SUN VISOR IS SO NARROW AND VANITY MIRROR ON IT IS SO SMALL THAT IT S ALMOST UNACCEPTABLE GIVEN THE SMALL MIRROR YOU COULD AT LEAST LIGHT IT UP SO WE CAN SEE SOMETHING HAHA THE VISIBILITY FOR DRIVER LOOKING STRAIGHT OUT IS GREAT BUT I CAN
FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT THE VISIBILITY WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN IS BLOCKED BY THE WIDTH OF THE ROOF SUPPORT AND THE LOCATION OF THE OUTSIDE LEFT REAR VIEW MIRROR I FEEL THIS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND AM CONSTANTLY AWARE OF THIS LOVE MY JEEP COMPASS
GREAT VISIBILITY IMPORTANT FEATURE TO ME FEMALE DRIVER
DRIVERS WINDSHIELD WIPER DOES NOT COVER THE BOTTOM 3 INCHES OF THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW NOT EVERYONE IS SIX FEET TALL IT IS ABSURD THAT THE SPEEDOMETER GOES TO 300 MPH THIS SCALE MAKES IT HARD TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN 40 AND 50 MPH PERHAPS A DIG
I REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND THE SOLID FEELING OF THE STEERING
VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE XF SAFETY FEATURES AND HOPE TO BE DRIVING IT FOR A VERY LONG TIME
SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS ON REAR QUARTERS
HEAD RESTS GREATLY RESTRICT REAR VISIBILITY WHEN ONE HAS TO PHYSICALLY TURN THE HEAD TO LOOK BEHIND THE VEHICLE
THE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE BETWEEN DRIVER AND REAR IT WOULD HELP IF ALL VEHICLES HAD INDICATORS OF VEHICLES BESIDE YOU
THE FRONT STRUCTURAL ROOF BARS THAT ARE ON EACH SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD CREATE AN UNUSAL BLIND SPOT AT STOP SIGNS MORE VISUAL CARE IS REQUIRED LOOKING TO THE FORWARD LEFT AND RIGHT AS PEOPLE AND CARS CROSSING IN FRONT CAN BE LOST OR BLOCKED
HEADLIGHT AUTOMATIC DIMMING AND FOLLOWING TURNS ARE OUTSTANDING SAFETY FEATURES
SIDE MIRRORS ARE VERY INEFFECTIVE LACK LANE VISIBILTY
THE LACK OF STANDARD BACK UP CAMERA IN THE JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE LAREDO IS DISAPPOINTING FRONT VEHICLE VISIBILITY FROM FORWARD SEATING IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED DUE TO THE SIZE AND LENGTH OF HOOD
THERE ARE LARGE BLIND SPOTS WHERE THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE
A NICE ADDITION WOULD BE CAMERA ACTIVATION TO SHOW AREA BESIDE VEHICLE WHEN TURN SIGNAL IS ACTIVATED
THE WINDSHIELD AND REAR VIEW MIRROR SOMETIMES BLOCK THE VIEW OF OTHER VEHICLES AND STOP LIGHTS
SIDE MIRRORS PROVIDE A LARGE BLIND SPOT
SIDE VISIBILITY DIFFICULT DUE TO FRONT POSTS
HEADS UP DISPLAY GREAT AID TO SAFE DRIVING
IN ADDITION TO THE BACK UP CAMERA HOW ABOUT A FRONT ONE FOR PARKING CAD HAD ONE 10 11 YEARS AGO THAT I GUESS NEVER TOOK OFF
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES BUT WITH BLIND SPOT WARNING I DON T WORRY ABOUT IT
IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHERE THE VEHICLE FRONT LEFT FRONT FENDER AND RIGHT FRONT FENDER IS LOCATED IN FACT IT CAUSED ME TO SCAPE THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER WITH THE SIDE OF MY GARAGE DOOR OPENING RESULTING IN $800 IN DAMAGE
THE HEADLIGHTS WOULD EVEN BE BETTER IF THEY HAD ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGY LIKE SOME CARS IN THIS CLASS AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY MY MODEL 3 8 DOES NOT HAVE THE OPTION FOR FOG LIGHTS IT ALLOWS FOR ALL WHEEL DRIVE BUT NOT FOG LIGHTS
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SHOULD BE UPGRADED THEY DO A POOR JOB IN MILD RAIN AND ARE BAD IN HEAVY RAIN
THERE IS A LITTLE SPOT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PASSENGER FRONT WINDOW THAT IS NOT CLEARED BY THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ANNOYING
I LOVE THE WARNINGS WHEN CARS ARE ALONG SIDE OF ME OR FOR BACKING UP BEST SAFETY FEATURE FOR ALL AROUND VISIBILITY IN ADDITION TO THE BACKUP CAMERA
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS BUT THE LANE CHANGE WARNING HELPS WITH THAT
SUN VISORS ARE AWESOME NICE TO BE ABLE TO USE I M SHORT WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE SMOOTH AND VISIBILITY IS AWESOME DURING THE RAINY SEASON
BETWEEN THE SAFETY FEATURES AND THE FEEL OF CONTROL CAR IS EXTREMELY SAFE TO DRIVE
AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS HAVE NO MANUAL INTERMITTENT SETTING IN LIGHT RAIN AND MIST THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS EITHER TOO FAST OR TOO SLOW A MANUAL INTERMITTENT SETTING WOULD BE PREFERRED THEY WORK FINE IN HEAVY RAIN
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WERE ACTUALLY A DISTANCE GAUGE FOR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
REALLY MISS NOT HAVING FOG LIGHTS FOR FOG CONDITIONS AND WHEN ON DARK COUNTRY ROADS TO HELP IDENTIFY THE LANES AND CONDITIONS TO THE SIDE OF VECHICLE
LEFT SIDE MIRROR BLOCKS VISIBILITY FOR MY WIFE WHEN SHE IS DRIVING PARTICULARLY WHEN TURNING LEFT
DIFFICULT TO SEE RIGHT BLIND SPOT
LIKE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM
I THINK THEY COULD HAVE DEFINITELY INSTALLED A REAR VIEW CAMERA ESPECIALLY ON THE ULTIMATE MODEL
WE CHECKED WITH OUR INSURANCE COMPANY BEFORE BUYING THIS VEHICLE AND DISCOVERED THAT OUR PREMIUM WOULD ACTUALLY BE LOWER THAN ON OUR OLDER SUV DUE TO THE HIGH SAFETY RATING
IT HAS BAD BLIND SPOTS
APPRECIATE THE REAR CAMERA
I LIKE THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS BLIND SPOT INDICATORS AND THE BACK UP CAMERA WARNINGS
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AUTOMATIC WIPERS WHEN IT FEELS MOISTURE ON THE WINDSHIELD
I M NOT TOO HAPPY THAT IT DIDNT COME WITH A REAR VIEW CAMERA VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE
I REALLY LIKE THE VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY FEATURES ESPECIALLY WHEN CHANGING LANES I AM EXTREMELY SHORT 4 11 SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME
BLIND SPOT OVER DOOR MIRRORS
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT AT THE RIGHT REAR OF THE CAR WHEN BACKING OUT OF AN ANGLED PARKING SPACE
SAFETY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WHEN DRIVING ANY VEHICLE THIS SONATA HAS ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURES AND MORE I FEEL VERY SECURE IN THIS CAR
LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY SHOULD CONSIDER ADDING REAR VIEW CAMERA
BLIND SPOT DETECTION OF COURSE HELPS WITH SIDE MIRRORS BUT STILL VISIBILITY IS GOOD REAR VISION CAN SEEM SMALL DUE TO THE WINDOW NOT BEING VERY BIG BUT MOST VEHICLES ARE LIKE THAT ANYMORE NOW THAT ARE COMPARABLE
LARGE BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE
BLIND SPOT WARNING HAS SAVED US FROM ACCIDENT SEVERAL TIMES
I DO NOTICE THAT THE FRONT CORNERS OF THE WINDSHEILD HAS A BLINDSPOT AS DOES THE REAR CORNERS OF THE BACK BUT SINCE I M AWARE OF THAT I KNOW HOW TO COMPENSATE
VISIBILITY THROUGH PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED AVOIDANCE SYSTEM HELPS TO COMPENSATE
THE DRIVER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS IN AN AWKWARD POSITION AND CAN AT TIMES MAKE LEFT HAND TURNS A LITTLE TOUGH TO MAKE SURE THERE ISN T A HAZARD
THE HYUNDAI FEELS SAFE AND STURDY BUT THE REAR VISIBILITY IS PRETTY SMALL AND I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE PARKING THE CAR IN A TIGHT PARKING SPACE THAT S WHY A REAR VIEW CAMERA IS NECESSARY
REAR LOOKING BLIND SPOTS GOING FORWARD ARE A NEGATIVE
VISIBILITY OUT SIDE WINDOWS IS AFFECTED AT TIMES BY THE SHAPE OF THE WINDOWS
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOT BAD FOR CHANGING LANES ON DRIVER SIDE
BLIND SPOT IMPROVED
FRONT VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT REAR VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY WHEN PARALLEL PARKING IS NOT SO GOOD I M OLD SCHOOL AND WOULD PREFER TO LOOK OUT THE BACK WINDOW WHEN PARKING RATHER THAN RELY ON VIDEO CAM AND LOOKING OUT THE BACK WINDOW ISN T EASY
I WISH IT HAD A NAVIGATION SYSTEM
A POSSIBLE LARGER SIDE MIRRORS WOULD ASSIST THE BLIND SPOTS TO THE REAR CHANGING LANES AND ASSISTING REAR VIEWS WHILE DRIVING
THE BLIND SPOT ON THE NEW EQUINOX SEEMS LIKE A LOT BIGGER THAN MY 06 I AM NOT SURE IF THE HEAD REST IS BIGGER OR IF THE REAR TRUNK WINDOWS ARE SMALLER OR IF THE GAP FROM THE FRONT DOORS TO THE BACK DOORS ARE WHAT BLOCKS THE VIEW BUT IF FEELS LIK
THE VISIBILITY FROM WITHIN THE VEHICLE ON ALL SIDES IS GREAT THE THE BARS AROUND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT HOWEVER SOMETIMES CAN BLOCK SEEING PEDESTRIANS OR BIKE RIDERS WOULD BE NICE IF THEY WERE NARROWER
MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY THAN THE SILVERADO I USED TO HAVE
SOMETIMES THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SMUDGE THE WINDOW AND DON T WORK SO GREAT
NEEDS BLIND SPOT MIRRORS OR REDESIGN TO REDUCE BLIND SPOTS
I CANNOT RELY ON THE USE OF THE MIRRORS THE BLIND SPOT IS QUITE ACUTE AND I WOULD HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF NEAR MISSES IF I HAD NOT LOOKED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER
SEEMS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE
VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS PRETTY RESTRICTED THANK GOODNESS FOR THE BACKUP CAMERA BEST HEADLIGHTS I VE EVER HAD IN A CAR SMOOTH AND BRIGHT
I DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE CHANGING LANES SO I INSTALLED SOME CONVEX MIRRORS THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS HAMPERED BY THE POST BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR WINDOWS THE REAR WINDOW SEEMS SMALL
REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE
REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS LIMITED BUT WITH THE ELECTRONIC ASSIST FEATURES IT IS ACCEPTABLE BUT REQUIRES SOME GETTING USE TO I DISLIKE HAVING TO DEPEND ON ELECTRONICS HOWEVER DON T KNOW WHY HEADRESTS HAVE TO BE AS BIG AS THEY ARE
LARGE BLIND SPOTS FROM PASSENGER HEADREST AND DOOR POSTS
VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW IS VERY POOR ALSO THE HEADRESTS MAKE SIDE VISIBILITY DIFFICULT
DRIVES GREAT WITH EXCELLENT VISIBILITY
THE HEADLIGHTS AND BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE AMAZING
REAR DECK SEEMS TO SHRINK THE REAR VIEW WITH THE MIRROR
POOR REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY
SEEMS TO BE A LARGE BLIND SPOT ON EACH SIDE WHEN LOOKING BACK FROM DRIVERS SEAT
BACKUP CAMERA SHOULD HAVE BEEN STANDARD ON THIS CLASS OF CAR DISAPOINTED IT WAS A FACTORY ORDER ITEM AS PART OF A PACKAGE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A STANDALONE ADD ITEM AT LEAST BUT AS SAY REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN STANDARD LIKE HONDA
THE LANE DEPARTURE AND BLIND SPOT COLLISION AVOIDANCE ARE INCREDIBLE I DON T KNOW HOW THE US AUTO INDUSTRY HADN T COME UP WITH THOSE GREAT SYSTEMS YEARS AGO
BLIND SPOTS VISUALLY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT WHEN CARS COMING UP ON LEFT SIDE BUT BLIND SPOT WARNING TAKES CARE OF THIS
BLIND SPOTS ON REAR AND BACK SIDES
LIKE COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM VERY MUCH
I APPRECIATE THE SAFETY FEATURES SUCH AS LANE CHANGE VEHICLES ALONGSIDE TOO CLOSE A VOICE WARNING OF APPROACHING PROBLEMS BACK UP PICTURES
BECAUSE OF MY HEIGHT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW EVEN WHEN SITTING ON PILLOWS HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT TAKE AWAY ANY OF THE OTHER SAFETY FEATURES THE IMPALA HAS I VE ADJUSTED MY SEAT AND USE MY PILLOWS TO GET AROUND NOT ABLE T
THE BACK UP CAMERA AND SCREEN ARE MUCH CLEARER AND LARGER THAN IN MANY OTHER VEHICLES I TEST DROVE WHICH AGAIN MAKE THE VEHICLE FEEL HIGH END
OTHER THAN THE VISIBILITY BEING OBSCURED WHEN LOOKING RIGHT AT TIMES DURING CERTAIN SITUATIONS THE VISIBILITY IS REALLY GOOD
INITIALLY I DIDN T WANT THE ADDITIONAL SAFETY PACKAGE I M SO GLAD I GOT IT
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER S SIDE WHEN LOOKING OUT THE SIDE WINDOW
THE ONLY VISIBILITY CONCERN IS LOOKING BACK OUT OF REAR VIEW MIRROR
I REALLY LOVE DRIVING THE CAR BUT WISH THE DRIVER SEAT RAISED SLIGHTLY HIGHER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY OVER THE SIDE MIRRORS
THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS VERY HELPFUL AND SHOULD BE ON EVERY CAR
I NOTICE THAT EVERY CAR I DRIVE OR RIDE IN BASE BLIND SPOTS WERE MY OLD CARES DO NOT I HATE THAT
REAR HEADRESTS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE LOWERED TO INCREASE REARWARD VISIBILITY
THE SAFETY FEATURES IN MY IMPALA SHOULD BE STANDARD IN ALL NEW CHEVROLET VEHICLES
A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS REDUCED BY NOT HAVING THE SMALL CONVEX MIRRORS AS PART OF THE SIDE MIRRORS
ALMOST NO BLIND SPOTS BETWEEN WINDOW VISIBILITY AND MIRRORS
THE VISORS COULD BE REDESIGNED TO COVER THE BLIND SPOT BY THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
WHILE DRIVING THERE IS A TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT LOOKING OUT THE PASSENGER REAR WINDOW I HAVE ALMOST BEEN IN NUMEROUS ACCIDENTS BECAUSE I CAN T SEE OUT OF THE REAR PASSENGER CORNER THIS IS PROBABLY MY ONLY REAL COMPLAINT AND IT EXISTED IN THE 201
HARD TO SEE WHEN PULLING OUT INTO TRAFFIC LARGE BLIND SPOT BECAUSE OF AIRBAGS IN THE PILLARS
REAR VIEW MIRROR COULD BE BIGGER HARD TO SEE TO LEFT WHEN CHANGING LANES FROM WINDOW
BLIND SPOT WHEN OTHER VEHICLEPASSING
I LIKE ALL THE AIRBAGS
VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK IS A BIT CHALLENGING
REAR DECK IS TO HIGH FOR GOOD REAR VISIBILITY HEAD RESTS RESTRICT SIDE VISIBILITY
VERY LARGE BLIND SPOTS HAD TO ADJUST MIRRORS DIFFERENTLY AND GET USED TO NEW POSITIONING FOR LANE CHANGES
BLIND SPOT IS BAD AT TIMES
MODELS WITHOUT BLIND SPOT MONITORING SHOULD HAVE A MIRROR WITHIN A MIRROR FOR THE SIDE MIRRORS TO IMPROVE BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY OFFERING THIS AS AN ACCESSORY WOULD BE A GOOD SECOND OPTION
I M 6 4 AND LIKE MOST VEHICLES THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SOMETIMES IS A BLIND SPOT
TRAILER TOW MIRRORS ARE NICE LOOKING BUT NEED TO BE LOWERED OR RE DESIGNED
HOOD ELEVATION RELATIVE TO DRIVING POSITION FOR SOMEONE 6 1 SEEMS UNECESSARY
ROOF LIGHTS MAKE IT EASY TO SEE ME COMING LARGE BACKUP CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL
JUST DIFFICULT TO SEE BLIND SPOTS AT INTERSECTIONS WITH LARGER TOWING MIRRORS
DIFFICULT TO SEE IN REAR WHEN BACKING UP BECAUSE OF ELEVATED REAR END BACK UP CAMERA HELPS A LOT
THE VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS OR OTHERWISE USING SIDEVISION IS NOT VERY EASY THERE SEEM TO BE BLIND SPOTS THE WINDSHIELD AND DOOR POSTS MAKE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS OVERALL I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THE VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE
I DO LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR
ASIDE FROM AFORE MENTIONED THINGS I WOULD PREFER THE HOOD BE SLOPED MORE DOWNWARD FROM THE WINDSHIELD TO THE FRONT OF THE FRONT OF THE HOOD WHICH WOULD PROVIDE BETTER VISIBILITY WHEN PARKING TO REPEAT I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE ROOM BEHIND THE S
I M GLAD THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS ARE THE SMALL SIZE THEY ARE GOT RID OF A BIG BLIND SPOT COMPARED TO MY RAM
BLINDS SPOTS TO SIDES AND BLIND SPOT BEHIND LARGE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS NOT THAT THIS IS A FLAW BUT IT JUST TAKES GETTING USE TO IT
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT AND YOU CAN T SEE WHEN LOOKING OVER YOUR LEFT SHOULDER BECAUSE THE DOOR POST IS WIDE I WISH THIS CAR DID HAVE THE LANE CHANGE WARNING FEATURE I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE BACK TOO
THERE ARE BAD BLIND SPOTS ON REAR SIDES OF THE CAR
I WISH I WERE ABLE TO FOLD DOWN THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS WHEN NO ONE IS IN THE BACK SEAT WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN REARWARD VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGE I D LIKE TO SEE LOWER PROFILE HEADRESTS ON THE REAR SEATING SO I COULD SEE BETTER OUT THE REAR WINDOW WE ONLY RIDE KIDS IN THE BACK SEAT AND THEY DON T USE THE HEADRESTS
I WISHED THEY OFFERED BLIND SIDE MONITORING ALERTS
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THAN IN MY CLASSIC
HAS A BIG BLIND SPOT IN THE BACK REAR WHEN YOU ARE BACKING OUT OF PLACES
THE WINDOWS AND PANELS ARE WELL POSITIONED TO HAVETHEMOST VISIBILTY POSSIBLE I ENJOY HOW SAFE I FEEL WHILE DRIVING
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS TOO SMALL HAD TO ADD SPOT MIRROR FOR BLIND SPOT
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE A REAR BACK UP CAMERA MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE ONE
CAR FEELS SAFE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL THOUGH
WHEN CHANGING LANES BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT HAND SIDE MAKES IT HARD TOSEE A CAR COMING
SERIOUS BLIND SPOT
WITH A SMALL REAR WINDOW THEY SHOULD MAKE A REAR VIEW CAMERA STANDARD ON ALL OF THEIR VEHICLES ALSO THE MIRROR SHOULD COME WITH BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ADDED IN
ONCE AGAIN TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS
SUN VISORS DON T COME DOWN FAR ENOUGH WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A 1 2 MOVEABLE EXTENDER RIGHT REAR HEADREST OBSTRUCTS VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES
REAR WIPERS DON T MOVE VERY SMOOTHLY
VISIBILITY FOR REAR PASSENGER SIDE WIDOWS COULD BE IMPROVED
THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT BETWEEN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND THE SIDE WINDOWS
IN SPITE OF BLIND SPOT WARNING ETC THE BLIND SPOTS ITSELF ON THE LEFT SIDE IS TOO BIG FOR THE DRIVER IT THE TAHOE IS NOT TOWING TRAILERS ALL THE TIME THEN THE SHOCKS ARE TOO STIFF FOR DAILY DRIVE OTHER THAN TYNE FEELING OF RIDING IN A TRUCK IT
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
WHEN THE THIRD ROW SEATS ARE IN PLACE THE REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR
THE REAR SEAT DVD PLAYER SHOULD NOT BE MOUNTED IN THE CENTER OF THE VEHICLE WHEN IN USE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS RENDERED INEFFECTIVE I REALIZED THAT THE ONLY OPTION TO FIX THIS IS TO MOUNT TWO SCREENS DIRECTLY BEHIND EACH OF THE FRONT SEAT A
SIDE MIRRORS AND REAR WINDOW ARE TO SMALL NEW SAFETY DEVICES ARE NICE BUT REAL TIME VISIBILITY IS BETTER
I DO LIKE THE WARNING SYSTEM ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS TELLING OF BLIND SIDE VEHICLES APPROACHING
OUR TRAVERSE HAD FACTORY INSTALLED BLIND SPOT MIRRORS AND THIS DOES NOT WHICH CAUSES THIS VEHICLE TO HAVE VERY BAD BLIND SPOTS
HAVEN T YET BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE FEEL LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING I CAN T SEE DID NOT FEEL THIS WAY IN THE ACADIA I THINK THAT THE REAR CAMERA IN THE CHEVROLET IS LESS CLEAR
EVEN MY HAD SMALL AUXILIARY SIDE MIRRORS T0 SEE THE BLIND SPOT INEXCUSABLE TO OMIT SUCH A LOW COST AND IMPORTANT ITEM ON A VEHICLE ESPECIALLY ON ONE OF THIS PRICE VERY DISAPPOINTING
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS ON THE FRONT WINDOW AREA
IT COULD USE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM THE REARVIEW CAMERA AND BACKUP WARNING IS NICE
SIDE DOOR MIRROS ARE A TOO SMALL TO ALLOW GOOD VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES
FOR THE COST OF THE VEHICLE THERE SHOULD BE THE WARNING LIGHTS ON THE SIDE MIRRORS FOR PASSING CARS
LARGE BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE FROM THE REAR OF THE SECOND DOOR TO THE EDGE OF THE DRIVERS SEAT
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS IN THAT CAR
THE REAR VISIBILITY AND BLIND SPOTS ARE NOTTGREAT
LARGE BLIND SPOT TO ADJUST TO
THE CAR FEELS VERY SAFE AND SOLID TO DRIVE WITH GREAT SAFETY FEATURES
THE FRONT VISIBILITY IS LATERALLY IMPEDED BY THE PILLARS BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE FRONT DOORS THE PILLARS ARE TOO WIDE
I LIKE THE OPTIONAL ADDITIONAL AIRBAGS
THE THICKNESS AND LOCATION OF THE FRONT PILLARS IS A SAFETY HAZARD SEVERAL TIMES I HAVE NEARLY PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF A CAR COMING FROM THE RIGHT WHEN AT A STOP SIGN THE FRONT RIGHT PILLAR CAN COMPLETELY BLOCK THE DRIVER FROM SEEING A CAR COMI
LITTLE MORE BLIND SPOTS MAYBE DUE TO SMALLER MIRRORS
MIRRORS NEED TO BE MORE ADJUSTABLE I CAN T RAISE THEM HIGH ENOUGH TO SEE MY BLIND SPOT SINCE I AM 6 5
PASSENGER OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR DOES NOT COVER ENOUGH AREA
I LOVE THE 4 WHEEL DRIVE DURING SNOWY WEATHER FEEL SAFE BY SIZE AND HIGHER DRIVING POSITION
REALLY GOOD VISIBILITY ALL AROUND
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT LOOKING BACK WHEN TRYING TO MERGE BEHIND THE DOOR WINDOWS
FOR THE PRICE WOULD LIKE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR
WOULD LIKE BLIND SPOT FEATURE
THE REAR CONVERTIBLE WINDOW IS TOO SMALL WHICH MAKES TERRIBLE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW WHEN THE TOP IS UP
NOT AS GOOD OF VISIBILITY TO THE REAR AS MY CORVETTE Z51 BUT I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS DRIVING SO FAR
WISH IT HAD BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND 360 DEGREE BACK UP CAMERA
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BLIND SPOT MONITORING ADDED TO THE SAFETY PACKAGE THAT NOW INCLUDES FORWARD COLLISION WARNING AND LANE DEPARTURE WARNING
CORVETTE CONVERTIBLE WITH TOP UP IN PLACE HAS LIMITED SIDE AND REAR VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL
NEEDS ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE FEATURE EITHER STANDARD OR AS AN OPTION ALSO NEEDS FRONT CAMERA SIMILAR TO REAR CAMERA WHICH IS GOOD
CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE GOOD VISIBILITY WITH THE TOP DOWN
SMALL BLIND SPOT BEHIND DRIVER IN MY CONVERTIBLE VET
WOULD BENEFIT FROM BLIND SPOT SENSORS AND PARK DISTANCE CONTROLS
A COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM WOULD BE A GOOD ADDITION
BLIND SPOTS EXIST WHEN CHANGING LANES
HEAD LIGHT BEAM IS TOO NARROW NO SHOULDER ILLUMINATION SLOW SPEED TURNING VISIBILITY POOR
MINE IS A CONVERTIBLE AND REAR VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR DOWN LOW WHERE A CAR FOLOWING YOU WOULD BE SEAT DOES NOT ADJUST UP IN HEIGHT ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE STRAIGHT BACK I AM 5 8
BLIND SIDE MONITORS WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION
WE DON T TAKE IT OUT IN THE RAIN SO THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS HAVE NOT BEEN USED
THE ONLY VISIBILITY ISSUE I HAVE IS SEEING THE DISTANCE IN FRONT AND BEHIND ME WHILE PARKING
BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVERS SEAT
SMALL CONVEX MIRROR IN CORNER OF DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER OR SOME HOW ADJUSTABLE
THE REAR CAMERA IS GREAT AND THE LANE CHANGE SIGNALS ARE VALUABLE FEATURES
I WISH ALL VEHICLES HAD MANDATORY BACK UP CAMERAS
REAR WINDOW WITH REAR DVD SYSTEM
FORWARD VISIBILITY IS FINE BUT THE VISIBILITY TO THE SIDES SUFFERS DUE TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE WINDSHIELD POSTS THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR POST BETWEEN THE FRONT SEAT AND THE BACK SEAT TENDS TO BLOCK VISIBILITY TO CARS COMING FROM THE LEFT ESPECIALLY
I DON T LIKE THE HIGHT OF THE TRUNK AS VISIBILITY IS HINDERED BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT IS THE CASE FOR MOST OF THE NEW CARS
HARD TO SEE WHEN BACKING UP AS FAR AS SEEING ALL AROUND SEEMS LIKE THERE S A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS BACKING UP
THE BRACKET THAT HOLDS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A DISTRACTION TO ME
I WOULD HAVE GLADLY PAID FOR AN HID OPTION FOR HEADLIGHTS
BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE SIDE MIRRORS NEED THE WARNING DISPLAYS LANE CHANGING CAR IN THE BLIND SPOT
ESPECIALLY LIKE REAR VIEW CAMERA WITH LINES THAT BEND WHEN BACKING INTO PARKING SPACE
NEEDS RAIN SENSOR WIPERS LIKE MY LANDROVER
THIS VEHICLE HAS A TERRIBLY DANGEROUS BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER SIDE IT NEEDS TO HAVE BLIND SIDE DETECTION OR SOME SORT OF CONVEX MIRROR TO SEE CARS ON THE DRIVER SIDE
REAR WINDOW IS DIFFICULT YO SEE OUT OF COMPLETELY RELY ON BACK UP CAMERA WHICH IS VERY GOOD THOUGH ALSO TRYING TO SEE OUT PASSENGER SIDE BEHIND THE SEAT WHEN THE INTERSECTION IS AT AN ANGLE GREATER THAN 90 DEGREES IS VERY DIFFICULT FIND M
HAS BLIND SPOTS
THE ONLY CONCERN IS SITTING AT A STOP SIGN THERE MAY BE SMALL AREA OF A BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO LOOK LEFT AND RIGHT
THE LARGE TRUNK SEEMS TO CUT OFF SOME VISIBILITY I TRADED A DODGE AVENGER FOR THIS CHRYSLER AND THAT WAS VERY NOTICEABLE WHEN I FIRST DROVE THE CHRYSLER
THE FRAME AROUND THE WINDSHIELD IS A BIT WIDE MAKING FRONT END VISIBILITY LESS THAN PERFECT
I WISH THAT I BOUGHT ONE WITH THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA WAS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE WHERE THE REAR BUMPER ENDED WHEN BACKING UP
THE RIGHT SIDE FORWARD BLIND SPOT CAUSED BY THE ROOF SUPPORT IS LARGER THAN I ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED
BESURE TO ADJUST REAR VIEW SIDE MIRRORS BEFORE DRIVING AWAY VEHICLE HAS A DEADSPACE TOWARD THE LEFT AND RIGHT PASSENGER REAR PANEL REAR DOORS AND BACK WINDSHIELD
SAFETY FEATURES ARE OUTSTANDING WISH I HAD THE FULL SAFETY PACKAGE
BACK UP CAMERA TAKES GETTING USED TO BUT MAYBE NOT SUCH A GOOD THING LOOKING BEHIND SHOULD ALWAYS BE FIRST INSTINCT
ONE SMALL THING IS A SIDE EFFECT OF A GOOD THING THE WINDSHIELD IS HUGE WITH GREAT VISIBILITY BUT THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS THEN NEED TO GO ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE END OF THE GLASS WE LIVE IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE UNITED STATES AND WHEN THE SNOW 
PROBLEM WITH BLIND SPOTS LEFT AND RIGHT LARGER MIRRORS WOULD HELP
I REALLY LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERAS HELP ME SEE WHAT S BEHIND ME
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS FROM DRIVER SEAT HARD TO SEE CARS THAT ARE NEXT TO YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY TURN HEAD TO MAKE SURE
LOT OF BLIND SPOTS SIDE MIRRORS BLOCK VISIBILITY AND FRONT PANEL BY THE WINDSHIELD
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE BETTER DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE HEADLIGHT BLINDING FROM SURROUNDING VEHICLES LIKE YOUR REAR VIEW MIRROR DOES
REALLY LIKE THIS VEHICLE AND SAFETY FEATURES COMFORT THIS IS THE 4TH TOWN AND COUNTRY WE HAVE OWNED
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AROUND AND IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE
THE DROP DOWN SCREEN AS WELL AS THE HEIGHT OF THE 3RD ROW HEADRESTS WHEN UP OBSTRUCT THE REAR VISIBILITY
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS A REAL PLUS
NOTICEABLE BLINDSPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE FOR CHANGING LANES TO THE LEFT
THIS VEHICLE STANDS OUT IN TERMS OF REARWARD VISIBILITY WHILE BACKING AND PARKING MOST OTHER VEHICLES WE TESTED FROM THE CURRENT AND RECENT MODEL YEARS WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF WHEN LOOKING REARWARD FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
EVEN THOUGH THE VAN IS A LARGER VEHICLE THERE ARE FEWER BLIND SPOTS THAN MANY OF TODAYS SEDANS
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT WHEN THE THIRD ROW HEAD RESTS ARE DEPLOYED IS RESTRICTED
INTERIOR REAR SEAT MIRROR IS TOO CONVEX CAN SUPPLEMENT INTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR OR MAKE INTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR SLIGHTLY CONVEX EXCESSIVE VEHICLE LENGTH MAKES KNOW WHERE THE REAR WHEEL & CORNERS OF THE VEHICLE ARE DIFFICULT TO GAUGE EASILY
HEADRESTS INTERFERE WITH REAR VISIBILITY
PUT BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON VANS AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT
VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING OVER LEFT SHOULDER
POOR VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES AND BACKING UP
ITS HARD TO SEE OUT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN THE TV SCREEN IS DOWN
IT DOES HAVE A BLIND SPOT WHERE THE PASSENGER SEAT BLOCKS THE SMALL BACKSEAT WINDOW
VERY RELIANT ON THE CAMERA AND SIDE MIRRORS DIFFICULT ADJUSTING TO THE SMALL SIZE OF SIDE BACK WINDOWS
I M GLAD I HAVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA BECAUSE WITHOUT IT THERE IS ALMOST NO VISION TO THE REAR
THE VISIBILITY IS FINE AND THE SIDE RADAR DETECTOR IS AWESOME
I FEEL AS IF MOST CARS TODAY HAVE MORE BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING TO CHANGE LANES OR LOOKING TO BACK UP IT IS NOT JUST THE MODEL CAR I OWN BUT ALL THAT I CHECKED BEFORE BUYING MY CAR I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BLIND SPOT CAMERA S OR INDICATORS PLACED IN
NOT TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS
HELL OF A BLIND SPOT BACKING OUT OF A DRIVEWAY BUT IF IT MEANS CHANGING THE STYLING I D RATHER GET HIT
WITHOUT THE MIRROR INDICATORS OF CARS IN MY BLIND SPOT S I WONDER IF I MAY NOT HAVE HIT SOME CARS
THE LIMITED VISIBILITY IS A RESULT OF THE EXTERIOR STYLING OF THE VEHICLE TO IMPROVE THE VISIBILITY YOU WOULD RUIN THE LINES OF THE VEHICLE YOU CAN T HAVE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME DODGE GOT THE STYLING VISIBILITY TRADEOFF JUST RIGHT WITH THE CH
WITHOUT A REARVIEW CAMERA IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BACKUP IN PARKING SPACES ACCURATELY AND SAFELY
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS I UNDERSTAND ITS A BIG BODY JUST WISHED THERE WERE SIDE MIRROR CAMERAS FOR BLINDSPOTS OR SOMETHING
VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS IMPEDED BY THE DVD PLAYER AND BACK SET HEAD RESTS
MINI VANS ALWAYS SEEM TO HAVE BLIND SPOTS
THE RETRO DESIGN HAS ITS VISIBILITY LIMITATIONS BUILT IN BUT I BOUGHT THE CAR KNOWING THAT AND FIND IT TERRIFIC TO DRIVE
THE CHALLENGER HAS PRETTY BIG BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES DEPENDING ON THE SEAT LOCATION OF THE PASSENGER SEAT THE SMALL SIDE WINDOW MAY BE BLOCKED CREATING A LARGE BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE
BLIND SPOTS CAN BE LARGE AND IT TOOK A WHILE TO FIND MY SWEET SPOT IN THE SEAT ADJUSTMENT BUT NOW I FOUND IT THE CAR IS A DREAM FOR FORWARD AND REARWARD VISIBILITY AND WITH A TURN OF THE HEAD NO MAJOR BLIND SPOTS
I HAVE HAD A FEW INSTANCES WHEN COASTING OVER TO THE LEFT LANE THAT ANOTHER VEHICLE WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN IN MY BLIND SPOT
SAFETY FEATURES MAKE YOU FEEL SAFE SLIGHT BLIND SPOT BUT HAVE THE SYSTEM FOR THAT REALLY DO NOT NEED A HUGE REAR WINDOW HEAD LIGHTS AND VISION GREAT
MY CAR HAS THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM IF THIS IS NOT STANDARD EQUIPMENT IT SHOULD BE AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT IS NEXT TO YOU IN EITHER LANE BEHIND THE FRONT DOOR GLASS I WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE THE STYLING CHANGED TO MAKE THIS BETTER
THE CAR OFFERS GREAT VISIBILITY AND FEELS VERY SOLID AND SAFE
HAS MULTIPLE BLIND SPOTS
THE VISIBILITY TO THE SIDES AND REAR MUST BE IMPROVED THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS A START BUT NOT THE SOLUTION WHEN YOU BACK UP YOU CAN SEE THE IMMEDIATE REAR OF YOUR VEHICLE HOWEVER THE 45 DEGREE ANGLES TO THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE ARE BLIND T
HID LIGHTS MAKE SEEING EASY
REAR WIPERS WOULD BE GOOD BOXY BEHIND REAR VIEW MIRROR TAKES UP VALUABLE WINDSHIELD SPACE
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY APPARENT WITH THIS VEHICLE BUT THEY ARE NOT REALLY A PROBLEM WITH THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR SYSTEM
FACTORY WIPER BLADES WERE CHEAP AND DIDN T CLEAR WINDOWS VERY WELL
REAR CAMERA IS NICE AN SHOULD REPLACE MIRROW PERMENALTY
DOES NOT HAVE A BLIND SPOT
I DO FEEL THAT THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES AND USUALLY LOOK OUT MY WINDOW WHEN TO MAKE SURE I DON T COLLIDE
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS ON EACH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE JUST TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT OF EACH QUARTER PANEL MUST TAKE CARE TO INSPECT THOSE SPOTS PRIOR TO CHANGING LANES
BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGER THAT WHAT I M ACCUSTOMED TO GETTING USED TO RELYING ON BLIND SPOT DETECTION WARNING LIGHTS
BLIND SIDE INDICATORS ARE WONDERFUL
VISIBILITY TO REAR QUARTERS COULD BE BETTER
DODGE DID A GOOD JOB OF MIRROR SIZE FOR THEIR VEHICLE ALLOWING YOU TO ELIMINATE BLINDSPOTS WITH PROPERLY ADJUSTED MIRRORS THE AUTO DIMMING FEATURE IS ALSO GREAT AT NIGHT WHEN YOU RE BEING FOLLOWED BY SOMEONE WITH THEIR BRIGHTS ON OR A LARGE TRUC
LITTLE BIT OF A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER THE DASH TO THE LEFT SIDE NEAR THE A POST OTHER THAN THAT VISIBILITY IS GOOD
BACKUP CAMERA WITH THE RADAR PARK ASSIST IS AWESOME MY LAST VEHICLE I HAD THE REAR BUMPER REPLACED ONCE AND PAINTED 3 OR 4 TIMES IF I BACK INTO ANTHING WITH THIS CAR I SHOULD HAVE MY LISCENCE PULLED HID HEADLIGHTS ARE SOMETHING ID NEVER WANT T
IT COULD PRACTICALLY DRIVE ITSELF I AM STILL DISCOVERING SAFETY FEATURES IN MY CAR
IMPROVEMENTS WITH THE BLIND SPOT HAVE WORKED WHEN I DROVE A CHARGER WHEN THEY CAME BACK OUT THE BLIND SPOTS WERE HORRIFIC MUCH MUCH BETTER OUTSTANDING HEADLIGHTS
THE TILTING SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AND THE BACK UP CAMERA WITH PROXIMITY SENSOR ARE NICE THE OVERALL VIEW FROM INSIDE THE CAR TO THE OUTSIDE IS SURPRISINGLY EXCELLENT SPITE THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE
I LOVE THE SAFETY FEATURES THE REAR CAMERA IS AWESOME
BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE BACKUP CAMERA INCREASE THE VISIBILITY WHICH ADDS MORE SAFETY
IT HAS PERFECT VISIBILITY WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE GREATEST ASPECT DUE TO SAFETY WHILE DRIVING
EXCELLENT REAR VIEW SCREEN WHEN BACKING UP
I LOVE MY NEW CAR THE ONLY THING I HAVE NOTICED IS THE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT OUT OF THE FRONT WINDOW LOOKING RIGHT AND LEFT
I USED TO HAVE A ACADIA AND I NEVER FELT LIKE IT HAS AS BAD OF A REAR SIDE BLIND SPOT AS THE DURANGO HAS IT HAS TAKEN SOME GETTING USED TO
IT REALLY HAS A BIG BLIND SPOT YOU HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR
DON T KNOW ABOUT REAR SEAT VISIBILITY AS I DRIVE THE VEHICLE
THE FRONT DOOR PANEL SOMETIMES GETS IN THE WAY OF VISABILITY
AUTOMATIC WIPERS
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT
ALTHOUGH REAR AND SIDE VISABILITY IS BELOW AVERAGE IT CAN BE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED BY LOWERING 3RD ROW HEADRESTS AND STRATIGIC USE OF REARVIEW MIRRORS
HEADLIGHTS ARE AMAZING AT NIGHT REALLY LIKE THE AUTOMATIC HIGHT BEAM NEVER REALISED WHAT I WAS MISSING WITH NIGHT TIME DRIVING ESPECIALLY ROAD VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO MANAGE WITHOUT PRACTICE
OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE SMALL WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER CARS
HID HEADLIGHTS WORK GREAT
MENTIONED BEFORE THE REAR HEADRESTS DO CAUSE A VISIBILITY ISSUE IT IS THE HEIGHT AND THE SHAPE OF THE HEADREST
THERE ARE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS IN THE VEHICLE FRONT WINDOW HAS THESE ON BOTH SIDES WHERE THE WINDOW ENDS I BELIEVE THIS TO BE TRUE OF MOST VEHICLES
I HAD TO INSTALL AFTERMARKET CONVEX MIRRORS TO OVERCOME DESIGN DEFICIENCIES OF FACTORY MIRRORS
BLIND SPOT BLIND SPOT BLIND SPOT
THE VISIBILITY OF THE DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT WHENEVER I AM CHANGING LANES ON THE DRIVER SIDE THERE IS A HORRIBLE BLIND SPOT
NEED PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT MIRROR
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN YOU TURN AROUND AND BACK UP IT S BETWEEN THE BACK DOOR AND REAR OF VEHICLE LUCKILY WE HAVE A REAR VIEW CAMERA
NEEDS BETTER REAR VISBILITY AND BRIGHTER HEADLIGHTS
THE SIDE POSTS ARE VERY WIDE AND SOMETIMES CREATES A BLIND SPOT WHEN PULLING OUT AT INTERSECTIONS
LOVE THE REAR VIDEO MONITOR STILL GETTING USED TO SOME OF THE BLIND SPOTS
THE SPLIT BACK WINDOW IS NOT EASY TO SEE OUT OF ESPECIALLY THE LOWER HALF THAT GETS DIRTY QUICKLY LOWERING VISIBILITY
GIVEN THE POOR VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR TO THE SIDES THE MIRRORS SHOULD OFFER A WIDER RANGE OR SIDE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SHOULD BE OFFERED AND I DO PROPERLY SET MY MIRRORS AS MANUFACTURERS SUGGEST
I AM SHORT AND THE SUN VISOR DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK FOR ME ALSO I DO NOT LIKE THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THERE ARE TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS DO NOT LIKE THE DESIGN OF THE SIDE MIRRORS NOT EFFECTIVE FOR ME
FEELS AS IF THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
DEFINITE BLIND SPOT BEHIND THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT DIFFICULT TO SEE CAR AT THAT POINT THE STANDARD WIPERS ARE NOT PERFECT THE WIPERS DO NOT CLEAR VISIBILITY AS WELL AS EXPECTED LEAVES LIGHT LAYER SMEAR OF WATER
WISH SOMETHING COULD BE DONE TO IMPROVE REAR VISIBILITY SUCH AS REMOVING REAR HEADRESTS OR ENLARGING REAR WINDOW
BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS NEEDED AND SHOULD BE STD
WITH THE BACKUP CAMERA VISIBILITY IS GREAT
GOOD THING THE BACK UP CAMERA IS THERE BECAUSE I CANT SEE TO BACK UP THE SEATS THE REAR WINDOW TOO SMALL IF CAMERA BREAKS ILL HAVE TO GO FORWARD AT ALL TIMES
SINCE THERE IS A VISIBILITY PROBLEM WITH MIRRORS IT WOULD BE AWESOME IF IT HAD LANE DEPARTURE TECH INCLUDED
ALMOST NO BLIND SPOT EXCELLENT VISIBILITY
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES WHEN LOOKING OUT SIDE WINDOWS
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A REAR WIPER ESPECIALLY FOR MORNINGS WHEN THERE IS DO ON THE CAR I CURRENTLY HAVE TO SQUEEGE IT OFF EACH MORNING A WIPER WOULD BE NICE AND MAKE IT SAFER ALSO LOWERING THE WINDOWS DOES NOT REMOVE THE DO EITHER IT SH
DOOR WINDSHIELD POSTS SEAM LARGER THAN USUAL CAUSES SOME SIDE VISABILITY PROBLEMS
REAR VIEW CAMERA WOULD BE NICE
REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY FOR DRIVER IS POOR
KIND OF A BLIND SPOT ON THE REAR CORNER ON THE PASSENGER SIDE
WOULD BE HELPFUL HAVING A REAR WINDOW WINDSHIELD WIPER
POOR VISION LOOKING LEFT AND RIGHT WHEN DRIVING WISH CAR HAD A REAR WINDOW WIPER
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS SPLIT BY THE HATCH SYSTEM AND MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE HOWEVER SETTING THE REARVIEW MIRROR CORRECTLY AND FAMILIARITY WITH THE CAR MAKES THIS A MINOR PROBLEM FOR SAFE DRIVING
REAR AND FRONT VISIBILITY GREATLY REDUCED BY THE WIDE PILLARS
THE VISORS SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO SLIDE HORIZONTALLY TO PREVENT SUN FROM DISTRACTING AND OBSTRUCTING VIEW WE ARE QUITE SHOCKED THAT IN A VEHICLE FROM CHEVROLET THAT THIS FEATURE IS NOT HERE ****IT ACTUALLY IS A SAFETY FEATURE THAT SH
BLIND SPOTS ARE TOO BIG AND WINDOW PILLARS ARE TOO WIDE
REAR WINDOW TOO HIGH DIFFICULTY WITH VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT
FOR A SMALL CAR FEELS MUCH BIGGER AND HIGHER UP WHICH PROVIDES GREATER FORWARD VISIBILITY
THE SHAPE OF THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE BAD THE WHOLE MIRROR SHOULD BE RECTANGLE THE WAY THE OUTSIDE CORNER DROPS DOWN CUTS OFF PART OF THE VIEW THAT IS NEEDED
THE HEADRESTS ON THE REAR SEATS IMPEDE REAR VISIBILITY
THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE PASSENGER WINDOW IS NOT VERY GOOD THE SEATBELT SUPPORT OR WHAT EVER IT IS CALLED IS VERY WIDE AND HARD TO SEE TRAFFIC COMING FROM THAT SIDE ALMOST LIKE A LARGE BLIND SPOT WHEN STOPPED AND SOMEONE IS COMING TOWARDS YOU
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE HAD BLIND SPOT ASSISTANCE FOR CHANGING LANES SAFELY
YOU HAVE COVERED IT ALL 10 CLOUDS OF HEAVEN OR AIR BAGS CHARLES BELENCHIA
THE CAR HAS TERRIBLE BLIND SPOTS WHEN USING THE SIDE MIRRORS
NOT A BOUT SAFETY BUT I THIN TRUNL IS TOOOOO SMALLL
THERES A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT IN THE BACK CORNER I HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK
THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS BLOCK REAR VISIBILITY
DESIGN MAKES IT A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES COULD BE IMPROVED
FOG LIGHTS FOG LIGHTS FOG LIGHTS THEY ARE GREAT IN FOG RAIN AND SNOWY WEATHER CONDITIONS I WAS A FOUR TIME SUBARU OWNER AND ALWAYS HAD FOG LIGHTS I TRULY MISS THEM
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE TRULY A JOKE THEY DON T EVEN WIPE THE WINDSHIELD VERY POOR CONSTRUCTION I HAD TO BUY NEW WIPER BLADE REPLACEMENTS AND THE CAR ONLY HAS 3600 MILES ON IT THE NEXT THING IS THAT YOU CAN T SEE CARS ON THE SIDE OF YOU
BLIND SPOTS
INSTRUMENT PANEL VISABILITY IS VERY GOOD WITH DIGITAL SPEEDOMETER DISPLAY BUT RADIO DISPLAY IS VERY DIFFICULT TO READ WHILE DRIVING SUNVISORS WHEN POSITIONED OVER SIDE WINDOW DO NOT EXTEND REARWARD ENOUGH
SIDE MIRROR ARE TOO SMALL THERE IS NO CENTER CONSOLE IT SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO PUT THINGS IN REAR HEAD REST BLOCK VISION OUT OF REAR WINDOW WHEN VIEWING VIA REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE BLIND SPOT IS BAD U CANT SEE THE CARS IN THE LEFT LANE AND IF U TRY TO PASS AND ONE IS THERE U CANT SEE THEM AND I ALMOST SIDE SWIPED A CAR BECAUSE I COULDN T SEE IT
BACK CORNER BLIND SPOTS REQUIRE THAT AN EXTRA MIRROR BE ATTACHED TO SEE
WISH IT HAD BETTER BLIND SPOT MONITORING   VISABILITY
WHILE DRIVING I CANNOT LOOK OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER TO PEAR OUT THE LEFT REAR DOOR WINDOW TO SEE IF THERE IS A CAR IN MY BLIND SPOT ALSO I WISH THE FRONT PASSENGER HEADREST COULD BE LOWERED MORE SO THAT THE HEADREAST WOULD NOT OBSTRUCT MY VISION A
BACKUP CAMERA WAS NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME CAN T IMAGINE NOT HAVING THE TOOL TO ASSIST WITH VISIBILITY AND SAFETY NOW I FEEL LIKE MY ANIMALS ARE ALOT SAFER DON T WANT ANY ACCIDENTS ON THE HOME FRONT
NEED TO DESIGN A CAMERA FOR THE FRONT FOR PARKING
WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO DO BEAT FAST ENOUGH IN HEAVY RAIN
ALL OTHER TRUCKS I NOTICE HAVE FOG LIGHTS THIS TRUCK DID NOT COME WITH FOG LIGHTS
COLUMN BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR SIDE WINDOW CREATES A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT AT SOME INTERSECTIONS
BACK UP CAMERA IS A CRITICAL SAFETY FEATURE DUE TO HIGH TRUCK BED WORKS EXCEPTIONALLY WELL
TRUCK SITS PRETTY HIGH UP STOCK SO YOU HAVE TO GET USE TO LOOKING DOWN AT MOST OTHER CARS REGULAR HAS BLIND SPOTS AT B PILLAR
SMALL BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE AT LANE CHANGE BUT ADDTIONAL SIDE MIRROR IS PROVIDED FOR VISIBILITY
SEEING OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW IS FINE THE SIDE WINDOWS ARE LITTLE SMALL THERE IS A SMALL BLINDSPOT
I INSTALLED A BEDCAP FOR MY DOGS WHEN DRIVING SO THE INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR VIEW IS GREATLY REDUCED
I DON T LIKE THAT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT OVER THE DRIVER S LEFT SHOULDER
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES AND IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES
OVERALL VISIBILITY IS QUITE POOR
I FIND IT A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OUT THE DRIVER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE LEFT CHECKING MY BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES
SUN VISOR IS OF NO USE WHEN MOVED TO THE SIDE WINDOW POSITION TOO SMALL TO DO ANY GOOD I INSTALLED TINTED WINDOWS SO I DIDN T GO BLIND WHEN THE SUN WAS ON THE DRIVER S SIDE OF THE CAR
BLIND SPOT IS QUITE LARGE WHEN LOOKING BACK AND TO EITHER SIDE FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
BIG BLIND SPOT LOOKING LEFT TO REAR AND LEFT SIDE EVEN WITH THE LITTLE EUROPEAN TYPE MIRROR
MODERATE BLIND SPOTS BUT BUILT IN BLIND SPOT MIRROR DOES HELP SLIGHTLY BUT REAR VIEW MIRROR VISIBILITY IS A CHALLENGE
ON THE 500C THE EXTRA WIDE ANGLE SIDE MIRROR IS AN ADDED SAFETY FEATURE THAT HAS HELPED BUT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO THE SUN VISORS ARE TOO SMALL
VERY DIFFICULT BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE
TOUGH TO SEE BLIND SPOTS AND BEHIND YOU IN THIS CAR
THE LOW REAR VISIBILITY CAN BE REMEDIED BY AN AFTERMARKET REARVIEW MIRROR LIKE I HAVE OR TURNING YOUR HEAD A LITTLE MORE
HUGE BLIND SPOT BEHIND THE PASSENGER SEAT
I M 6FT TALL AND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR CREATES A BLIND SPOT FOR ME ON THE HIGHWAY WITH SEE CARS GETTING ON THE HIGHWAY
I AM NOT USED TO HAVING TO RELY ON THE WIDE ANGLE MIRROR TO CHECK MY BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES YET OTHER THAN THAT I FEEL VERY SAFE IN MY FIAT 500
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT WHERE THE ROOF SUPPORTS ARE SOMETIMES CANNOT SEE ONCOMING CAR IF AT AN ANGLE
NO ISSUES I WAS HARD TO GET USE TO AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE HUGE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE BUT I GOT USE TO UTILIZING THE SIDE MIRROR AND I FEEL SAFE
STEERING WHEEL DESIGN OBSCURES VISIBILITY OF PORTIONS OF DASH IN SOME POSITIONS
SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT WITH SEAT AND REAR WINDOW POSTS THAT CAN SNEAK UP ON YOU WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE LEFT
THE REAR CAMERA IS A PLUS
THE HEAD RESTS GET IN THE WAY WHEN LOOKING BACK AND BACKING UP OTHER THAN THAT VISIBILITY IS GOOD
YOU CAN T SEE OUT OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN DRIVING BECAUSE OF THE BACK SEAT HEADLIGHTS NEED TO BE ADJUSTED SO YOU CAN SEE MORE OF THE ROAD AHEAD OF YOU THE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR NEEDS A BLIND SPOT MIRROR
THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER DOESN T CLEAN ENOUGH OF THE WINDSHIELD
THE AUTO DIMMING REARVIEW MIRROR IS FANTASTIC
360 DEGREE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT AND SOMETHING OTHERS COMMENT ON ALSO
I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY SURPRISED AT THE VISIBILITY IN GENERAL BUT I FIND THE VIEWING FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR A BIT OBSTRUCTED THANK GOODNESS FOR REAR VIEW CAMERAS
GREAT VISIBILITY IN THIS CAR
WISH I COULD GET TINTED WINDOWS AND A LONGER VISOR WHEN I NEED TO PUT VISOR ON DRIVERS DOOR WINDOW TOO SHORT
I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO NOTE THAT THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORK FROM THE CENTER AND SWEEP OUTWARDS I THINK THAT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE TRADITIONAL METHOD THE NEW WAY ALLOWS FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS OF VISIBILITY TO BE COVERED VERY EFFICI
IF THERE IS AN ADULT PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SEAT THE DRIVER HAS QUITE A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT TO THE RIGHT HAVING SAID THAT THE SIDE MIRRORS WITH THE EXTRA LITTLE CONVEX CORNERS DO HELP A LOT WHEN CHANGING LANES HOWEVER THEY DO NOT HELP WHEN
BLIND SPOT MIRROR IS OK BUT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO
BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT SIDE IS VERY DIFFICULT
I VERY MUCH LIKE THE DRIVERS SIDE INSET MIRROR IT FEELS AS THOUGH I HAVE NO BLIND SPOTS
I REMOVED GPS TOM TOM DEVICE AS IT REDUCED FRONT VISIBILITY
CANNOT SEE OUT SIDES MUST USE BLIS
EXCELLENT SIZE OF WINDSHIELD FOR GREAT VISIBILITY AND GREAT WIPERS THAT CLEAN ENTIRE WINDSHIELD
THE FASTEST SETTING FOR THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS IS NOT FAST ENOUGH
I LIKE THE FRONT WIPERS WASHERS BUT I DISLIKE THE REAR WIPER CONTROL IT IS HARD TO USE WHILE DRIVING AND OCCASIONALLY TURNS ON WHEN BUMPED ACCIDENTALLY
I THINK THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS COULD BE HIGHER QUALITY FROM THE FACTORY
BRAKES ARE NOT AS STRONG AS I D LIKE THEM TO BE I WISH THE WINDOWS WOULD TINT AT DARK TO PREVENT HEADLIGHT GLARE FROM BLINDING
FRONT HEAD REST AND SIDE DOOR PANELS HAS BLIND SPOTS
EVEN WITH THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR LIGHTS I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE SMALL BLIND SPOT MIRROR IN THE CORNER OF THE SIDE MIRRORS
LOW BEAMS SEEM TO HAVE A AREA THAT IS CUT OFF OF THE TOP OF THE BEAM THEY SHINE GOOD ON THE ROAD BUT MAY LACK VISIBILITY DOWN THE ROAD DUE TO THE TOP BEING SHADED
THE VISIBILITY IS FANTASTIC THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS HUGE AND EASY TO SEE OUT OF
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A FORWARD CAMERA THERE IS A FORWARD SENSOR THAT BEEPS WHEN YOU GET VERY CLOSE TO SOMETHING BUT IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE A FORWARD CAMERA THAT THEN SWITCHES ON IF YOU ARE PULLING INTO A PARKING SPACE FOR EXAMPLE
BLIND SPOTS SOMETIMES WHEN CHANGING LANES ON INTERSTATE
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT THE GREATEST I HAVE USED AND NORMALLY WHEN YOU BUY A NEW VEHICLE THEY ARE GREAT AND YOU DON T WANT TO REPLACE THEM THE HEADLIGHTS AREN T THAT GREAT EITHER
OUR FAVORITE FEATURE OF THE VEHICLE IS THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA
FRONT HAND GRIPS ON DRIVER SIDE OBSTRUCTS VIEW WHEN PULLING OUT IN TRAFFIC AND HEAD LIGHTS AND FOG LIGHTS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH
BIG BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVER SIDE
IF I COULD SIT UP HIGHER AND LOOK OUT THE WINDOWS EASIER I D FEEL SAFER I LIKE TO SEE FOR REAL NOT JUST WITH A MIRROR OR CAMERA
IT HAS REALLY BAD BLIND SPOTS
I WOULD LIKE THE LONG DISTANCE OUTSIDE MIRROR AND BLIND SPOT IN ONE MIRROR
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT INFO SYSTEM FOR CHANGING LANES
WISH IT HAD FOG LIGHTS
MAKE THE LIGHT FOR THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING BIGGER OR EASIER TO SEE
WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM THE VISIBILITY WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC
THE REASON FOR REPORTING ANY VISIBILITY PROBLEMS IS THE FACT THAT THE VERY STUPID HEAD RESTS ARE IN THE WAY DRIVER PASSENGER 2ND ROW SEATS AND 3RD ROW SEATS HAVE HEAD RESTS THAT ARE TOO LARGE I WOULD GUESS THAT PROBABLY MOST NEW VEHICLES HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO BLIND SPOTS WITH THE TOWING MIRRORS
THE REDUCTION IN SIZE OF THE MIRRORS FROM THE PREVIOUS GENERATION WAS NOT A GOOD THING IN REGARDS TO VISIBILITY BIGGER MIRRORS PLEASE
REAR HEAD RESTS ARE LARGE AND OBSTRUCT REAR VIEW
BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT WHEN PULLONG OUT ONTO T INERSECTION
I WOULD HAVE WISHED FOR A LITTLE LARGER REAR VIEW MIRROR THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS ADEQUATE BUT I EXPECTED A BIGGER ONE IN A BIGGER VEHICLE SUCH AS A F 150 OTHERWISE EVERYTHING IS EXCELLENT
WISH CAR HAD NOTIFICATION OF VEHICLES IN BLIND SPOT
REAR VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IS LESS THAN IDEAL
I REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR PART OF THE SIDE MIRRORS I CAN SEE ANYONE AROUND ME ON THE ROAD THE BACKUP CAMERA IS VERY USEFUL AS WELL
FOR THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE THE HEADLIGHTS AT NIGHT DO NOT PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL COVERAGE OF THE ROAD AHEAD OTHER SMALLER VEHICLES HAVE BETTER HEADLIGHT SYSTEMS
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS WHERE BIGGER
THE BACK UP CAM IS VERY COOL
HARD TO SEE LITTLE CARS IN SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS BUT THAT S WHAT YOU GET WHEN DRIVING A BIG TRUCK
THE MIRRORS AND SUPPORT FOR THE ROOF WINDSHIELD CREATE A GIANT BLIND SPOT ON EACH SIDE OF THE DRIVERS VISION
BACK UP CAMERA IN MIRROR NEEDS TO BE LARGER HALF OF THE MIRROR NOT A QUARTER
HAVE A LIGHT IN THE MIRROR THAT LIGHTS UP WHEN A VEHICLE IS ALONG SIDE YOU IN YOUR BLIND SPOT IN CASE YOU WANT TO CHANGE LANES
THE NEW LED HEADLIGHTS ARE THE FINEST I VE SEEN THE LIGHT OUTPUT IS EXCEPTIONAL THE REAL LED TAIL LIGHTS ARE REALLY BRIGHT AND CAN BEEN SEEN VERY FAR AWAY THERE S NO REASON FOR SOMEONE TO SAY THEY DIDN T SEE YOUR TURN SIGNAL ON
BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY NOT GOOD
REAR VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE DISTANCE THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A REAR CAMERA
SITS UP HIGH WITH GOOD VISIBILITY AND EASE OF HANDLING
HAS MANY BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDES
A VEHICLE THAT CAN TOW AS WELL AS THE DURANGO SHOULD HAVE EXTENDABLE SIDE MIRRORS FOR BETTER VISIBILITY OF TRAILER BEING TOWED
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE THAT I AM LEARNING TO COMPENSATE FOR
THE SEATS OF THE THIRD ROW BLOCK THE REAR VIEW MIRROW
THE VISORS ARE PLACED PERFECTLY THAT I CAN ACTUALLY USE THEM NOW AND NO SUN GLARES OR BLINDSPOT FROM CORNER OF WINDSHIELD AND SIDE OF CAR
WHEN THE THIRD ROW OF SEATS ARE IN THE UP POSITION IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO HAVE COMPLETE VISIBILITY OF ALL SURROUNDINGS
BLIND SPOT IS TOUGH CAN NOT SEE THAT WELL EVEN WHEN I LOOK I USE VISORS A LOT THIS ONE WONT PUSH UP FLUSH WITH WINDOW ONLY GOES PART WAY AS DESGINED
DRIVERS EXTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR SHOULD HAVE FACTORY BLIND SPOT ADDED I ADDED ONE AND TOOK CARE OF THE PROBLEM
FEEL SAFE WITH 10 AIRBAGS
NO BLIND SPOT MIRRORS CAN BE HARD TO SEE BEHIND WHEN BACKING
BRING BACK THE LARGER MIRRORS FR0M PERVIOUS DURANGO S BLIND SPOT IS WAY TO BIG ON BOTH SIDES OF VEHICLE
VISIBILITY AND SAFETY IS FANTASTIC DRIVING THIS VEHICLE
I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN CONTROL ALL THE HEAD REST TO GO DOWN FOR MORE VISIBILTY IN BACK OF THE DRIVER SEAT
BLIND SPOTS ARE A PROBLEM IN THIS VEHICLE
BIGGEST VISIBILITY ISSUE IS PARKING AND NOT SEEING CURB SINCE VEHICLE SITS SO HIGH
THE AUTOMATIC PROJECTOR HEADLAMPS ALONG WITH RAIN SENSING WIPERS ALLOWS ME TO DRIVE SAFER PERIOD I CAN PAY ATTENTION TO THE ROAD RATHER THAN WORRY ABOUT ADJUSTING WIPER BLADE SPEED
REAR BACK UP CAMERA WOULD HAVE BEEN A NICE OPTION TO GET
IT S A BIG TRUCK I LOVE THE FORWARD FACING VIEW OF TRAFFIC I DO NOT LIKE THE LANE CHANGING VIEWS I AM GOING TO INSTALL BLIND SPOT MIRRORS I WISH THE TRUCK HAD BLIND SPOT WARNING AND LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM INSTALLED
REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT A DESIGN ISSUE THE WINDOWS AND MIRRORS ARE EFFECTIVE AND LARGE ENOUGH DRIVER HAS NOT GOTTEN USED TO BACK UP DISTANCES OR SEEING OBJECTS IN BLIND SPOTS
SIDE MIRRORS BLIND SPOTS
NEEDS LED HEADLIGHTS
BLIND SPOT IS SEMI BAD
THE SMALL MIRROR INSIDE SIDE MIRROR REMOVES BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES LOVE IT
BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS PARTICULARLY NICE
WITH HOW CHOPPED THE NEW MUSTANG IS IT BLOWS THE DOORS OFF OTHER AMERICAN MUSCLE CARS WHEN IT COMES TO VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFELY BEST IN CLASS IN MY OPINION
THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES AND REVERSING IS EXCELLENT FOR A 2 DOOR COUPE STYLE
TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING TO THE RIGHT
THE SMALL REAR WINDOWS CAUSE BLIND SPOTS
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY
FEELS LIKE THERE ARE ONE OR TWO SMALL BLIND SPOTS AND WE RE GRATEFUL FOR THE REAR CAMERA AND COLLISION ALERTS
THE HID HEADLIGHTS AND LED TAILIGHTS
A SURPRISING IMPROVEMENT IN FEEL AND VISIBILITY OVER LAST YEAR S MODEL
USING INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR REAR VISION IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED
COMPARED TO PREVIOUS TAURUS DECREASED VISIBILITY OUT OF FRONT WINDOW
VISIBILITY IS FURTHER LIMITED BY UNNECESSARY BLACK PLASTIC COVERING PASSENGER AND DRIVER SIDE WINDOWS
AS ALREADY STATED POOR VISIBILITY WITH DIM HEADLIGHTS BRIGHTS ARE GOOD
VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING IS LESS THAN I WOULD WISH
FOR FUTURE MODELS FOCUS ON BLIND SPOTS AND LESS ON REAR VISIBILITY CONTROL MAYBE CONSIDER A LAN SWITCH CAMERA THAT MONITORS THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF YOUR VEHICLE DURING A LANE CHANGE
MADE WITH SAFETY IN MIND
ALL TIME BACK CAMERA I M DON T HAVE BACK WINDOW
THE PILLARS ARE REALLY BIG AND BULKY AND THE REAR WINDOW IS SO HIGH THAT IT REALLY LIMITS THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW I WOULD SUGGEST ADDING A BUTTON TO THE CAR TO VIEW VIA THE REAR CAMERA WHILE IN DRIVE TO GET A BETTER VIEW
I LOVE THE SIDE MIRROR WARNING SYSTEM AND THE BACKUP WARNING FOR APPROACHING VEHICLE
THIS IS MY 4TH TAURUS AND I REALLY TRUST IN THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE
COMPARING AGAINST MY NON US VEHICLE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OVERALL WIDE VIEW OF THE ROAD FROM DRIVER SEAT BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS ALSO LESS IT TAKES GETTING USED TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS LESSER OVERALL VISIBILITY FROM ALL ANGLES
THERE IS NO 2ND SUN VISORS ON THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN SUN IS SETTING VISIBILITY IS BAD
REAR WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT VERY EFFECTIVE
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY
LOW BEEM LIGHTS AT NIGHT HAVE A VISIBLE HORIZON LINE VERSUS BEING OVERALL LIT UP SO FEEL NEED TO HAVE HIGH BEAMS ON ALL THE TIME
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS VERY GOOD AND HELPFUL
IT HAS FEWER BLIND SPOTS THAN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE
LIKE THE HEADLIGHTS
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP
I LIKE THE WAY I CAN SEE OUT THE WINDOW WHEN LOOKING BEHIND TO CHANGE LANES THE LINES SEEM A BIT HIGHER SONG HAVE BETTER VISIBILITY BEHIND ME
WITH A QUALITY VEHICLES AS THIS IT SHOULD HAVE HAD AN OPTION FOR HID HEADLIGHTS OR BE A STANDARD ACCESSORY PROJECTOR BEAM IS A GOOD START BUT HID S TO MATCH THE LED ACCENT LIGHTS WITH THE LED ACCENT LIGHTS AS DRL WOULD HAVE MADE THIS A HOME RUN
REAR CAMERA CAN BE RENDERED USELESS BY SUNLIGHT TRY TO CUT DOWN ON GLARE
THE LOW BEAM HEAD LIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL AND PROVIDE GREAT VISBILITY
THE REAR CAMERA MAKES IT EASY TO BACKUP
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS EXTREMELY USEFUL SINCE I VE GOTTEN USED TO IT
WHEN BACKING INTO PARKING SPACE WHICH I DO DAILY CANNOT SEE PARKING LINES UNLESS YOU TILT MIRROR DOWN 8 AUDIO SCREEN TOO BRIGHT AT ALL TIMES UNLESS YOU TURN IT DOWN WHICH LOWERS THE VISIBILITY OF YOU R DASH SPEEDOMETER LIGHTING VERY DISTRAC
I LIKE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA THE HOOD SEEMS TO BE A TAD HIGH SLIGHTLY RESTRICTING LOW PROFILE CLOSE ITEMS TO THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WHEN PARKING
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE A BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE IN ADDITION TO THE ONE ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
I MENTIONED THE HEADLIGHT ISSUES EARLIER IN THIS SURVEY
LOVE THE OVERALL HANDLING & SAFETY OF THE SIERRA
LOVE THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA
LOVE THE BIG REAR VIEW TRAILERING MIRRORS BUT NEED TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN TURNING TO LOOK AROUND THEM NOT A PROBLEM THAT CAN BE SOLVED NEED BIG MIRRORS
THE TRAILER MIRRORS ARE HARD TO SEE AROUND WHEN TURNING SOMETIMES
BLIND SPOTS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT PASSENGER SIDE OF VEHICLE SIDE DO TO DESIGN OF FRONT PASSENGER SEAT BELT CASING
THE DOUBLE CAB SEEMS TO HAVE A FEW MORE BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHILE IN THE DRIVERS SEAT
YOU SOMETIMES ENCOUNTER A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING FORWARD AND LEFT OUT THE DRIVERS SIDE DOOR WINDOW BECAUSE OF THE MIRROR AND WINDSHIELD PILLAR BUT IF YOU KNOW IT S THERE YOU ADJUST FOR IT
THERE IS A LITTLE OF A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING BACK TO CHANGE LANES
I REALLY LIKE THE LANE EXIT WARNING SYSTEM
MORE VISIBLE NIGHT VISION REAR VIEW CAMERA AFTER DARK
POST ON DRIVER DOOR IS QUITE LARGE MAKING IT SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS ON THE LEFT I DO HAVE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION ON THE VEHICLE WHICH REALLY HELPS
BLIND SPOT DRIVER SIDE FRONT WINDSHIELD LEFT CORNER
THE GMC TERRAIN IS A SOLID COMFORTABLE ATTRACTIVE VEHICLE SINCE I AM RATHER SHORT I HAVE SOME PROBLEM WITH VISIBILITY WHERE THE SIDE MIRRORS BLOCK SOME LATERAL VISION
WHILE THE BACK UP CAMERA DOES DISPLAY A COLLISION GRID AND PATH OF TRAVEL IT DOES NOT ALARM EITHER VISUALLY OR AUDIBLY WHEN AN OBJECT IS ABOUT TO BE STRUCK
I FEEL THERE IS NOT ENOUGH VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW
BETTER SIDE VISIBILITY
GMC HAS REGRESSED VERY MUCH WITH REGARD TO REAR VISIBILITY AND VISIBILITY IN LANE CHANGING FROM LAST YEARS GMC DENALI�ESPECIALLY NOTICEABLE WHILE TOWING
THE REASOUN I GAVE REAR VISABILITY A 6 IS BEACUASE WITH THE THIRS ROW HEAD RESTS UP THERE IS LIMITED VIEW THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BUT IT IS NOT THAT BAD I JUST TRY TO KEEP THE HEAD RESTS DOWN UNLESS THERE IS A PASSANGER IN THE THRID ROW SETA
I THINK ALL BIGGER VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE SENSORY VISIBILTY ASSISTANCE THERE ARE MANY BLIND APOTS IN THIS VEHICLE AND I HAVE TO TURN ALL THE WAY AROUND TO SEE VEHICLES BESIDE ME
VISIBILITY IS GREAT IN THIS VEHICLE ESPECIALLY WITH ALL OF THE ASSISTS OPTIONS IT HAS IN THIS VEHICLE S PACKAGE
REAR VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT WHEN REAR VIDEO IS NOT IN USE
THERE ARE A LOT OF POTENTIAL DISTRACTIONS TO A DRIVER WITH ALL OF THE CONTROLS AVAILABLE ON BOTH THE STEERING WHEEL AND THE CENTER OF THE DASHBOARD IT IS VERY EASY TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE ROAD IN ORDER TO LOOK FOR SOMETHING WITHIN THE ELECTRON
REAR VISIBILITY SLIGHTLY BLOCKED BY REAR SEAT HEADRESTS
I REALLY HAVEN T EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEMS WITH THIS LIST OF FEATURES I M COMFORTABLE WITH THE VISIBILITY AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND VISORS I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS
1 HEADLIGHT HIGH BEAMS ARE NOT VERY BRIGHT 2 WE ALSO WISH THE RADIO NAVIGATION DISPLAY HAD A SEPARATE DIMMER CONTROL FROM THE DASH IT S TOO BRIGHT AT NIGHT OR THE DASH IT TOO DIM IT HAS AN OFF CAPABILITY BUT THEN ONE CAN NOT SEE THE TIME OR
I USE THE BLIND SPACE MIRROR A LOT ON THE HIGHWAY MORE CAMERAS MIGHT BE A GOOD THING WHILE THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALLER THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE WITH THE REAR CAMERA ITS ABSOLUTELY FINE
THE ONLY THING I REALLY DON T LIKE ABOUT MY CAR IS THE POOR VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THE PIECE ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK REALLY HAMPERS THE VISIBILITY I USE MY SIDE MIRRORS A LOT TO COMPENSATE
HAD BLIND SPOT IN THAT I NO LONGER HAVE IN MODEL
HARD TO SE OUT BACK WITH THIRD SEAT UP BACK UP CAMERA IS A MUST
THANK GOODNESS FOR THE REAR CAMERA
THE BAR ACROSS THE REAR HATCH DOOR IMPEDES VISIBILITY DIRECTLY TO THE REAR I LIKE THE STYLE OF THE VEHICLE BUT THIS FEELS LIKE AN ISSUE AN OPTION TO USE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA WHILE DRIVING AT TIMES WOULD BE NICE
I LIKE THE CAMERA O THE RIGHT OUTSIDE MIRROR WHICH SHOWS YOU THE LANE TO THE RIGHT WHEN YOU NEED TO MOVE A LANE TO THE RIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SAME ABILITY ON THE LEFT MIRROR FOR WHEN YOU CHANGE LANES MOVING LEFT
I D LIKE A DRIVER S SIDE REAR CAMERA
THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR
THE REAR WINDSHIELD DOESN T GIVE A TON OF VISIBILITY BEHIND THE CAR THE DESIGN AND LOOK OF THE CAR FROM THE OUTSIDE ARE EXCEPTIONAL SO I WOULDN T NECESSARILY CONSIDER ALTERING IT TOO MUCH BUT AT TIMES IT FEELS LIKE THERE IS VERY LITTLE SPACE B
LED LIGHTS SHOULD BE IN THE EXL NAV
SPLIT SIDE VIEW MIRROR CAUSES A BLIND SPOT
POOR VISIBILITY ON REAR HATCH
REAR VISIBILITY TAKE SOME TIME TO GET USED TO
THE DRIVER SITS MUCH HIGHER IN THE CROSSTOUR RELATIVE TO THE DASH AND WINDOWSILLS THAN IN THE ACCORD THIS PROVIDES GREAT OUTWARD VISIBILITY AND IS MUCH PREFERRED BY MY SPOUSE WHO IS MUCH SHORTER BY COMPARISON YOU SIT DOWN LOWER IN THE ACCOR
CAN SEE OUT OF REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN READ VIDEO SCREEN IS DOWN OR WHEN 3RD ROW SEATS ARE UP
I LIKE THE REAR AND RIGHT SIDE CAMERAS AND I THINK A LEFT SIDE CAMERA WOULD IMPROVE THINGS GREATLY
LOTS OF BLIND SPOT ISSUES SIDE CAMERA HELPS OUT A LOT THOUGH VIEW OUT THE BACK OF THE CAR IS VERY LIMITING
BLIND SPOT INDICATORS ARE VERY HELPFUL SINCE THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE A BIT UNDERSIZED WHEN COMPARED TO A SIERRA
REAR HATCH PARTIALLY OBSCURES REAR VIEW
MY HAD A SMALL FISH EYE MIRROR LOCATED ON THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR I FOUND IT USEFUL AND MAY BE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED ON ALL VEHICLES
REAR WINDOW IS A BIT SMALL AND THERE S A PRETTY BIG BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE DUE TO SEAT BACKS
I SAT IN AT LEAST 50 DIFFERENT CARS AND TESTED THEIR VISIBILITY TOWARD THE BACK AND SIDES FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT AND THIS ONE WAS OF THE VERY BEST SAFETY IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAN STYLING BUT THIS WAS THE CAR WITH THE BEST COMBINATION
I REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR
REAR PILLAR BLIND SPOT VERY SLIGHT THOUGH
THE BLIND SIDE MIRRORS ARE A GREAT ADDITION
IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE RIGHT SIDE WHEN LOOKING FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC THE BAR BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK OF THE CAR CREATES A NASTY BLIND SPOT
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER ANGLES MAKE FOR A LOT MORE VISIBILITY
SAFETY WHEN BACKING UP NEEDS AN UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW THAT IS EASY TO ACHIEVE THE LAST CAR I HAD WITH THAT ADVANTAGE WAS MY 1997 ESCORT
FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT AS VARIABLE AS I WOULD LIKE
ONCE AGAIN I CANNOT SEE THE DISPLAY SCREEN NAVIGATION SYSTEM BLUETOOTH WHEN IS FACED BY THE SUN
HEADLIGHTS ARE INCREDIBLE SIDE MIRRORS GREAT VISIBILITY GOOD
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT ON THIS CAR I LOVE THE LITTLE MIRROR WITHIN THE MIRROR
LOVE THE SMALL BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON THE NEW FORDS
WOULD LIKE REAR WIPER BLADES TO MAKE REAR VISIBILITY BETTER I GOT USED TO THEM IN MY WINSTAR AND THAT IS THE ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT THAT I HAVE WITH THE FIESTA
THE ONLY KNOCK ON THE SAFETY IS THAT THE CAR IS SMALL BUT I KNEW THAT GOING IN IT FEELS VERY SAFE BUT IN A COLLISION WITH A MUCH BIGGER VEHICLE I M GOING TO LOSE THE ONLY KNOCK ON THE VISIBILITY IS THAT I HAVE REMOVED THE READ HEADRESTS TO
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS DUE TO MIRROR PLACEMENTS AND A PILLARS
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS INCLUDE A USEFUL MIRROR WITHIN THE MIRROR THAT VIRTUALLY ELIMINATE THE BLINDSPOT OF THE VEHICLE ALLOWING ME TO SEE CARS THAT I OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE
I LOVE THE EUROPEAN STYLE WINDSHIELD WIPERS
I FIND THE SMALL BLINDSPOT MIRRORS A LITTLE CONFUSING AND DISTRACTING ESPECIALLY AFTER HAVING THE ELECTRONIC BLINDSPOT SYSTEM ON MY PREVIOUS FORD
SMALL CONVEX MIRROR IN SIDE MIRROR NEEDS TO BE ON EVERY CAR LOVE MINE
THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE A NICE TOUCH
AUTO DIMING REAR VIEW MIRROR NOT DARK ENOUGH
HAVING PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE JUST AFTER HAVING AN ACCIDENT WHERE I DID NOT SEE A VEHICLE IN MY BLIND SPOT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE MY NEW VEHICLE HAD ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURES ON IT I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE SAFETY FEATURES ON THIS VEHICLE HOWEVE
VERY HAPPY WITH BLIND SPOT SIDE MIRROR
VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD FOR CAR OF THIS TYPE DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY ISN T GREAT BUT FOR A SPORTY COUPE THERE S GREAT VISIBILITY OUTWARD
I HAVE NOT DRIVEN THAT MUCH AT NIGHT TO FAIRLY ANSWER ABOUT THE VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT CAN BE TRICKY SO I M GLAD THE CAR HAS THE BLIS SYSTEM TO INDICATE WHEN A ANOTHER VEHICLE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT
STILL HARD TO SEE IN BLIND SPOT AREA OF PASSENGER SIDE REAR
DESPITE THE TWO SECTION LEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR I FIND A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT THAT CANNOT BE ELIMINATED BY REPOSITIONING THE MIRROR OR DRIVER I THINK THAT THIS BLIND SPOT COULD BE ELIMINATED BY INCREASING THE ANGLE OF VIEW OF THE OUTER SECTION O
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A VISOR EXTENSION LIKE ON THE CHEVY TRUCKS AND VANS JUST A PIECE THAT SLIDES OUT TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE VISIBILITY AS A TALL PERSON THE VISOR DOES NOT REACH FAR ENOUGH WHEN USING IT ON THE DOOR SIDE TO EFFECTIVELY BLOCK TH
LEFT TURN VISIBILITY BLOCKED BY WINDOW FRAME I WISH IT WERE TRANSPARENT AAND OR NARROWER
WINDSHIELD WIPERS LEAVE WATER SPLASHES ON WINDOW AND LEAVES A SMALL SPOT NOT COVERED ON PASSENGER SIDE
SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVER S SIDE TO THE RIGHT REAR
WHY IS THERE NOT A LEFT SIDE MIRROR CAMERA
AGAIN CAR SHOULD COME WITH BLIND SPOT TECHNOLOGY THE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA IS GOOD BUT YOU MUST ENGAGE IT AND NOTHING ON DRIVERS SIDE
MY CAR HAS THE STOCK MIRROR FOR ANY NORMAL CAR BUT I WOULD PREFER A LARGER REAR VIEW MIRROR
I M SHORT AND THE CAR IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE MORE VISIBILITY BUT BECAUSE OF WHERE I HAVE TO SIT IT REMOVES SOME OF THE ADVANTAGES
HONDA HAS SUPERIORLY DESIGNED THE FIT TO BE DRIVER CENTERED FOCUSED THERE IS TRULY PERFECT VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT IN THE FRONT WINDOW WHEN YOU TURN LEFT
I LIKE THE ATTEMPT TO BUILD IN A BLIND SPOT MIRROR SEGMENT IT COULD BE A LITTLE MORE PRONOUNCED
THE LANEWATCH CAMERA WOULD BE VERY USEFUL ON THE DRIVER SIDE ALSO
I WISH THE BACKUP CAMERA WAS AVAILABLE WHEN DRIVING FORWARD
I LIKE THE REAR BACK UP CAMERAS IT S NICE THEY ARE INCLUDED IN MY FIT
VISIBILITY IN THE BACK QUADRANT IS VERY POOR AND LOT OF CAUTION IS REQUIRED TO AVOID BACKING INTO OBJECTS THE LARGER SIDE MIRRORS ARE HELPFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES OR PASSING
I CAN SEE VERY WELL OUT OF THIS CAR I ALSO LOVE THE REAR CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT CAMERA AS WELL
THE CAMERA ON THE PASSENGER OUTSIDE MIRROR IS EXCELLENT GREAT VIEW OF WHAT IS ON YOUR RIGHT AND DISTANCE FROM VEHICLE
CAMERA IS OFTEN FOGGED UP AND IS NOT CLEAR IN WET WEATHER
THIS VEHICLE HAS EXCELLENT VISABILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
IF A PASSENGER IS SITTING IN THE REAR HE SHOULD SIT BEHIND THE DRIVER OR IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK USING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
I HAVE DIFFICULTY WHEN CORNERING TO THE LEFT IN THE LEFT LANE SEEING HOW CLOSE I AM TO THE CURB OR RAILING THIS IS CAUSED BY THE PLACEMENT OF THE LEFT WINDSHIELD SUPPORT THIS IS THE ONLY CONDITION I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH VISIBILITY
THE RIGHT TURN REAR CAMERA IS GREAT SHOULD HAVE THE SAME FOR LEFT TURN
WHEN COMING OFF PRIVATE ROAD TO MAIN ROAD AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 30 DEGREES FROM LEFT SIDE OF MAIN ROAD IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY VEHICLES COMING DUE TO MAJOR BLIND SPOT
I REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT CAMERA ON THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR HOWEVER I USUALLY HAVE MORE OF A BLIND SPOT PROBLEM ON THE DRIVER S SIDE AND WOULD PREFER IT TO BE ON THAT SIDE IF ONE HAD TO CHOOSE IT WOULD BE VERY NICE TO HAVE IT ON BOTH MIRR
I HAVE FOUND SEVERAL TIMES IN AROUND TOWN TRAFFIC THAT I HAVE A BLIND SPOT AT THE FRONT OF SIDE WINDOWS WHERE THERE IS THAT SMALL TRIANGLE OF WINDOW SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN SIDE WINDOW BY A WIDE BAND MANY TIMES I HAVE MISSED THE FACT THAT THERE I
VISIBILITY IN THE AREA OF THE TINY FRONT LEFT WINDOW IS NOT GOOD THE STRUCTURE OF THE CAR SURROUNDING THAT TINY WINDOW INTERRUPTS THE VIEW CONSIDERABLY THIS MAKES IT AWKWARD TO LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION WHILE MAKING A LEFT TURN
THE REAR CAMERA SCREEN IS VERY HARD TO SEE DURING THE DAY
LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THE RIGHT TURN CAMERA
LOVE THE MULTIPLE SIDE WINDOWS WHICH AID VISIBILITY RIGHT SIDE AND REAR VIEW CAMERAS ENHANCE FEELING OF SECURITY
THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER IS A BIT SMALL AND DOES NOT CLEAR THE WHOLE WINDOW
WHEN YOU COME TO A STOP SIGN AND THEN TURN LEFT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT SO THAT YOU CAN ONLY SEE 3 4S OF THE ROAD YOU ARE ON WHAT YOU SEE IS THE METAL BAR ON THE LEFT OF THE FRAME THAT HOLDS THE LEFT SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD IN PLACE A PASSENGER O
THE FORWARD VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING AIDED BY THE GLASS VENT WINDOWS ADJACENT TO THE WINDSHIELD THE REAR VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING WHEN THE REAR HEADRESTS ARE FULLY LOWERED
I INEVITABLY COMPARE THIS ODYSSEY TO MY OLD ONE THE BACK WINDOW IS MUCH SMALLER AND THE THIRD ROW HEAD RESTS ARE AWFUL WHEN ANYONE SITS IN THE BACK THEY MUST RAISE THE HEAD REST SO HIGH THAT THE REAR WINDOW IS USELESS THE BACK UP CAMERA HELPS W
LIKE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA WHEN CHANGING LANES
VERY ROOMY COMFORTABLE NICE TO DRIVE BACK UP CAMERA COULD BE BRIGHTER IN THE SHADE SEAT BEAT ALARM SHOULD ONLY DING ONCE AS A WARNING NOT ALL THE TIME WHEN NOT IN USE WE LIVE IN THE COUNTRY ON A DIRT ROAD CAN ONLY DRIVE 15 MPH AND HAVE TO
SEEMS TO HAVE A LARGER THAN EXPECTED BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
GREAT OVERALL VISIBILITY
REAR VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT BUT I HAVE FOUND MOST MINI VANS DO NOT HAVE REAL GOOD REAR VISIBILITY
EVERYTHING IS OUTSTANDING CONCERNING THE VISIBILITY
I OWN A ACCORD TOURING THAT BLOWS THE PILOT OUT OF THE BALLPARK W SAFETY FEATURES NOTE THAT MY PILOT IS ALSO A TOURING
I REALLY LIKE THE SMALL MIRROR IN THE CORNER OF THE DRIVER S REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT SHOWS FURTHER OFF TO THE SIDE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT ON OTHER SIDE ALSO
WHEN THE WINDOW LOCK IS TURNED ON BY THE DRIVER ME I AM UNABLE TO ADJUST THE WINDOWS WHICH I FEEL IS A SAFETY ISSUE I OWNED JEEPS IN THE PAST AND WAS STILL ABLE TO CONTROL THE WINDOWS IN THE BACK THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES I NEEDED TO PUT THE W
ANOTHER ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS WE HAD IN PURCHASING A NEW VEHICLE WAS TO HAVE GOOD ALL AROUND VISIBILITY FOR THE DRIVER THE HONDA PILOT HAS EXCELLENT VISIBILITY
BETTER REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY
POOR SIDE VISIBILITY HAVE TO ASK PASSENGER TO MOVE HEAD FORWARD OR LEAN HEAD BACK TO HEAD REST IN ORDER TO SEE TO THE RIGHT
WINDING ROADS CAN CONSTANTLY MOVE THE SUN FROM HEAD ON TO DRIVER SIDE A DOUBLE VISOR WOULD HELP IN TERMS OF VISIBILITY CHECK OUT OUT A TOYOTA 4 RUNNER AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED VISIBILITY WOULD BE BETTER IF THE DRIVER SEAT CAME UP HIGH
THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES AND IN REAR IS NOT THE BEST QUALITY
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR WITHOUT THE BACK UP CAMERA
NO REAR WIPER IS A SAFETY CONCERN ESP IN RAIN
THE BLIND SPOT TO THE DRIVER S FRONT RIGHT IS QUITE LARGE AND IS LARGE ENOUGH TO HIDE A VEHICLE IN AS THE DRIVER PREPARES TO MAKE A LEFT TURN
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE LITTLE BLIND SPOT MIRROR IN THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER WISH I COULD ALSO SEE THE BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE TOO
MY ONLY DIFFICULTY SEEING OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS WHEN I USE THE POWER SCREEN TO BLOCK THE SUNLIGHT FROM COMING IN THROUGH THE REAR WIDOW IT MAKES VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW
BECAUSE OF LOCATION AND SIZE OF DRIVERS EXTERIOR MIRROR THERE A BLIND SPOT WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN
CHANGE THE AUDIO SYSTEM BEFORE AN ACCIDENT HAPPENS BECAUSE OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT BUTTON TO HIT WHILE DRIVING
I WISH THERE WAS A REAR FACING CAMERA ON THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR INSTEAD OF THE SMALL ANGLED PIECE THAT S SUPPOSED TO HELP SEE IN YOUR LEFT BLIND SPOT THAT THING IS USELESS
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE WINDOWS ESPECIALLY BACK AND REAR WERE A BIT LARGER HOWEVER THAT WOULD PROBABLY DETRACT FROM THE EXCEPTIONAL STYLING THE VISIBILITY IS ALSO MADE UP FOR BY A BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE LEFT REARVIEW MIRROR AND A BACKUP CAMERA
PASSENGER MIRROR SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR
ELECTRONIC DRIVER SAFETY FEATURES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LACKING THIS CAR ONLY HAS A REAR VIEW CAMERA AND THE GUIDELINES ON IT DO NOT ARTICULATE AS THE STEERING WHEEL IS TURNED
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING LEFT AND RIGHT WHILE AT A STOP SIGN
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS
IT SEEMS THAT THE RIGHT HEADLIGHT SHOULD BE AIMED HIGHER I CANNOT SEE SIGNS AT NIGHT EXCEPT WHEN ON HIGH BEAM
WHEN WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE IN USE IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE WINDOW
IT HAS STATE OF THE ART SAFETY FEATURES
THE BLINDSPOT MONITOR LANE DEPARTURE CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT AND PARKING ASSIST BEEPERS ALL WORK WELL AND ARE GREAT SAFETY FEATURES
I WISH MY COUPE HAD A BACK UP CAMERA
EASILY CAN LOOK AT BLIND SPOTS WITHOUT A SECOND LOOK
HAS A BAD BLIND SIDE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE ALMOST HIT A MOTORCYCLE HAVE TO LOOK HARD TO THE RIGHT TO MAKE SURE NO CARS ARE COMING
PASSENGER SIDE LIMITED VISIBILITY I HAVE INSTALLED WIDE ANGLE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS THIS WAS ALSO DONE ON MY HONDA CR V BECAUSE OF SAME ISSUE
BLIND SPOTS
REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION AND REAR COLLISION DETECTION GREAT VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTION
BLIND SPOT IN LAST CARGO WINDOW SEEMS TO SMALL
THE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHECKING OVER MY SHOULDER ARE A BIT LARGE BECAUSE OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PIECE THAT CONNECTS THE ROOF TO THE CAR OTHER THAN THAT VISIBILITY DIRECTLY IN FRONT BEHIND AND TO THE SIDES ARE JUST FINE
WHILE I USE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA I STILL LOOK OUT THE BACK TO PARK AND WOULD THEREFORE LIKE A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE THE REAR OF THE CAR ENDS A FRONT VIEW CAMERA WOULD BE USEFUL FOR PARKING AND APPROACHING CURBS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THE LOWEST PA
THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOTS THAT I HAVE FOUND WHEN I AM BACKING UP OR TRYING TO CHANGE LANES
HEADRESTS FRONT ROW SECOND ROW REDUCE VISIBILITY AM APPRECIATIVE OF REAR VIEW CAMERA TO CONFIRM REAR CLEARANCE ABSENCE OF OBJECTS I PLACED SMALL BOXES AROUND REAR OF VEHICLE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE BLIND SPOTS IF ANY SHORTLY AFTER ACQUIRING
REAR PASSENGER WINDOW SIZE LEAVES A BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOT DANGEROUS WITHOUT COLLISION WARNING
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION
I WISH THERE WAS A PULL OUT FROM THE SUN VISORS TO BLOCK THE SUN AROUND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AREA
I FIND THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM VERY HELPFUL THE SIZE OF THE MIRRORS GIVES VERY GOOD VISIBILITY
IF THE SEAT WENT HIGHER IT WOULD HELP AND THE BLIND SPOTS NEED BIGGER WINDOWS I DONT LIKE RELYING ON NOISE TO WARN
IT IS DISAPPOINTING TO NOT HAVE A BACK UP CAMERA IN THIS CAR OTHERWISE THE VISIBILITY IS GOOD
SEVERE BLIND SPOT IN REAR
I LIKE THE WARNING LIGHTS ON THE MIRRORS WHEN SOMEONE S TOO CLOSE
OUTSIDE MIRRORS ARE IN AVERY BAD LOCATION CREATING BLIND SPOTS ON MAKING TURNS
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE LARGER THAN I WOULD PREFER THEREFORE CREATING A LARGER BLIND SPOT THAT ONE WOULD EXPECT
DON T LIKE THE EXTRA BLIND SPOT MIRROR
COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER VEHICLES THAT I DROVE THIS ONE IS A MUCH EASIER TO SEE OUT OF ESPECIALLY FROM THE REAR AFTER DRIVING A CHEVROLET MALIBU FOR A FEW MONTHS WHILE CAR SEARCHING GRANDMOTHER S CAR THE INTERIOR VISIBILITY IS EXCE
TINTED WINDOWS ARE VERY HELPFUL WHEN DRIVING THROUGH TOWN AT NIGHT LESS INTERFERENCE WITH ALL THOSE NEON LIGHTS
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT OVER THE DRIVERS SHOULDER AND LOOKING TO THE RIGHT FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT THAT IS WHY I USE MY MIRRORS AMD LOVE THE LANE CHANGING WARNING SYSTEM
BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BAD
I FIND THE AUTO DECELERATION WHEN USING CRUISE CONTROL PART OF FORWARD COLLISION WARNING TO BE ENGAGING RATHER EARLY
SOME SAY REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR THROUGH SMALL REAR WINDOWS BUT I FEEL THIS IS TYPICAL OF THIS BODY STYLE AND I HAVE ALWAYS CHECKED THE REAR AS I BACK OUT OF DRIVEWAY
I FEEL THAT I HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
BLIND SPOT IS MORE EASILY VISIABLE THAN ON MY OLD CAR
LANE DEPARTURE WARNING IS AUDIBLE TOO OFTEN WHEN I AM ABOUT TO MAKE A LANE CHANGE I TEND TO TURN ON MY TURN SIGNAL AS THE CAR NEXT TO ME IS DIRECTLY TO MY SIDE AND THEN LANE CHANGE AFTER THEY PASS BUT THE LANE DEPARTURE SYSTEM BEEPS LOUDLY THE
I LOVE DRIVING THIS CAR IT HANDLES CURVES EXCEPTIONALLY WELL AND FOR A 4 CYLINDER HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SPEED FOR ME I CAN SEE OUT OF THE SIDE WINDOWS VERY WELL THE BACKUP CAMERA IS PERFECT I REALLY FEEL MORE SAFE WITH THAT CAMERA
THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM AND THE REAR BACK UP  COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM AS INSTALLED ON OUR VEHICLE IS A MUST FOR THE SANTA FE DESIGN WE LOVE THEM AND USE THEM ALWAYS
REAR VIEW MIRRORS SOMETIMES CAN BE IN A BAD SPOT TO MOVE OUT IN TRAFFIC
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN CHECKING MY BLIND SPOTS IT IS BETTER IN THE VERSION OF THE SONATA THAN MY PREVIOUS SONATA BUT THE PANEL BETWEEN THE DRIVER SIDE DOORS IS STILL A LITTLE WIDE AND BLOCKS MY VIEW A BIT BUT I DO LOVE THE BLIND
FACTORY INSTALLED WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT WORK WELL ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR HAS A CAMERA ON IT THAT INTERACTS WITH THE TOUCH SCREEN TO SHOW MY BLINDSPOT THE VIDEO REALLY DISTRACTS ME AND I FEEL LIKE I CANT TRUST IT I FEEL MORE SAFE LOOKING IN THE ACTUAL MIRROR
THE ONLY REAL VISIBILITY ISSUE IS DUE TO THE SHAPE OF THE C PILLARS WHEN YOU ARE IN A PARKING LOT AND TRYING TO SEE IF ANYONE IS COMING BEHIND THE VEHICLES PARKED ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU THE FAT C PILLARS BLOCK VISIBILITY OF A LARGE AREA THAT SEEM
OVERALL VERY GOOD VISIBILITY ALL AROUND THE CAR WHEN DRIVING
VARIABLE INTERMITTENT WINDSHIELD WIPERS SHOULD BE STANDARD FOR ALL TRIM LEVELS
I M SHORT SO VISIBILITY IS ALWAYS AN ISSUE I WOULD LIKE MORE THAN 3 CHOICES FOR VARIABLE WIPERS
IT DOES HAVE A BLIND SPOT OR TWO WHICH IS ESPECIALLY NOTICIBLE WHEN MERGING INTO TRAFFIC
I AM VERY SATISFIED WITH THE VISIBILITY AND SAFETY FEATURES IT DOES GIVE THE SECURITY THAT I REQUIRE
SPEEDOMETER IS OBSTRUCTED BY STEERING WHEEL
I TURN TO LOOK OUT OF WINDOWS WHEN CHANGING LANES TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS WITH WINDOW LOCATIONS I DO NOT LIKE TO RELY ON MIRRORS ONLY WHEN CHANGING LANES
I DO FIND IT A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW SO THE BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL BUT I DON T KNOW IF ITS JUST BECAUSE I M SHORT OR THAT IT S BECAUSE I WAS USED TO THE CRV
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH MY HONDA CIVIC I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE A BETTER WARNING SYSTEM WHEN GETTING TOO CLOSE TO AN OBJECT OR OTHER CAR
I AM REALLY IMPRESSED BY THE VISIBILITY OF THE WINDOWS THEY ARE VERY BIG AND I CAN SEE AROUND THE WHOLE VEHICLE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE FOUND IS THAT BECAUSE THE WINDOWS ARE SO BIG I HAVE HAD A HARD TIME FINDING A VISOR TO FIT THAT SIZE WINDOW MY
WITH ALL THE HIGH TECH GADGETS INCLUDED HOW COULD HONDA NOT PROVIDE AN AN AUDIBLE WARNING SYSTEM WHEN VEHICLE IS IN REVERSE GEAR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA DOES NOT PROVIDE AN ACCURATE INDICATION OF PROXIMITY TO WALL OR OTHER OBSTRUCTION A ELECTRONIC
SMALLER BLIND SPOT MIRRORS WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION TO THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
I WISH THERE WAS THE SIDE MIRRORS COULD SEE THE BLIND SPOTS A LITTLE BIT BETTER OR SHOW THE NEXT LANES ON EACH SIDE BETTER
THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL ALL OF THE FEATURES MAKE DRIVING SAFER
I WOULD REALLY LIKE DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS AND AUTOMATIC REAR HATCH CLOSING
PUT BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON CAR
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHECKING TO CHANGE LANES
VISIBILITY OUT OF REAR WINDOW FROM DRIVER SEAT COULD BE BETTER BUT IS FINE WHEN USING IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BACK UP CAMERAS
I WOULD HAVE LIKED DAY TIME RUNNING LIGHTS I LIKE TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON AUTO BUT WHEN IT RAINS THE HEAD LIGHTS DON T ALWAYS TURN ON I HAVE TO TURN THEM ON MANUALLY
BACK UP CAMERA IS LOW QUALITY HAVE A HD MONITOR AND LOW DEF CAMERA I CLEAN THE CAMERA ALL THE TIME BUT QUALITY IS LESS THAN WHAT I EXPECT
THE CAMERAS AND SENSORS HELP VISIBILITY PROBLEMS
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE INSTALLED SIDE CAMERAS TOO
THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM IS GREAT1
LOVE THE THIRD ROW SEATING BUT IT LIMITS THE VISIBILITY
LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SHOULD BE STANDARD IN ALL CARS
THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA SYSTEM IS AMAZING
CANNOT SEE OVER FRONT QUARTER PANELS SO RELY HEAVILY ON CAMERA TRUNK SEEMS VERY HIGH DIFFICULT TO LIFT HEAVY ITEMS INTO TRUNK
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO HAVE AN EXTENSION OF THE SUN VISOR IN MY M45 I HAD AN EXTENSION TO COVER THE GAP BETWEEN THE VISOR AND REAR VIEW MIRROR
BLIND SPOTS VISIBILITY OF VEHICLES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE ARE OFTEN WITHIN A BLIND SPOT AREA DANGEROUS IF YOU RELY ON MIRRORS ALONE CARS CAN BE NEXT TO YOU AND MIRRORS WILL NOT ALLOW YOU VISIBILITY
I THINK THE BACK UP WARNING SENSOR SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL INFINITIES OUR HAD A CAMERA AND WARNING SENSOR THIS ONLY HAS THE CAMERA I MISS IT
I WOULD PREFER THAT MY REAR VIEW MIRROR DID NOT AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THE NIGHT TIME VISION THING I PREFER NORMAL VIEW OUT OF MY REAR VIEW MIRROR I AM CONSTANTLY TURNING THE MODE OFF
NEEDS STANDARD DRL TURNING SIGNALS ON SIDE MIRRORS AUTO FOLDING OF SIDE MIRRORS MORE STANDARD EQUIPMENT IN THE VEHICLE FOR THE STICKER PRICE NOT SUCH A TECH SAVY VEHICLE
THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE REMARKABLE NOTHING HAS BEEN LEFT OUT
DID NOT REALIZE I DIDN T HAVE A REAR WIPER AT TIME OF PURCHASE
I HAVE EXPERIENCED ZERO BLIND SPOTS
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVE BEST ABOUT MY CAR IS THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS THEY WORK SO WELL IT REALLY IS A SIMPLE THING BUT I VE HAD ISSUES WITH WIPERS IN THE PAST AND MY INFINITI S WIPERS ARE THE BEST EVER
YOU NEED TO PUT A BEEPING SIGNAL ON BACK UP CAMERA
I MISS THE BACKUP SONAR THAT MY G37 HAD
I DON T HAVE THIS FEATURE I WANTED BLIND SPOT MONITOR FEATURE FOR MY Q40
REAR VIEW CAMERA IS OUTSTANDING AND HAS A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON IMPROVING REAR VISIBILITY
CAR LACKS CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT AS IN OTHER UPSCALE AUTOS
GREAT CAR HOWEVER WORSE FEATURE IS MAJOR SIDE BLIND SPOTS
NOT SURPRISING BUT GIVEN THE STYLING OF THE COUPE SEEING OUT THE READER WHILE DRIVING IS A BIT CHALLENGING I WISH I HAD REAR CAMERAS THAT IS AN OPTION BUT NOT INSTALLED ON THE VEHICLE I PURCHASED
JUST FEELS CHEAP ON JAGUAR S PART TO BUILD AN $80 000 CAR WITH NO STANDARD BACK UP CAMERA OR OTHER PARKING SENSORS BLIND SPOT MONITORS AS JAGUAR IS NOT A HIGH VOLUME BRAND SO FINDING CARS WITH PACKAGES YOU MAY WANT NOT VERY EASY
THE CAR SHOULD HAVE A BACKUP CAMERA STANDARD
WE PURCHASED OUR XF FOR A FAMILY CAR BECAUSE OF ITS SAFETY FEATURES AND RATINGS
OVERALL IT S FANTASTIC BUT THE SUN VISORS ARE LAUGHABLE THEY RE TINY LITTLE MINIATURE THINGS THAT ARE JUST HILARIOUS LOOKING OUT OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR DOESN T SHOW MUCH EXCEPT HEADLIGHTS VERY MINIMAL VISIBILITY BUT IF YOU RE AN ACTIVE DRIVE
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR S FIELD OF VIEW IS TOO CONFINED ALMOST TUNNEL LIKE
A BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM IS A MUST WITH THIS VEHICLE
HUGE BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR QUARTERS
OVERALL VISIBILITY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED
I WISH I HAD AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS HAVE HAD IN PREVIOUS VEHICLES AND HAD TO REMIND MYSELF TO TURN ON LIGHTS MANUALLY
FAR TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING
VISIBILITY FROM THE REAR MIRRORS COULD BE BETTER IF THERE WAS A DOUBLE MIRROR TO SEE ALL BLIND SPOTS
THE FRONT HEADRESTS DONT GO DOWN FAR ENOUGH INTO THE SEAT WHICH HINDERS SOME VISIBILITY FOR DRIVER LOOKING BACKWARDS
SIDE REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SIDE OF THE VEHICLE COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER I LIKE TO LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER A LITTLE TO MAKE SURE NO VICHLE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT AND SOMETIMES ALL I CAN SEE IS THE DOOR FRAME
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT FEATURE
AS A CONVERTIBLE REAR VISIBILITY IS IMPAIRED BUT NO WORSE THAN ANY OTHER CONVERTIBLE I HAVE OWNED
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER S SEAT IS NOT THAT WIDE OPEN
ALL THE BUILT IN SAFETY WARNINGS ARE TERRIFIC AND EASILY GET ADDICTIVE IN A GOOD SENSE
BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVER SEAT ON DRIVER SIDE IS QUITE PROMINENT
FRONT WINDOW POST CREATES A LARGE BLINDSPOT
THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROW NEEDS AN ADDITION FOR THE BLIND SPOT WHEN A VEHICAL IS APPROCHING FROM THE REAR AND IT IS NO LONGER IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROW INSIDE THE VEHICAL THERE IS A BLIND SPOT
BECAUSE OF THE LARGE SIZE OF THE FRONT ROOF SUPPORTS WITH AIR BAGS AND PLACEMENT OF THE SIDE MIRRORS IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE BLIND SPOTS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT
THERE IS A SIDE BLIND SPOT
LIKE MY GRAND CHEROKEE LIMITED THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT ALTHOUGH BETTER BLINDSPOT AROUND THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN ESPECIALLY INTO A SINGLE LANE LIKE A PARKING LOT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE ROAD OR POSSIBLY THE
VERY HARD TO SEE WHEN TURNING LEFT OUT OF THE WINDOW FROM A BLIND SPOT
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS FOR SURE THE FRONT CORNERS OF THE WINDSHIELD AND THE SIDES OF THE REAR WINDOW
I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS COMING IN MY BLIND SPOT
THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS CAUSE SOME BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
I WISH I HAD PURCHASED THE AUTOMATIC HIGH LOW BEAM AND THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS I HAD THEM IN MY OLD JEEP AND NOW I MISS THEM
FOR A LARGE SUV MY VISIBILITY IS NEVER AN ISSUE
REAR CAMERA IS SUPER CLEAR
EVERY CAR HAS BLIND SPOTS SAME HERE
WHEN BACKING UP OR CHANGING LANES I FOUND THERE TO BE WAY TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS FROM THE FRONT CORNER WHEN LOOKING FORWARD TO HEN BACKING UP THE WIDE HEAD RESTS AND THE BACK CORNER I FIND MYSELF TRIPLE CHECKING AND LEANING OVER TO LOOK AROUND
PREFERRED THE HALOGEN XEON RUNNING LIGHTS ON OUR JEEP OUR IS OK BUT PREFERRED THE OTHER
A BACK UP CAMERA WAS INSTALLED DUE TO THE LACK OF VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING THE JEEP UP
THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT DUE TO THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN TURNING ESPECIALLY AT 4 WAY STOP SIGNS
THE DRIVER S SIDE SUN VISOR DOES NOT EXTEND FAR ENOUGH BACK TO COMPLETELY BLOCK THE SUN THROUGH THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW OTHER THAN THAT FLAWLESS
HEAD RESTS BLOCK VIEW SOMETIMES RIGHT HAND VIEW SOMETIMES BLOCKED BY DOOR POST AND HEAD REST AT SAME TIME MAKING ONCOMING TRAFFIC FROM THE RIGHT HARD TO VERIFY JUDGING EXTENT OF FRONT WHEEL AND FENDER DISTANCE WHILE TURNING AND PARKING IS EXCEPT
LARGER WIPE AREA ON REAR WINDOR CHEAP WIPER BLADE SMALL CLEARANCE WHEN USED
THE ONLY OVERALL PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE JEEP IS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IT DOESN T MATTER HOW I ADJUST THE SEAT I SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BEING A BLIND SPOT
BETTER HEADLIGHT BULBS AND BETTER SUN VISORS
POOR VISIBILITY LOOKING THROUGH THE INTERIOR AT OTHER TRAFFIC
DON T LIKE THE BLIND SPOTS
THE BLIND SPOT IN THIS CAR ARE TERRIBLE
ALL THE AIRBAGS AND ALL WINDOWS VERY VISIBLE
BAD BLIND SPOTS ON DRIVERS SIDE
THE REAR SPOILER THAT SPLITS THE TWO GLASS PANELS DISTRACTS THE DRIVER S VIEW NOTHING HORRIBLE BUT IT ALWAYS NOTICEABLE THE VELOSTER TURBO SHOULD COME WITH HID HEADLIGHTS THE HALOGEN BULBS ARE VERY OLD TECHNOLOGY FOR A CAR OF THIS CLASS I CH
I KNOW YOU CANT HAVE A COOL PROFILE AND SEE PERFECTLY I WISH THIS CAR CAME WITH MANDATORY SAFETY WARNING SYSTEMS IN THE MIRROR IT S HARD TO SEE OUT OF IT INSTEAD OF CHANGING THE PERFECT WAY IT LOOKS PUT THIS FEATURE IN BECAUSE IT CAN BE SCARY O
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME NOTIFICATION WHEN A CAR IS IN MY BLIND SPOT
WISH THERE WERE XENON HID HEADLIGHTS BLIND SPOTS ARE A TAD LARGE
VISIBILITY FROM THE REAR SIDES IS REALLY BAD NON EXISTENT
THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT PASSENGER SIDE REAR WHEN CHANGING LANES OR LOOKING OVER RIGHT SHOULDER
LIKE I SAID IN MY LAST STATEMENT THE CAR NEEDS TO HAVE PRIVACY GLASS INSTALLED ON THE BACK GLASS DUE TO NIGHT DRIVING THE CARS THAT COME UP BEHIND ME I HAVE TO ALWAYS LOWER MY REAR VIEW MIRROR TOO BLINDING
NOT USE TO TINTED WINDOWS SOMETHING I AM HAVING TROUBLE ADJUSTING TOO
I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT WHEN I AM IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE AND CARS ARE APPROACHING IN THE PASSING LANE
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS VERY CONVENIENT AND MAKES DRIVING A LARGER VEHICLE MUCH SAFER
VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW IS SOMEWHAT IMPEDED BY THE STYLING AND SMALL REAR WINDOW
MY HYUNDAI TUCSON IS NOT REAL EASY FOR ME TO SEE OUT OF WHEN LOOKING TO THE REAR I AM SHORT FOR ONE THING AND THE WIDE REAR SUPPORTS BLOCK MY VISIBILITY
THREE ARE BLIND SPOTS BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT TO THE REAR OF THE DRIVER WINDSHIELD POSTS ALSO CAUSE A BLIND SPOT ON EACH SIDE LOOKING FORWARD
LOVE ALL THE EXTRA GLASS IN THE REAR HATCH MAKES VISABILITY MUCH BETTER HEADLIGHTS ARE CLEAR WHITE BRIGHT SUPERB
I *ESPECIALLY* APPRECIATED THE ADDITION OF A BLIND SPOT MIRROR TO THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR MY VELOSTER LACKED THIS SIMPLE FIX AND ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION I ALMOST RAN INTO A CAR HANGING OUT IN MY BLIND SPOT REGARDLESS OF PHYSICALLY TURN
PREVIOUS COMMENT REGARDING BLOCKAGE OF PEDESTRIAN LANE CYCLIST FROM A PILLAR LOOK AT A TOYOTA VENZA FOR A SOLUTION
THERE ARE NUMEROUS BLIND SPOTS IN THE FRONT AND REAR
THIS IS CLEARLY THE GREATEST WEAKNESS OF THE R SPEC REAR VISIBILITY ISN T THAT GREAT AND THE C PILLAR ON THE RIGHT IS LARGE ENOUGH THAT IT WILL LITERALLY CREATE A HUGE BLINDSPOT TWO LANES TO THE RIGHT OF THE VEHICLE AND NEITHER MIRRORS NOR LOOKI
THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BECAUSE THE HEADRESTS RISE UP SO FAR AND THE DRIVER S SEAT IS SO LOW
THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT ON THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE DANGEROUS WHEN CHANGING LANES THERE IS LITERALLY NO WAY TO SEE EVEN A LARGE VEHICLE IN THAT BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY OUT REAR WINDOW IS VERY GOOD BUT SPOILER DOES CAUSE A SLIGHT HINDER VISIBILITY
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE CAR IS DESIGNED IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW USING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I AM 6 FOOT AND MY EYE LINE WHEN LOOKING IN THE MIRROR IS DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH THE REAR INTERIOR ROOF A FRIEND WHO IS SHORTER DID NOT HAVE T
IT IS HARD TO ALIGN REAR VIEW MIRROR WITH REAR WINDOW MIRROR SHOULD BE LOCATED LITTLE LOWER OR SHOULD HAVE BETTER RANGE OF ADJUSTMENT
REAR WINDOW IS TOO SMALL HAS SIGNIFICANT BLINDSPOTS
HEADREST FOR BACK SEATS MAKE REAR ANGLE VISIBILITY TOUGH AT TIMES
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR
THE VEHICLES BLIND SPOTS AREN T THAT GREAT AND HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING SOMETIMES WHEN CHANGING LANES
THERE IS A BLINDSIDE
DUE TO HIGH HEAD RESTS AND WIDE B AND C PILLARS THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT FOR ME I WOULD NOT PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE AGAIN WITHOUT LANE DETECTION
LARGE BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR ON THE SIDES AND BAR IN THE MIDDLE OF BACK WINDOW
REAR VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR
LIKE THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR COULD USE AN INTEGRATED CONVEX MIRROR FOR BETTER VISIBILITY ALONG PASSENGER SIDE REAR QUARTER PANEL AREA
THE REAR SPOILER SEVERELY IMPAIRS LOOKING BEHIND YOU HOWEVER IT DOES HAVE A REAR VIEW CAMERA TO HELP COMPENSATE FOR THAT THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR HAS A CONVEX LENS WHICH GREATLY HELPS LOOKING TO YOUR SIDE BECAUSE ITS HARD TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT
REAR PILLARS CAUSE MASSIVE BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE
THIS CAR HAS LITTLE BLIND SPOTS I LIKE BEING ABLE TO SEE ALL AROUND ME
I DON T KNOW IF IT S JUST ME I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE MIRRORS CAN SHOW CARS THAT ARE DRIVING JUST TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT AND SLIGHTLY LAGGING BEHIND MY PACE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY ON THE LEFT SIDE
THE SIDE VISIBILTY OF FROM THE DRIVER SEAT IS NOT VERY GOOD IT IS VERY EASY TO HAVE A CAR IN YOUR BLIND SPOT AND THE BLIND SPOT SEEMS VERY LARGE
I FEEL THAT BACK UP CAMERA S BLIND SPOT INDICATORS SHOULD BE STANDARD IN EVERY VECHICLE IT SHOULD NOT BE A SPECIAL PRICE FOR THOSE FEATURES
PASSENGERS SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADE IS ONLY LIKE 12 INCHES LONG LOOKS FUNNY
3RD KIA THE LANE CHANGE ALARM IS HUGE FOR BLIND SPOT ISSUE
LEFT SIDE OF THE CAR BLIND SPOT IS HORRIBLE THE RIGHT SIDE ISNT AS BAD THE OPTION FOR THE BLIND SPOT SENSOR SHOULD COME STANDARD IF THE PROBLEM IS NOT CORRECTED
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE NOT EASY TO CHECK DUE TO THE SMALL SIDE REAR WINDOWS AND LARGE CORNER POSTS
LESS BLIND SPOTS
AS WITH ANY CAR THERE IS A BLIND SPOT POSITIONING THE MIRRORS MINIMIZES THIS
BLIND SPOT MIRRORS SHOULD BE ADDED OR COLLITION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
SOMEHOW THE WINDOWS LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A LAYER OF PLASTIC ON THEM THAT IS SEPARATING AND THIS LOOK IS REDUCING THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE WINDOWS
IT S IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE OUT THE DRIVER S BACK & SIDE WINDOWS WHEN BACKING UP BECAUSE OF THE HEAD REST I M THANKFUL FOR THE REAR CAMERA OR I D PROBABLY GET IN AN ACCIDENT
REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED
YOU DO HAVE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE LEFT I LOOK TWICE
I AM ONLY 5 2 AND SOMETIMES THE BLIND SPOTS ARE TRICKY AND WHEN THE ANGLE OF THE SUN IS LOW ENOUGH I HAVE TO RAISE MYSELF UP A BIT BUT I THINK THE CAR IS DESIGNED WELL WITH AVERAGE HEIGHT FOLKS IN MIND AND I AM OKAY WITH THAT
MORE BLIND SPOTS THAN YOU WOULD THINK FOR A LITTLE CAR
I DO WISH THAT THIS CAR HAD A REAR CAMERA FOR BACKING UP AND REMOTE START
MY FIRST EVER BRAND U CAR OF THE LOT N I LOVE IT SO FAR LOL IT DOESN T HAVE ALL THE COOL GADGETS I COULDN T AFFORD IT WISH I COULD THO
TRICKY BLIND SPOT I M HAVING TO GET USE TO
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AND HEADLIGHTS
POOR VISIBILITY THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR DUE TO SPARE TIRE AND REAR WIPER MOTOR
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY FROM ALL ASPECTS
ALL AROUND VISIBILITY IS AMAZING
THE VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING FOR THE DRIVER WHEN I M THE PASSENGER THERE IS LIMITED SEAT ADJUSTMENTS SO IT MAKES VISIBILITY DIFFICULT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE
REAR VISIBILITY IS LIMITED BUT THIS IS A COMPROMISE FOR EXTRA TRUNK SPACE WHICH I LIKE
I FEEL THE HEADLIGHTS ESPECIALLY THE LOW BEAM IS NOT THAT BRIGHT AND COULD POSSIBLY BE IMPROVED BY EITHER USE OF A DIFFERENT TYPE OF LAMP OR MAYBE ADJUSTING THE LIGHT UNIT ITSELF I DO NOT FEEL THE VISIBILITY ON BRIGHT IS A BAD BUT ON LOW I J
THERE S A BIG BLIND SPOT IN THE REAR THIRD OF THE VEHICLE BUT THE BACK UP CAMERA IS HELPFUL FOR THAT
EXCELLENT FOLD OUT OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY POOR WHEN WIPERS NEEDED TOO SMALL AN AREA IS CLEARED
OUTSIDE MIRRORS SHOULD HAVE THE BLIND SPOT VIEW SHOULD HAVE THE AUTO LIGHTS AND NOT HAVE THEM ON ALL TIME TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE ON IN THE EVENING
AS USUAL BLIND SPOTS ARE AN ISSUE BUT THAT IS ON MOST CARS I DO HAVE THE WARNING SYSTEM AND IT WORKS GREAT
WHEN LOOKING OVER THE RIGHT SHOULDER FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT VISIBILITY IS LIMITED
THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT HEAD REST AND THE DOOR PILLAR LINE UP IN SUCH A WAY AS TO CREATE A LARGER THAN NORMAL BLIND SPOT I CAN LESSEN THE SIZE OF THE BLIND SPOT BY MOVING THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT ALL THE WAY FORWARD
IF I M MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN I DON T REALLY FEEL THAT I HAVE A GOOD VISIBILITY FROM THE LEFT
BLIND SPOTS TOOOO BIG IN REAR CORNERS
SUN VISOR BLOCKS A PORTION OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
GOOD VISIBILITY EXCEPT OUT REAR WINDOW WHICH IS SMALL
THE BLIND SPOT IN THE DRIVER S SIDE REAR MIRROR SEEMS LARGER THAN WHAT I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO ON PREVIOUS VEHICLES
SOME VISIBILITY ISSUES WHEN LOOKING OUT OF THE SIDE REAR WINDOWS BECAUSE OF WINDOW DESIGN
HANDLES GREAT VISIBILITY GREAT
I WISH THE BLIND SPOT FEATURE WAS STANDARD OR AVAILABLE WITHOUT HAVING TO BUY THE EX PACKAGE
REAR SEAT HEADRESTS NEED ABILITY TO BE REMOVED FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
I WISH IT HAD RUNNING LIGHTS
ITS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR SIDES DUE TO SHAPE OF VEHICLE AND POSITIONING OF REAR LIGHTS THAT SPACE TAKES UP ROOM THAT COULD BE USED FOR VISIBILITY DUE TO THE LIGHTS ARE IN THE UPPER PART OF THE VEHICLE INSTEAD OF ON THE BOTTOM
BEING A SHORT PERSON 5 3 I HAVE A LITTLE DIFFICULTY SEEING OVER THE DOOR LOOKING TOWARD THE GROUND BECAUSE THE BELTLINE IS PRETTY HIGH ALSO AS WITH MOST VEHICLES LIKE THIS THE SMALL REAR SIDE WINDOW DOES NT HELP VISIBILITY PROPERLY ADJUSTED
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS BLOCK VISIBILITY OF LANE MARKERS WHEN TURNING LEFT
BLIND SPOT IS HORRIBLE
SINCE REAR CAMERAS BEGAN APPEARING IN CARS THE VISABILITY FROM REAR WINDOWN HAS DECLINED I PURCHASED THE KIA SOUL BECAUSE I WANT TO USE MY EYES ASWELL AS THE REAR CAMERA
IT FEELS SOLID AND SAFE IT IS EASY TO SEE ALL AROUND WHILE DRIVING AND IT IS FULLY LOADED WITH AIRBAGS
AS YOU GET OLDER IT GETS HARDER TO TURN TO LOOK BEHIND YOU THE BACKUP CAMERA HELPS WITH THIS I FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE
REAR HEADRESTS INTERFERE WITH REAR VIEW VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT OUTSIDE REAR PASSENGER SIDE
THERE ARE TO MANY BLIND SPOTS AND NOT ENOUGH VISABILITY ASPECTS
BAD BLINDSPOT DUE TO DRIVER SIDE MIRROR
THERE ARE MANY BLIND SPOTS WITH THE DESIGN OF THE SPORTAGE OVERALL THIS IS THE ONLY THING I AM UNHAPPY WITH
I WISH THERE WAS THE OPTION OF HAVING ELECTRONIC COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS I WAS TOLD THIS WAS NOT AN OPTION IN THIS STYLE VEHICLE MY FATHER WHO ALSO LEASES A KIA OPTIMA WAS ABLE TO OBTAIN THESE OPTIONS IN HIS VEHICLE YET THE SOUL DOES NOT
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR
I WOULD LIKE A LITTLE WIDER RANGE FOR THE HEADLIGHTS
I NOTICED I HAVE A BLIND SPOT TURNING RIGHT ONTO A ROAD 130 TURN
ALL SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL
THE VERY BOTTOM ABOUT 1 5 INCHES OF THE WINDSHIELD HAS A DISTORTED VIEW IT IS MOST NOTICEABLE WHEN USING THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE THE SAFETY OF SOLID CONSTRUCTION THE FRONT DOOR FRAMES ARE A LITTLE WIDE REDUCING VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT IS TERRIBLE NO MATTER HOW YOU MOVE YOUR MIRRORS REAR HEADREST BLOCKS A LOT OF THE BACK WINDOW HAD TO LOWER REAR HEADRESTS TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE OUT THE BACK WINDOW
I FEEL THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT I WISH THE BACK WINDOW WAS A LITTLE BIGGER I FEEL VERY SAFE WHILE I AM DRIVING THE CAR FEELS SOLID AND SMOOTH
LARGE BLIND SPOT OUT OF BACK WINDOW WHEN LOOKING IN REAR VIEW MIRROR BACK SEATS COME UP VERY HIGH AND THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL I USE MY SIDE MIRRORS MORR TO GET VISIBILITY OF WHAT IS BEHIND ME
WINDOWS ARE LARGE AND VISIBILITY IS EXCEPTIONAL IN THIS VEHICLE
WOULD LIKE BETTER CAMERA RESOLUTION
OUTSTANDING VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER AND FRONT PASSENGER SEAT IT S ONE OF OUR MOST FAVORITE ASPECTS OF THE VEHICLE
REAR HEAD REST FOR CENTER REAR SEAT REDUCES VISIBILITY WHEN USING REAR VIEW MIRROR
SITS HIGH GOOD VISIBILITY NICE RIDE
THE REAR WINDOW IS RELATIVELY SMALL NOT GIVING GREAT VISABILITY
THERE IS A VERY BAD BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT PASSENGENER SIDE
VISIBILITY GOOD EXCEPT WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES
HEADLIGHTS ARE TOO BRIGHT IT COULD BE A SAFETY ISSUE FOR OTHER DRIVERS
THE LANE DEPARTURE AVOIDANCE ALARMS CAN BE A BIT TRYING ON NARROW LANES OF TRAVEL OVER LONG DISTANCES HOWEVER THE OCCASIONAL ANNOYANCE IS PREFERABLE GIVEN THE ALTERNATIVE OF ATTEMPTING TO OCCUPY THE SAME SPACE AS ANOTHER VEHICLE
I WOULD LIKE THOSE EXTRA SMALL REAR VIEW MIRRORS THAT REDUCE THE BLIND SPOT
BACK WINDOW IS SMALL WHICH LIMITS VIEW AND INCREASES BLIND SPOTS
REAR SEAT HEADRESTS OBSTRUCT REAR VISIBILITY AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE FOLDED OR RETRACTED
ITS GOT HUGE BLIND SPOTS AND AS MENTIONED SEVERAL TIMES VERY LIMITED REAR VIEWING DUE TO HEADRESTS AND SPARE TIRE SIZE
WHEN SOFT TOP IS DOWN IT PREVENTS GOOD VISIBILITY IN REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS LIMITED DUE TO REAR TIRE BACK UP CAMERA WOULD RESOLVE THIS HEADLIGHTS WAS REPORTED IN PREVIOUS PART OF SURVEY BUT NOT DEFECTED THEY ARE NOT UP TO MY PERSONAL REQUIREMENTS AFTERMARKET LIGHTS HAVE BEEN INSTALLED
THE FACT THE DO NOT OFFER BACK UP CAMERA OF BACK UP SENSOR WITH THE TIRE IN BACK IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE BEHIND JEEP
HARD TO SEE BLIND SPOT LOCATIONS FROM DRIVERS SEAT
LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY
REAR HEADRESTS BLOCK A LOT OF REAR VIEW
REAR CAMERA HAS NO WAY TO JUDGE HOW CLOSE YOU ARE UNTIL YOU HIT SOMETHING
I HAVE ENCOUNTERED MANY BLIND SPOTS WHICH COULD HAVE RESULTED IN ACCIDENTS
I ADDED SMALL RECTANGULAR BLIND SPOT MIRRORS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE DRIVER AND PASSENGER MIRRORS AND HAVE ELIMINATED THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS THAT I HAVE TO OVERCOME
REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY COULD BE BETTER
IT HAS A LARGE BLIND SPOT IN THE REAR CORNER AND MAKES IT HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES
REAR VIEW CAMERA STANDARD ON ALL VEHICLES
JUST A PERSONAL DISLIKE I DON T LIKE THE OBJECTS ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR RIGHT REAR VIEW MIRROR
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO LOOK RIGHT AND BEHIND
BACKUP CAMERA WITH VARIED OPTIONS IS A GREAT PACKAGE FEATURE
HEADLIGHTS SEEM DIM WITH OTHER PERIPHERAL LIGHTS IN AREA I DON T LIKE THE 911 BUTTON LOCATED SO CLOSE TO THE REAR VIEW MIRROR S NIGHT LEVER ONE NIGHT I WENT TO FLIP THE MIRROR TO NIGHT TIME AND ACCIDENTLY PUSHED THE 911 BUTTON AND DIDN T KNOW
I DO WISH IT HAD THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IN IT
VERY FEW BLIND SPOTS TO CAUSE LOSS OF VISION FIELDS
THERE ARE SOME LARGE BLIND SPOTS AT THE FRONT LEFT AND RIGHT AND THE BACK CORNERS
REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS
REAR CAMERA SHOULD HAVE BEEN STANDARD
VEHICLE HAS MAJOR BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO LOOK OVER LEFT SHOULDER WHEN DRIVING REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS OKAY WHEN USING MIRRORS BUT THERE IS STILL ALWAYS A BLIND SPOT
REAR VISIBILITY IS ROUGH AT BEST
I DO NOT HAVE THE COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM THE BACKUP CAMERA IS VERY MISLEADING OBJECTS LOOK WAY FURTHER AWAY THAN THEY ARE I ROUTINELY CHECK THIS AND FIND I AM INCHED AWAY FROM OBJECTS WALLS OTHER CARS AND IN THE BACKUP CAMERA IT APPEARS I
DO NOT LIKE THE WAY THE REAR CAMERA DISPLAYS THOUGHT I D GET USED TO IT BUT DID NOT AS YET
GOOD VISABLITY
VISIBILITY FROM SIDE MIRRORS IS GREAT VIEW FROM BACK WINDOW IS LIMITED IN THE HATCHBACK
THE SENSORS THAT ALERT YOU TO CARS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL AS WELL AS THE PARKING SENSORS OR CARS APPROACHING WHEN YOU ARE BACKING UP THE VEHICLE
I SEEM TO HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING MY BLIND SPOT AND FELT UNCOMFORTABLE AT FIRST RELYING ON MIRROR INDICATOR COULD HAVE TO DO WITH IT BEING VERY NEW FOR ME AND NOW USING ANOTHER METHOD TO CHECK FOR CARS NOT READILY APPARENT I DO LIKE IT BETTER
GREAT VISIBILITY ALWAYS FEEL IN CONTROL AND INFORMED OF SURROUNDINGS
THE PARKING ASSIST SENSORS HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING ON PREVENTING DINGS AND FENDER BENDERS WOULD BE EVEN BETTER IF I HAD THE LANE DEPARTURE AND OTHER FEATURES
THE LED LIGHTS ARE AMAZING I CAN T BELIEVE HOW CLEAR I CAN SEE DOWN ROADS WITH NO STREET LIGHTS THE TELESCOPING PART OF THE SUN VISORS ARE GREAT AS I CAN PULL THE VISOR VERTICALLY TO BLOCK THE SEARING SUN OF THE SUN SHINE STATE
ALL VEHICLES SHOUD BE EQUIPPED WITH AUTOMATIC SAFETY FEATURES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO AVOID COLLISIONS
SIDE MIRRORS ARE ATTACHED TOO FAR TO THE REAR OF THE DOORS MOVING FORWARD WOULD ELIMINATE MORE OF THE BLIND SPOT
I DIDN T OPT FOR THE BLIND SPOT OPTION BUT THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS ON THE GS AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SMART MOVE PERHAPS MAKING THEM STANDARD WOULD BE A SMART WAY TO GO
JUST WISH THE FRONT ROOF POSTS SUPPORTS AND THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS COULD BE SMALLER TO PERMIT GREATER VISIBILITY FORWARD AND REARWARD RESPECTIVELY
RIGHT SIDE EXTERIOR VISIBILITY IS HAMPERED BY TALL PASSENGER HEADRESTS WHEN CHECKING FOR SAFE LANE CHANGE FEEL ALL VEHICLES SHOULD COME WITH LANE DEPARTURE WARNINGS INSTEAD OF IT BEING AN OPTION JUST AS SEATBELTS AND AIRBAGS HAVE BEEN WOULD PA
I BELIEVE I HAVE GOOD ALL AROUND VISIBILITY I FEEL EVEN MORE SECURE WITH THE LANE CHANGING ALERT WARNING SENSORS AND THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE MONITORS WILL THERE BE A ROAD HAZARD DETECTION WARNING SENSOR IN FUTURE MODELS IF SO I WOULD LIKE TO H
OVERALL VERY GOOD VISIBILITY
THE SIDE PANELS OF THE VEHICLE ON THE WINDSHIELD SOMETIMES CAUSES A BLIND SPOT
IT IS A GREAT VEHICLE FOR VISIBILITY SAFETY AND COMFORT
BSM HELPS BUT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT IN REAR I WOULD NOT WANT THE CAR WITHOUT THE BSM
THE REAR WIPER SHOULD BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WINDOW FOR OPTIMUM VISION WHEN IN USE THE LOWER LEFT ISN T CLEAR AND I WOULD RATHER SEE THE LOWER SIDES THAN THE UPPER
I VE ONLY OWNED LEXUS SUVS AND BOUGHT MY DURST ONE IN I HAD AN ACCIDENT THAT TOTALED MY GX IN JAN I VE NEVER FELT AS SAFE IN A CAR ACCIDENT AS I DID IN THIS VEHICLE TWO DRIVER AIRBAGS DEPLOYED AND I ONLY HAD WHIPLASH IN SPITE OF T
BLINDSPOT MONITOR IS WORKING VERY WELL
I WISH I COULD SEE THE NAVIGATION INSTRUCTIONS ON MY DASHBOARD IN FRONT OF ME I FIND IT DISTRACTING TO LOOK TO THE RIGHT I HAD A CAR BMW WHERE THE WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS OR YOUR NEXT TURN WOULD DISPLAY BY LOOKING THROUGH THE STEERING WHEEL BEL
BLIND SPOT MONITORING AWESOME REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT AWESOME BACK UP CAMERA AWESOME
THE REAR WINDOW COMES DOWN IN THE BACK A LITTLE TO LOW FROM WERE I SIT IN THE DRIVERS SEAT COMFORTABLE DRIVING POSITION BUT I HAVE TO STOOP A LITTLE TO SEE IN MIRROR OUT BACK WINDOW REALLY NOT A BIGGY I KNOW IT IS BECAUSE OF HOW I HAVE THE SEAT
SAFETY FEATURES ARE FULLY LOADED
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR SENSOR
I LOVE THAT MY LEXUS TELLS ME WHEN THERE IS ANOTHER CAR IN MY BLIND SPOT
REALLY NICE THE WARNING LIGHTS ON MIRRORS OF ANOTHER CAR IN BLIND SPOT
I THINK THAT LEXUS SHOULD OFFER AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT THE BSM LANCE DEPARTURE ALERT AND PARKING ASSIST YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO UPGRADE AND THEY DON T OFFER MANY OPTIONAL PACKAGES AS STAND ALONE FEATURES THUS REQUIRING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE C
I RELY ON THE WARNING SIGNAL IN THE SIDE MORROWS BECAUSE I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR SYSTEM AND ESPECIALLY THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT
THERE ARE HEADLIGHT WASHERS AS WELL
I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO HAVE A FRONT CAMERA LIKE SOME OTHER VEHICLES AND MEMORY SEATS AND THE SIDE MIRRORS GO IN LIKE THE KIA OPTIMA
I LOVE THE INDICATORS THAT LET YOU KNOW WHEN SOMRTHING IS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT
THERE IS ONLY ONE ISSUE WITH THE CAR AND THAT IS THE FRONT HEADRESTS WHICH TO ME LIMIT VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES I TRADED IN AN OLDER MODEL LEXUS IS WHICH HAD MUCH BETTER PERIPHERAL VISIBILITY THIS IS TRULY THE ONE AND ONLY NEGATIVE I HAV
THE BACKUP CAMERA AREA THAT SHIFTS WHEN THE WHEEL IS TURNED IS TERRIFIC
POBABLY IF THERE WOULD BE ANYTHING OF COCERN IT WOULD BE THE REAR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING
I LOVE THE FEATURE OF THE CHANGE OF THE LANE LIGHTS IN THE SIDE MIRRORS TO WARN OF VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
I LOVE MONITORING OF BLIND SPOT WARNING OF VEHICLES ON SIDES OF CAR
CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM PRESENT SYSTEM IS OK A MORE SOPHISTICATED SHOULD BE AVAILABLE SOON FOR FUTURE OWNERS
REAR VIEW MIRROR IN FRONT OF CAR IS A PROBLEM DO NOT LIKE THE GARARGE DOOR ON THAT MIRROR SOMETIMES WHEN YOU PUSH FOR GARAGE DOOR YOU HAVE MOVED THE MIRROR
FORWARD AND SIDE VISIBILITY ARE VERY GOOD REAR VISIBILITY IS LIMITED BY WINDOW STYLING BACK UP CAMERA HELPS A LOT IN A PARKING LOT SITUATION WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE VERY GOOD THE WINDSHIELD WASHERS ARE BELOW AVERAGE PERHAPS POOR
CHANGING LANES IS DIFFICULT ON THE LEXUS RX 350 THE SIDE WINDOWS ARE TINTED AND THE WINDOW DIVIDERS BLOCK VISIBILITY VISIBILITY FROM THE FRONT IS VERY GOOD BUT I VE ALWAYS FELT THAT SIDE VISIBILITY IS ONLY AVERAGE
REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT
REAR VIEW IS QUITE LIMITED BUT EXTRA LARGE SIDE MIRRORS DO HELP
TO DEVELOP A SIDE SUN VISOR WITHOUT MOVING THE FRONT ONE TO THE SIDE WHILE DRIVING
REAR VISIBILITY COULD BE BETTER
VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES IS BAD BUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS A BIG HELP AND SEEMS TO WORK WELL THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DON T SENSE MOISTURE AND WORK WELL INTERMITTENTLY MY 2004 RX WIPERS WORKED BETTER
REARWARD VISIBILITY IS VERY LIMITED 360 DEGREE CAMERAS WOULD HELP
STILL GETTING USED TO REAR CAMERA
THERE IS SOME DIFFICULTY SEEING OUT OF THE VEHICLE TO THE BACK HOWEVER THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS BACKUP CAMERA AND PARKING ASSIST SOLVE THE PROBLEM COMPLETELY
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON 24 7 WHEN THE CAR IS ON BUT THEY SWITCH TO THE APPROPRIATE LIGHT COLOR DEPENDING ON DAY OR NIGHT THE FRONT LIGHTS HAVE LED LIGHTS THAT TURN WHEN YOU TURN AND PREDICT WHERE YOU ARE GOING BY THE STEERING WHEEL
REAR VIEW CAMERA FEATURES ARE GREAT VISIBILITY TO REAR WITHOUT THEM IS VERY LIMITED
TYPICAL OF MOST COUPES THE VISIBILITY AT THE REAR QUARTERS IS NOT GOOD THE SENSORS HELP WHEN CHANGING LANES
VISIBILITY DIFFICULT WHEN CHANGING LANES ELECTRONIC COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ME
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS THAT COULD BE IMPROVED BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE BACK SIDE WINDOWS
VIEW OF REAR WINDOW IS NOT AS EXPANSIVE FROM DRIVER S SEAT REAR CAMERA IS THE ONLY WAY I FEEL SAFE BACKING OUT
THE VISIBILITY IS QUITE GOOD FOR A COUPE AND THAT S JUST A DECISION THE DESIGN IS QUITE GOOD AND SAFETY FEATURES IMPROVE THE VISIBILITY GREATLY
THE WARNING WHEN A CAR IS IN THE NEXT LANE HAS ALREADY SAVED AN ALMOST CERTAIN WRECK THE VISIBILITY FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS POOR DUE TO THE HEAD RESTS BOTH FRONT AND BACK
SLIGHTLY DIFFICULT FOR FRONT DRIVER S SIDE VISIBILITY
GOOD VISIBILITY NO BLIND SPOTS
LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA AND CURB ALERT AND SIDE WARNING LIGHTS
REAR HEAD RESTRAINTS BLOCK REAR VISIBILITY THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING TO THE FRONT RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THE MIRROR AND SIDE POST BLOCK VISIBILITY
THE REAR VISIBILITY COULD BE A LITTLE BETTER THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS A VALUABLE AID
THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS CAR IS THAT YOU CAN T SEE OUT OF THE RIGHT REAR WINDOW WHEN BACKING UP UNLESS THE PASSENTER SEAT IS MOVED UPWARD I DO USE THE CAMERA BUT I ALSO LIKE TO LOOK
I DON T MIND THE LIMITED VISIBILITY IT IS A SPORTS CAR AFTER ALL I CAN T IMAGINE DRIVING THIS CAR WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM I THINK IT WOULD BE A HUGE SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IF THERE WERE SIDE VIEW CAMERAS THAT SHOWED YOU WHAT WAS O
THE HEADRESTS IN THE REAR SEAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE VISIBILITY FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE REAR WINDOW
A CAMERA ON THE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR WOULD HELP IN CHANGING LANES VERSE THE WARNING ICON IN THE SIDE MIRROR
I HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH BLIND SPOTS IN THIS CAR WHICH I HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED WITH OUR OTHER TWO LEXUS
NO AUTO DIMMING FEATURE
SOMETIMES IT S HARD TO SEE WHEN BACKING BUT REAR CAMERA HELPS OUT A LOT
THE ONLY THING THAT COULD BE BETTER IS THE REAR VISIBILITY BUT IF YOU HAVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA LIKE I DO IT WOULDN T BE A PROBLEM
THE PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT AND REAR BACKING VISIBILITY WITHOUT THE ELECTRONIC AIDS WHICH DO A GREAT JOB WOULD BE TOUGH THE REAR CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM ARE MUST HAVES
LIMITED VISIBILITY OUT REAR SIDE WINDOW WHEN PULLING INTO TRAFFIC
LIKE LANE MANAGEMENT CRASH AVOIDANCE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR
SOMETIMES IT S HARD TO SEE TRAFFIC COMING FROM EITHER SIDE WARNING NOTIFICATION WHEN YOU ARE BACKING UP BECAUSE OF THE STEERING WHEEL
LOVE THE MOVING HEADLIGHTS
IT HAS A VERY BAD BLIND SPOT TO THE RIGHT DUE TO THE SIZE AND POSITION OF THE B PILLAR AND PASSENGER HEAD REST
BLIND SPOT INDICATOR PROVIDES INCREASED FEELING OF SAFETY
REAR CAMERA AND SIDE COLLISION AVOIDANCE ARE BEST FEATURES
AS WITH MOST VEHICLES THERE CAN BE A BLINDSPOT AT THE PASSENGER SIDE A PILLAR WHEN GLANCING TO YOUR RIGHT AT AN INTERSECTION A CAMERA MOUNTED IN THE PASSENGER REARVIEW DOOR MIRROR OR SIDEMARKER LIGHT AREA AND A MONITOR MOUNTED ON THE INSIDE O
REAR WINDOW IS SO SLANTED THE AREA OF VISIBILITY IS LIMITED
I TRULY FEEL SAFE IN THE RC I DON T REALLY FEEL LIKE THERE ARE ANY BLIND SPOTS IT IS UNBELIEVABLE TO HAVE A SPORTY BUT SAFE VEHICLE THE RC IS BEAUTIFULLY CONSTRUCTED TO INVOLVE NOT ONLY LOOKS BUT SAFETY
THE HEAD RESTS ARE SO HIGH THAT THEY TEND TO BE A DISTRACTION IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
REAR VISIBILITY IS LIMITED BUT THAT IS DUE TO THE SPORTS CAR DESIGN
BLIND SPOTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE BUT WING MIRRORS DO HAVE WARNING SYSTEM NOW WHICH MITIGATES
BLIND SPOT WARNING DEFINITELY A PLUS LOW VISIBILITY FROM SMALL BACK GLASS
LOVE THE VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT OUT FRONT WINDOW BLIND SPOT OUTSIDE MIRROR BLOCKS SOME VIEW AND HARD TO SEE IF SOMEONE IS COMING WHEN PULLING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE
THE AUTO SENSOR MAKES UP FOR THE REAR VISIBILITY ISSUE
VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT FOR OVERTAKING TRAFFIC IS POOR BUT THE INSTALLED SAFETY PACKAGE WITH OVERTAKING AND PROXIMITY WARNINGS TENDS TO OFFSET THIS WHICH MAKES IT AN ESSENTIAL OPTION
ROOF SLOPE LOOKS GREAT BUT COMPROMISES VISABLITY
I SEEM TO HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING AROUND REAR HEADRESTS IN ORDER TO JUDGE SAFETY OF CHANGING LANES
REAR VISIBILITY IS LIMITED BUT PROPER MIRROR USE OVERCOMES MY CONCERNS
POOR VISIBILITY LOOKING OUT THE BACK WINDOW
I HAVE TO PUT DOWN THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS FOR OPTIMAL VISIBILITY
NEED A BACK UP WARNING WHEN TOO CLOSE TO AN OBJECT
REAR VIEW MIRROR AND VISORS ARE WAY TOO SMALL
WHEN TURNING INTO A NARROW DRIVEWAY I VE NOT GOTTEN USED TO THE BLIND SPOT CREATED BY THE SIDE MIRRORS
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS SMALL AND WHILE THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE EXCEPTIONAL I STILL FEEL THERE ARE FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDES
THE EXTRA SWIPE BY WINDSHIELD WIPER AFTER WASHING WINDSHIELD IS EXTREMELY ANNOYING AND SMEARS THE WINDSHIELD
I LOVE THE FRONT AND READ CAMERAS AND THE WARNING LIGHTS WHEN SOMEONE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT
OUTSTANDING DRIVING VISIBILITY
I WISH I HAD A BETTER VIEW WHEN BACKING LIKE A REAR CAMERA
THE BLIND SPOT ON EACH SIDE IS LARGER THAN I WOULD PREFER
ROAD FEEL  CONTROL OF CAR FEEL IS SUPERB ENHANCING FEELING OF SAFETY
SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE SMALLER THAN I M USED TO MAKING IT HARD TO CHANGE LANES
I DON T LIKE THE TURNING OF THE WHEEL FOR NAVIGATION ALSO FOR FAVORITES NO AIRPORTS OR MAJOR THINGS LIKE THAT SHOULD HAVE HAD GPS INSTALLED
VISIBILITY IS LIMITED LOOKING TOWARD REAR PASSENGER SIDE
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL AND I LOVE THE SONAR FEATURE THAT BEEPS WHEN I GET TOO CLOSE TO SOMETHING
COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM AND LANE DEPARTURE IS EXCEPTIONAL
FRONT PASSENGER SEAT BLOCKS SIDE REAR VIEW
DESIGN OF VERY SMALL REAR WINDOW RESULTS IN A BLIND SPOT ON SIDE OF VEHICLE
REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE VERY SMALL AND SOMETIMES I DON T FEEL SAFE CHANGING LANES
HEADLIGHT SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLE VISIBILITY IS NEVER AN ISSUE AT NIGHT
GREAT WINDOW SIZE BACK WINDOW AND REAR VISIBILITY
FRONT SUN VISORS DO NOT EXTEND TO COVER LENGTH OF DOOR LEAVING GAP OF SUN PASSING THROUGH WITH LARGE BODY CAR BLIND SPOT DETECTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN STANDARD FEATURE
SIDE OUTSIDE MIRRORS ARE LARGE AND VERY GOOD ALSO THE REARVIEW CAMERA AND ALL AROUND SENSORS ARE USEFUL
MY ONLY MAJOR CRITICISM OF THE X1 IS THE SMALL REAR VIEW WINDOW ON THE LIFT BACK IT REALLY SHOULD BE LARGER GIVE THE SMALL SIZE OF THE REAR QUARTER WINDOWS WITH THE HOFMEISTER KINK
WHEN TURNING IT IS THE VISIBILITY OF LOOKING TO SIDES THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR MY HEIGHT THE WINDSCREEN BARS BLOCK INTUITIVE VIEW AND I HAVE TO BE CAREFUL
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES I HAVE TO ALMOST TURN AROUND TO SEE IF ANOTHER CAR IS NEXT TO ME
THE SIDE VISIBILITY IS KIND OF BAD DUE TO LARGE AND THICK A PILLAR I MUST PAY SO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE PEDESTRIANS ON THE SIDES WHILE I AM MAKING TURNS
I WISH HEADS UP DISPLAYS WERE STANDARD FEATURES SINCE CANNOT READ SPEEDOMETER EASILY
VERY GOOD VISIBILITY OUT OF FRONT AND SIDE WINDOWS NO PILLARS BLOCKING VIEWS MINOR PROBLEM WITH REAR VISIBILITY THOUGH
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS ON THE NEW X3 MY X3 HAD LESS BLIND SPOTS
XENON HEADLIGHTS TURN WITH STEERING EXCELLENT
REMOVE REDESIGN BLIND SPOT REAR PANEL AND OR INCLUDE BLIND SPOT DETECTION FEATURE AS STANDARD
DRIVER S OUTSIDE MIRROR REALLY NEEDS A BROADER RANGE OF ADJUSTMENT INWARD AND DOWNWARD TO MINIMIZE BLIND SPOT FOR MY SEAT POSITION AND ANGLE
I AMN VERY SHORT AND THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR AN X5 SUN VISORS I AM SHORT SO IN A DEAD ON SUN DAY THEY ARE IRRELEVENT
VISIBILITY OF BLIND SPOT SUBPAR
I THINK THE VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING FEELS VERY SAFE SO I THINK IT IS ALL GOOD CAN T SAY ANYTHING ELSE OTHERWISE
THE LIMITED VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW VIA THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS DISCONCERTING
I BELIEVE THAT ALL CARS SHOULD HAVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING
LOVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA WOULD NOT HAVE ANOTHER CAR WITHOUT ONE
REAR VIEW MIRROR VIEW DURING NIGHT DRIVING IS SOMEWHAT DISTORTED
WHEN THE SUN VISORS ARE UP ON THE SIDE WINDOWS BACK SEATS IT CREATES A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
I AM S SHORT PERSON AND IN THIS CAR I HAVE GREAT VISIBILITY ALL AROUND LOVE THAT FACT
CONSTRUCTION OF THE VEHICLE CONSTITUTES SAFETY
GOOD BACK UP CAMERA
GREAT VISIBILITY GREAT HUD GREAT BLIND SPOT DETECTION
AS A SPORT COUP THE REAR WINDOW IS ONLY SO BIG THANKFULLY THE INCORPORATED REAR CAMERA MAKES PARKING EASIER
GREAT FORWARD VISIBILITY SPORTS CAR BLIND SPOTS ON SIDES
REAR VIEW CAMERA WOULD BE BETTER THAN A MIRROR AS REAR WINDOW IS SMALL
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES BIGGER THAN MY PREVIOUS X3
STILL A BLIND SPOT FROM SIDE HEADLINER
GOOD FORWARD VISIBILITY
BLIND SIDE MONITORING IS NICE
REAR WINDOW TOO SMALL AND REAR HEAD PADS OCCLUDE VISIBILITY EVEN MORE
SLIGHT RESTRICTION IN DIRECT REAR VISION EASILY CORRECTED WITH SUITABLE ADJUSTMENT OF REAR VIEW MIRRORS SO NOT ISSUES ENCOUNTERED AN EASY VEHICLE TO POSITION AND MANEUVER
NEEDS BLIND SPOT DETECTOR
REAR WINDOW PILLARS LIMIT REAR VIEW FROM DRIVERS SEAT
BLIND SPOT AREA MINIMAL
POOR REAR VISIBILITY DUE TO SLOPING ROOFLINE
REAR WINDSHIELD ON LIFT GATE IS TOO SMALL FOR SAFE VISIBILITY
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY DURING DAY AND NIGHT DRIVING
INSTRUMENT PANEL REQUIRES MOVING THE HEAD TO SEE SOME GADGETS CAN IMPROVE BUTTONS CAN BE PLACED DIFFERENTLY ON THE MID CONSUL PANEL FOR A BETTER EASIER REACH
CONVERTIBLES CAN HAVE BIG BLIND SPOTS WITH THE TOP UP AND THE BMW DOES NOT HAVE ANY I LOVE THIS ABOUT THE CAR
BLIND SPOT MONITER SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL SLOPE ROOF MODELS
I LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERAS AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TURN ON THE FRONT SENSORS WHEN I AM HEAD IN PARKING
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY LARGE AND CAN OBSTRUCT THE DRIVER S VIEW LOVE THE VEHICLE IN BLIND SPOT INDICATOR FEATURE BUILT INTO THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
I LOVE THE WAY THE CAR HANDLES AND THE TORQUE OF THE 3 0 ENGINE THERE ARE SOME FAIRLY NASTY BLIND SPOTS BUT THE WARNING LIGHTS ON THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS HELP
REAR VISIBILITY IS RESTRICTED BY REAR WINDSHIELD BUT REAR CAMERA COMPENSATES WELL
THE RAIN SENSING AUTO ADJUSTING WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE A GREAT AND VERY PRACTICAL OPTION LIVING IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST VISIBILITY IS GOOD FOR A SPORTY SUV AND THE DRIVING POSITION IS COMFORTABLE
I CHOSE THE Q5 SPECIFICALLY FOR BETTER VISIBILITY AND SO FAR IT HAS PROVIDED THAT IN MULTIPLE WAYS
THE MIDDLE HEADREST IN THE BACK SEAT BLOCKS SOME REAR VISIBILITY
SUN VISORS TOO SMALL SIDE MIRRORS CREATE BLIND SPOTS TO THE SIDE NOT TO THE REAR FROM DRIVER VIEW POINT
SITS UP HIGHER VISIBILITY OUT OF THE SIDES IS EXCELLENT FOR AN SUV
LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA AND THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM I USE THEM ALL THE TIME
THE RADAR CRUISE CONTROL IS AN OUTSTANDING SAFETY DEVICE
LARGE BLIND SPOT BETWEEN WINDSHIELD AND PASSENGER WINDOW
SUNVISORS ARE TOO SMALL SHOULD BE LITTLE BIGGER IN WHICH LOWER PART PREVENTS SUNLOGHT BUT ALLOWS VISIBILITY ESPECISLLY DURING SUNRISE AND SUNSET
WHILE THE REAR WINDOW AT FIRST APPEARS SMALL THE ASSISTANCE OF THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THE LIGHTS WHILE CHANGING LANES MAKE UP FOR IT
I REALLY ENJOY HAVING THE WARNING LIGHTS THAT NOTIFY ME OF VEHICLES IN MY BLIND SPOT WHEN I CHANGE LANES
FOR A SHORTER PERSON THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS CREATE A BLIND SPOT WHEN YOU PULL UP TO A 4 WAY INTERSECTION CAN T SEE THE CAR STOPPED AT THE LEFT STOP SIGN DUE TO DRIVER SIDE MIRROR
THE VEHICLES LANE CHANGE SENSOR AND REAR CAMERA ARE TRULY REMARKABLE FEATURES YOU LL HAVE NO WORRIES OF CARS BEING IN YOUR BLINDSIGHT OR SOMETHING BEING IN BACK OF YOU WITH THE REAR CAMERA
BACK UP CAMERA IS POOR COMPARED TO BMW
OBSTRUCTED VISIBILITY IN SEEING CARS COMING FROM THE RIGHT DUE WIDENESS OF ROOF SUPPORT & REAR VIEW MIRROR
FEELS SAFE AND SECURE INSIDE GOOD VISIBILITY AROUND THE VEHICLE
COLLISION AVOIDANCE LANE CHANGING FEATURE
GREAT VISIBILITY FOR A VEHICLE THIS SIZE
WHAT I DON T LIKE ABOUT THE VISIBILITY IS THE SIZE LOCATION OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THEY ARE VERY LARGE AND BLOCK MY VIEW WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN
AS PREVIOUSLY STATED BLIND SPOT WARNINGS SHOULD BE IN ALL CARS
I AM FAIRLY TALL AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR MOUNTED A BIT HIGHER
SMALL REAR HATCH GLASS OPENING ALONG WITH THIRD ROW HEIGHT LIMIT REAR DORWARD VISIBILITY IT IS GOOD TO HAVE REAR CAMERA FOR USE WHEN IN REVERSE
I FEEL THAT I HAVE A BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES I HAVEN T BEEN ABLE TO ADJUST THE EXTERIOR MIRROR IN SUCH A WAY TO ELIMINATE THAT BLIND SPOT
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
REAR BACKUP CAMERA IS A VERY USEFUL SAFETY FEATURE
THE PARTITION BETWEEN RT FRONT AND BACK DOORS IS A BIT TOO WIDE HARD TO SEE BLIND SPOT
SOLID STABLE SAFE RIDE SIDE AIRBAGS
DRIVER SIDE OUT DOOR MIRROR A BLIND SPOT
THE SMALL WINDOWS IN FRONT OF THE FRONT DOORS ADD TO THE VISUAL APPEAL OF THE VEHICLE FROM THE OUTSIDE BUT DO LITTLE TO IMPROVE VISIBILITY FROM THE INSIDE OF THE OUTSIDE  THE A PILLARS ARE A LITTLE TOO THICK AND THIS AFFECTS MY VISIBILITY WHEN
THERE ARE FOUR BLIND SPOTS ON THIS VEHICLE NOT TWO
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE FRONT WINDOWS ARE DIVIDED WITH A COLUMN CREATING A BLIND SPOT
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD COLUMNS CREATE A MASSIVE BLIND SPOT
REAR VISABILITY IS LOUSY WHEN TRYIN TO BACK UP SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD HAVE THE CONCAVE ADDITION
ALL CARS HAVE THAT BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDE FORM AN APPROACHING VEHICLE
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA GET DIRTY AND GIVE A BLURRED VIEW
NEEDS BLIND SPOT SIDE MIRRORS
THE REAR SEAT PASSENGER DOOR SILLS ARE TOO HIGH THE VEHICLE IS ALREADY QUITE A TALL VEHICLE FOR SUCH A SMALL SIZE WHEN YOU MATE A TALL VEHICLE WITH REAR DOORS THAT HAVE EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH SILLS THAT MAKES FOR POOR VISIBILITY IT NEEDS TO H
OVERALL VISIBILITY AND SAFETY FEATURES ARE VERY NICE
THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL AND VISIBILITY IS LIMITED AT TIMES BECAUSE OF THE POSITIONING OF THE REAR HEAD RESTS
VISIBILITY ALL AROUND IS NOT GREAT WINDOWS SEEM TOO SMALL
REAR WIPER TOO SMALL
WOULD BE NICE IF SUN VISOR HAD A SLIDE OUT TO MAKE IT WIDER IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE AN ADJUSTABLE VISOR TO GO LOWER WHEN THE SUN IS GOING DOWN BUT THAT WOULD IMPEDE SAFETY
BACK UP CAMERA VIEW IS HELPFUL
BLIND SPOT INDICATORS HELP MAKE UP FOR POOR VISIBILITY
REAR WIPER IS WAY TO SMALL
WHEN SITTING AT AN INTERSECTION AT A UNUSUAL ANGLE WHERE YOU NEED TO SEE CARS COMING SO YOU CAN TURN OUT THE ENCORE HAS A HUGE BLIND SPOT
THE SIDE MIRRORS LIGHTING TO SHOW SOMETHING IN BLIND SPOTS IS VERY HELPFUL
HEADREST ON FRONT PASSENGER SEAT PREVENTS REAR VISION OF TRAFFIC COMING FROM THE RIGHT
BLIND SPOT MONITORING SHOULD BE STANDARD BEST SAFETY FEATURE OF ALL I WISH I HAD IT ON MY MODEL
VISIBILITY TO THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE WHILE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER BRANDS AND THE TRENDS OF RECENT YEARS IS LESS THAN I WOULD LIKE
BLIND SPOT INDICATION IS AN OPTION THAT I WISH THAT I HAD
DOOR POST AND EXTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR MAKE BLIND SPOTS
LOOKING TO THE RIGHT REAR A SLIGHT VISIBILITY PROBLEM ALSO THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE BLOCKS VISIBILITY OF CURBS ETC WHEN TURNING LEFT FROM A ONEWAY STREET OR OUT OF A NARROW DRIVEWAY
VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND I ALWAYS FEEL SAFE IN THIS CAR WITH ALL THE FEATURES TOWARD SAFETY
BACK CAMERA IS A MUST IN THE V MODEL
GIVEN THE SIDE AND REAR VISIBILITY OF THE ATS BLIND SPOT WARNING SHOULD BE STANDARD
REALLY NEED TO USE THE BACKUP CAMERA AS I CAN NOT SEE THE REAR OF THE CAR OTHERWISE WHEN BACKING UP
SHOULD HAVE A CAMERA SWITCH TO ALLOW TURNING ON CAMERAS ON DEMAND WHILE AT VERY LOW SPEEDS
THERE NEEDS TO BE A STANDARD INSTALL ON ALL VEHICLES TO HAVE BLIND SIDE SIGNALS ON MIRRORS AND FOR CHANGING LANES NOT HAVING IT CREATES RISK FOR WRECKS
THE VEHICLE THE I TEST DROVE WAS FULLY LOADED WITH OPTIONAL SAFETY DEVICES SUCH AS LANE MONITORING AND BACKUP ASSISTANCE AND BLIND SPOT DETECTION THOSE OPTIONS WERE NOT OFFERED IN A VEHICLE OF THE COLOR THAT I TRULY LIKED SO I PURCHASED THE CAR
OVER ALL I THINK VISIBILITY IS PRETTY GOOD
I LIKE THE SAFETY FEATURE BLIND SPOT WARNING THE BEST ALL CARS SHOULD COME STANDARD WITH THAT FEATURE
THE SIDE MIRRORS COULD BE A BIT BIGGER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY HOWEVER THE WARNING LIGHT IN THE MIRROR DOES ASSIST IN THAT RESPECT
MAYBE A HIGHER GRADE OF WINDSHIELD WIPER SHOULD BE USED AS STANDARD
THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS SEEMS TO INTERFERE WITH VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW
LOVE THE REAR CAMERA ALSO LIKE THE BLIND SPOT SIGNALS
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL I DON T LIKE THE SMALL SHAPE OF IT
I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE DRIVING AND USING ALL MY VISIBILITY FOR DRIVING SAFETY
FRONT VISIBILITY OBSTRUCTED BY LARGE FRONT AREA OF TRUCK
THE REAR VEDIO SCREEN ACTUALLY LIMITS REAR VISIBILITY WHE OPERATIONAL
BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING AT A BUSY PARKING LOT
THE ESCALADE DOES NOT HAVE AS GOOD VISIBILITY AS THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS THERE IS A LARGER BLIND SPOT DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE BACK OF THE CAR
AS OLDER DRIVERS WE FIND THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE TO BE AN ADDITIONAL SAFETY ASPECT WE DON T WANT TO BE WITHOUT IT WAS EASY TO ADJUST TO FOR BOTH OF US AND REALLY HELPS ON LONG DRIVES
THE VISIBILITY ALL ROUND THE VEHICLE WHEN DRIVING HAS DECREASED FROM LAST MODEL
CAMERA SYSTEM MAKES THIS VERY EASY TO PARK ETC VERY NICE FEATURE
WIFE SAYS REAR VIEW MIRROR ON PASSENGER SIDE BLOCKS HER VIEW
I TEND TO NOT USE THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE AND LANE DEPARTURE SYSTEMS AND WOULD PREFER TO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THEM
MINIMAL BLIND SPOTS GOOD VIEW ALL AROUND WHEN DRIVING AND PARKING
OPEN VIEW OF FORWARD VISIBILITY
I LOVE THE CRASH WARNING SYSTEM THE BACKUP CAMERA THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING AND THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR THESE OPTIONS TRULY MAKE ME FEEL SAFER DRIVING THIS VEHICLE
REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER TOO SMALL
VISIBILITY FROM THE FRONT WHEN LOOKING FROM AN ANGLE TO EITHER SIDE IS LIMITED WHILE AT A STOP SIGN AND LOOKING TO RIGHT OR LEFT FOR EXAMPLE
BLIND SPOT IN FRONT FROM FRAME I CAN T SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW VERY WELL AND DON T TRUST REAR VIEW CAMERA
THIS IS THE 2ND SRX I HAVE THEY BOTH HAVE A HUGE BLIND SPOT BECAUSE OF THE PILLARS IN THIS NEW CAR I HAVE THE ACCIDENT PREVENTION SENSORS WHICH ARE VERY HELPFUL
BLIND SPOT BUT WARNING LIGHTS OF VEHICLES IN ONE S BLIND SPOTS DOES HELP SOMEWHAT
BLIND SPOT WARNING SIGNAL NOT REALLY HELPFUL SMALL FLASH ON MIRROR NOT ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY DETECTABLE AND BY THE TIME YOU SEE IT THE CAR ISN T IN THE BLIND SPOT
THE HAS BETTER LANE CHANGING VISIBILITY THAN THE PREVIOUS YEARS WE HAVE DRIVEN LOVE MY WARNING OF CARS IN MY BLIND SPOT ON MY REAR VIEW MIRRORS
I HAVE ALMOST HIT PEOPLE CROSSING THE STREET 2 TIMES THE FRONT WINDSHIELD SIDE PANELS BLOCK THAT VIEW IT IS NOT A EASY VEHICLE TO SEE AROUND THE CAR THE OUTSIDE REAR CAMERA HELPS WITH THIS PROBLEM
WE FEEL EXCEPTIONAL SAFE DRIVING THE SRX HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO HUGE BLIND SPOTS LEFT AND RIGHT CAUSED BY THE PLACEMENT AND SIZE OF THE EXTERNAL REAR VIEW MIRRORS
A SMALL BLIND SPOT
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT HOWEVER WITH THE NEW INDICATORS IT IS BETTER THAN PREVIOUS MODELS
LARGE BLIND SPOTS WITH FRONT WINDSHIELD ON THE SIDES THE DESIGN OF THE A POSTS
THE VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REAR TAILGATE WINDOW IS DIFFICULT THE WINDOW IS TOO SMALL THE HEIGHT OF THE THIRD SEAT ALSO TAKES AWAY FROM THE EASE OF VISIBILITY
A NEW MODEL OF THE SRX NEEDS DESIGN IMPROVEMENT IN VISIBILITY FOR SURE WINDOWS IN A DIFFERENT ROOF LINE WOULD HELP I THINK
 IS THERE A WAY TO KEEP THE REAR CAMERA ON ALL THE TIME
SOMETIMES TO SEE BLIND SPOTS BUT THE WARNING SYSTEM HELPS SOMEWHAT
I WOULDN T PUT MY FAMILY SAFETY IN ANYTHING ELSE IN THE CASE OF A ACCIDENT I AM CONFIDENT MY FAMILY WILL BE SAFE AND UNINJURED
U NEED BACK UP CAMERA
GREAT SAFETY FEATURES
VISIBILITY IS GREAT EXCEPT WHEN THE DVD PLAYERS SCREENS ARE LOWERED SO KIDS CAN WATCH THEY BLOCK REAR WINDOW VIEW
NO REAR VISIBILITY WHEN REAR SEAT ENTERTAINMENT SCREEN IS IN THE DOWN IN USE POSITION
POOR VISABILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES
WINDOWS ARE SO DARK VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT
USE OF SIDE MIRRORS AND REAR VIEW STILL DON T SHOW CARS THAT ARE CLOSE TO ME I HAVE TO TURN MY BODY AROUND TO SEE IF THERE IS ON COMING TRAFFIC WHEN CHANGING LANES OR PULLING OUT ONTO A HIGHWAY
WHEN TURNING LEFT OR RIGHT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE CURB DUE TO WIDE WIDTH OF THE AREA BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND DRIVER PASSENGER WINDOW AND THEN ADD IN THE SIDE MIRRORS TOGETHER IT S A DEAD AREA OF NO VISIBILITY I HAVE STRUCK THE CURB W
WAS DISAPPOINTED TO DISCOVER NO FOG LIGHTS
SOMETIMES THE AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT COME ON AS SOON AS I THINK THEY SHOULD
HARD TO SEE OUT REAR VIEW WINDOW BUT WARNING SYSTEMS HELP
THIS VEHICLE HAS IMPROVED THE BLIND SPOT PROBLEM MY MKX WAS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO DETECT CARS ON THE SIDE
I DO NOT LIKE THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT THIS MAY BE BECAUSE I MOVED FROM AN STS TO AN SRX AND THE CROSSOVER NATURALLY HAS LESS VISIBILITY THAT A CAR PLATFORM
THE WINDSHIELD SIDE FRAME SOMETIMES OBSTRUCTS MY VIEW OF TRAFFIC APPROACHING FROM THE RIGHT THE HEADRESTS OBSTRUCT PART OF THE VIEW IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
NEED MORE POWERFUL HEADLIGHTS
I DRIVE MY HUSBAND S EQUINOX SOMETIMES AND I LIKE THE WIDE AREA OF VISIBILITY OF THE TRAFFIC FROM THE REAR
WHEN THE THIRD ROW SEATS ARE UP NO FOLDED DOWN THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY IS DEMINISHED
SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE A LITTLE SMALL COMPARED TO MY OLDER YUKON
POOR VISIBILITY RIGHT REAR SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES
THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE SAFEST FEELING CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN WE DO A LOT OF HIGHWAY DRIVING LONG DISTANCE AND NOT ONCE HAVE I BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT MY FAMILY S SAFETY
THE CAMERAS AND SENSORS ALL WORK WELL AND ARE GOOD SAFETY FEATURES
BACK WINDOW IS VERY SMALL WHEN LOOKING IN REAR VIEW MIRROR
HEADLAMPS APPEAR TO HAVE CLEARLY DELINEATED UPPER MARGIN WHICH ON HILLS DOES NOT ALLOW ADEQUATE FORWARD NIGHT VISIBILITY
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AND A VERY SECURE FEELING RIDE
JUST FOUND OUT MY NEW CAMARO HAS DIGITAL SPEED INDICATOR SO I GUESS THE SPEEDOMETER VIEW ISN T A HUGH ISSUE
CHANGING LANES FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IS A PROBLEM THE VISIBILITY WHEN YOU LOOK BEHIND TO THE LEFT IS ZERO THE ADDITION OF THE ROUND BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE LEFT SIDE MIRROR HELPS BUT GETS SOME GETTING USED TO
REAR QUARTER VISIBILITY OUTSIDE IS HORRENDOUS
DEFINITELY IMPROVED VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING MY SUBURBAN HAD TWO BLIND SPOTS ONE IN THE FRONT LOOKING OUT THE PASSENGER SIDE AND LOOKING BACK OUT THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE I LOVE THE FRONT WINDSHIELD
DRIVE MOSTLY WITH THE TOP DOWN SO VISIBILITY IS GOOD
REAR VISIBILITY IS TOUGH ESPECIALLY BLIND SPOTS
ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS FROM PEOPLE THAT OWN A CAMARO IS THE POOR VISIBILITY IT ISN T THE EASIEST CAR TO SEE OUT OF I KNEW THIS GOING INTO IT BUT I ALSO TRYING TO BE HONEST
BLIND SPOTS RATHER LARGE BUT EASILY OVERCOME WITH PROPER MIRROR ADJUSTMENT
THERE ARE QUITE ALOT OF BLIND SPOTS HOWEVER I WOULD NOT TRADE THE GREAT LOOK OF THE VEHICLE FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
NEEDS BLIND SPOT MONITORING OR BLIND SPOT MIRROR
FASTER SPEED OF WIPER BLADES
REAR QUARTER VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT IS LIMITED
THE VISORS ARE TOO SHORT TO BLOCK ANY SUNLIGHT ALSO THE BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES ARE REALLY BAD
ONLY COMPLAINT IS ROOF IS TO LOW MAKING SIDE FRONT REAR VISION NOT AS GOOD AS IT WOULD BE WITH COUPLE INCHES TALLER GLASS
I REALLY DON T HAVE ANY ISSUES WITH THE WINDOWS OR VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT IS VERY BAD SUN VISORS ARE TINY
REAR PASSENGER BLING SPOT COLLISION DETECTION WOULD ADD VALUE FOR THIS STY E VEHICLE MIRRORS ACCEPTABLE AND GIVE GOOD VISIBILITY ALSO IF PASSENGER IN THE BACK AND PASSENGER SEAT FORARD DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT PASSENGER DOOR
HAVE NEW X4 AND TOOK A WHILE TO GET USED TO NOT HAVING A REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER LIKE MY X3 DID FIND FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE FRUSTRATING NEED A BETTER DELAY FUNCTION SEEM TO BE ONLY 2 3 OPTIONS AND NO DELAY ALSO LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY
ALL WHEEL DRIVE WITH SNOW TIRES AND STABILITY CONTROL ON SNOW ROADS IS EXCEPTIONAL
BLIND SPOT DETECTION SHOULD BE AN AVAILABLE FEATURE ON THIS VEHICLE NOT JUST LANE DEPARTURE WARNING
GREAT FORWARD VISIBILITY AT FULL 180 DEGREES ONE MINOR ISSUE THERE IS A GLARE REFLECTION FROM THE DASHBOARD TRIM THAT APPEARS IN THE LOWER 3RD OF THE WINDSHIELD DURING STRONG DAYLIGHT SUNLIGHT
VERY LIMITED VISIBILITY WHEN ANOTHER VEHICLE GETS IN BLIND SPOT NOT GOOD FOR SAFETY BECAUSE HAVE TO PHYSICALLY TURN AROUND TO KNOW VEHICLE IS THERE ALL BMW X4 NEED LANE ASSIST FEATURE
REAR WINDOW IS SMALL AND VISIBILITY IS LIMITED
SMALL REAR WINDOW LIMITS VISIBILITY ANGLE AND SIZE ROOF SUPPORTS AT CORNERS OF WINDSHIELD LIMIT VISIBILITY OF PEDESTRIANS AND SMALL CARS
BACK UP CAMERA AND SENSOR S ARE EXCELLENT
WISH THERE WERE FEWER SIDE BLIND SPOTS
I HAD TO TURN OFF THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING I LIVE IN MICHIGAN AND AVOIDING POT HOLES MADE THE WARNING BEEP ALL THE TIME I FIGURE I LL JUST TURN IT ON DURING ROAD TRIPS OR HIGHWAY DRIVING BUT IT IS TOO DISTURBING TO HAVE IT ON JUST DRIVING ARO
REALLY WANT MORE REAR VISIBILITY
BLINDSPOT LOOKING TO RIGHT OR LEFT OUT FRONT WINDOW FROM DRIVER S SEAT DIFFICULT TO SEE CAR S ENTERING ROADWAY
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SUN VISOR EXTENSIONS FOR USE ON SIDE WINDOWS
I LIKE THE VISIBILITY AFFORDED BY SITTING HIGHER THAN OTHER VEHICLES
THE HD BACK UP CAMERA IS TERRIFIC
EXTERNAL CAMERAS FRONT REAR SIDE VIEW SHOULD BE STANDARD ON THIS VEHICLE THE FRONT REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS POOR WITHOUT THE CAMERA ASSISTANCE I WISH I WOULD HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO PURCHASE THIS FEATURE AND I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE STANDA
SIZE SHAPE OF REAR WINDOW IS PROBABLY LEAST FAVORITE FEATURE OF CAR BECAUSE OF LIMITED VISIBILITY
ALWAYS THE BLIND SPOT FROM SIDE MIRRORS PERHAPS EVERY VEHICLE SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THE SENSORS BUILT IN
CHUNKY A AND C PILLARS MAKE VISABILITY A LITTLE DIFFICULT AT TIMES
LARGER REAR VIEW MIRROWS
SERIOUS BLIND SPOTS IN REAR CORNERS BUT MIRRORS AND BLIND SPOT ASSIST HELPS
WHEN I PURCHASED MY SECOND BUICK LACROSSE I PURPOSELY PURCHASED ONE WITH THE SIDE WARNING FEATURE AND A BACKUP CAMERA BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I LOVE THE LACROSSE THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS BLINDSIDE ISSUES
FRONT WINDSHIELD PILLARS ARE VERY THICK AND DIMINISH VISIBILITY WHEN PULLING INTO A CROSS ROAD
LIKE OTHER LACROSSES THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE FRONT ROOF WINDSHIELD BEAMS ALSO DON T LIKE THE DIMMED REAR VIEW MIRROR WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK DARK I PREFER THE STYLE I HAD IN MY LACROSSE
HIGH REAR WINDOW SO I HAVE TO USE BACK UP CAMERA TO SEE CAN T SEE ANYTHING WHEN I TURN AROUND OR USE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
HARD TO SEE OUT REAR WINDOW WITHOUT USING BACKUP CAMERA
BACK UP CAMERA A GOOD ADDITION DUE TO POOR VISIBILITY OUT BACK WINDOW
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR THE BACKUP CAMERA IS A GREAT FEATURE TO SEE BEHIND
LANE CHANGE WARNING SHOULD BE MADE STANDARD
THE SIDE COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURE SHOULD BE MANDATORY FOR THIS VEHICLE
HAVE STATED ELSEWHERE BUT OUR BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS BLIND SPOTS ON CHANGING LANES
THERE ARE TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS WITHIN THE INTERIOR CAN NOT SEE CLEARLY OUT OF REA WINDOW AND WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN
OUR GREATEST DISLIKE IS THE POOR VISIBILITY FRONT AND REAR DUE TO THE STYLING I AM 6 FEET TALL AND CANNOT SEE THE HOOD PARKING IS A PROBLEM NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE HOW CLOSE TO THE CURB THE FRONT BUMPER IF IT HAD ONE IS BACKING IS A PROBLE
BLIND SPOTS LEFT RIGHT AND REAR ESPECIALLY REAR
IT S STILL NECESSARY TO PERFORM A HEAD CHECK WHEN CHANGING LANES ON THE HIGHWAY IT S NOT POSSIBLE TO STRICTLY RELY ON THE REAR SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AS THERE S A BLIND SPOT
EXECESIVE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE FRONT ROOF FRAME AND THE DOOR POSTS THEY ARE TOO WIDE AND DO CAUE A BLIND SPOT FOR THE DRIVER
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
THERE IS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVERS SEAT WHEN LOOKING LEFT TOWARD THE 1 O CLOCK DIRECTION
AS SAID BEFORE SIDE MIRRORS CREATES A BLIND SPOT
EXCELLENT VISABILITY
SIDE TO REAR BLIND SIDE IS DIFFICULT
SOMETHING ABOUT SEEING THE BACK WINDOW MOLDING IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR MAKES ME THINK THERE IS A VEHICLE THERE
LANE CHANGE ASSIST AND REAR CAMERA MAKE UP FOR ANY REARWARD VISIBILITY ISSUES
REMARKABLE VISIBILITY FOR A MODERN CAR THE REAR PARKING ASSIST CAMERA IS ALMOST SUPERFLUOUS
WITH THE TOP UP REAR VISIBILITY IS A REAL PROBLEM ONE MUST CHECK AND DOUBLE CHECK SIDE MIRRORS WHEN ENTERING TRAFFIC OR TURNING AT INTERSECTIONS A BLIND SPOT ASSIST OPTION WOULD HELP SO THAT A BLINKING LIGHT WOULD GO OFF IN THE MIRRORS IF SOMEO
PRETTY LARGE BLIND SPOTS PROBLEM LARGELY MITIGATED BY SIDE MIRRORS AND BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
IT S A CONVERTIBLE SO IT S BLIND SPOTS ARE CHALLENGING WITH THE TOP UP
INOPERABILITY OF WIPER BLADES AND FAILURE TO FIX THEM BY TWO DEALERSHIPS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE
WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION FEATURE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEARLY SEE VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT
FOR A ROADSTER THE VISIBILITY IS QUITE GOOD
I ALWAYS FEEL SAFE IN THE VEHICLE THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS WITH THE SIZE OF THE REAR VIEW WINDOW GRANTED I HAVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA INSTALLED WHICH IS MORE A WIDE ANGLE LENSE VIEW ITS STILL CHALLENGING IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE I M TAKING MORE TIM
DIFFICULT TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT AS HEAD REST BLOCKS THE VIEW
A LOT OF GREAT SAFETY FEATURES TO PREVENT AN ACCIDENT
I FEEL I AM ABLE TO DRIVE SAFELY BECAUSE I CAN SEE AROUND ME WELL AND THE WARNING SYSTEM WHILE BACKING UP IS GREAT AND THE SIGNAL ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR WARNING YOU THAT THERE IS A CAR IN YOUR BLIND SPOT IS GREAT
RIGHT AND LEFT REAR QUARTERS LIMIT VISIBILITY A LITTLE
REAR WINDOW SMALL AND HEADRESTS IN WAY BLIND SPOT OUT SIDE WINDOWS LOOKING REARWARD EVEN WITH LARGE MIRRORS
WINDSHIELD WIPERS STOP TO SOON WITH RAIN SENSING AND DOESN T CLEAR ALL DEBRI  WATER FROM THE WINDSHIELD
THE VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD EXCEPT FOR THE USUAL BLIND SPOTS
IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE A BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM TO IMPROVE SAFETY WHEN CHANGING LANES
HEADREST CAN T BE REMOVED VISIBILITY IS BAD BECAUSE OF THE HEADREST ARE IN THE VIEW
HORRIBLE BLIND SPOTS ON SIDES
THE WORST VISIBILITY IS ON THE RIGHT REAR FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU ARE PASSING AND WANT TO GET BACK IN THE RIGHT HAND LANE I HAVEN T HAD ANY NEAR MISSES OR ANYTHING BUT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT THAT IS BOTHERSOME
VISIBILITY OF CARS IN BLIND SPOT IS VERY POOR
REAR WIPERS HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO STREAK BADLY
I DON T LIKE THE HEAD REST STANDING UP SO HIGH ON THE RIGHT MID SEAT SO THAT YOU CAN T SEE OUT THE RIGHT SIDE WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE
GREAT VISIBILITY THE CAMARO AND THE DODGE COUNTERPARTS DIM SECONDS ARE VERY POOR IN VISIBILITY
HEADLIGHTS ON LOW BEAM SETTING ARE BRIGHT BUT DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE A LONG ENOUGH REACH WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE RANGE ON THE VISIBILITY
THE TECH PACKAGE COSTS TOO MUCH
HEADLIGHT & WIPER CONTROLS ARE EXACTLY OPPOSITE LOCATION FROM ACADIA VERY CONFUSING
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM SOMETIMES ACTIVATES WHEN APPROACHING AN OVERPASS
HEADS UP DISPLAY IS GREAT
SHOULD COME STANDARD WITH A REAR VIEW CAMERA OR PARK DISTANCE CONTROL FOR SAFETY WHEN BACKING UP
I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WITH THIS VEHICLE ESPECIALLY TO THE DRIVER LEFT FRONT SIDE
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT THAT THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS DO NOT CATCH BEFORE CHANGING LANES
BAD BLIND SPOT THAT EVEN LARGE VEHICLES CAN HIDE IN
DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR CAN BLOCK VIEW FOR LEFT TURN DESIGN OF REAR PASSENGER WINDOW LIMITS REAR VIEW
WHAT I DON T LIKE ABOUT MY PRIUS AND DIDN T LIKE ABOUT MY PRIUS IS THE POOR VISIBILITY AT 10 00 & 2 00 WHEN LOOKING OUT FRONT WINDSHIELD ON DRIVER S SIDE THE CAR S FRAME GETS COMPLETELY IN THE WAY OF MY ABILITY TO SEE PEDESTRIANS ON A
WHEN THE DEALER INSTALLED DVD PLAYER IS OPEN REAR VISIBILITY IS COMPROMISED
BETTER REAR VISIBILITY THAN EARLIER MODELS
I REMOVED THE REAR HEADRESTS FOR GREAT REAR VISIBILITY
WOULD LIKE THE TACOMA TO HAVE RIGHT SIDE REAR VIEW CAMERA
BLIND SPOT IS CONSIDERABLE
INCREASE THE BRIGHTNESS AND SCOPE COVERAGE OF HEADLIGHTS
THE VISIBILITY OF THIS VEHICLE ALL AROUND I FEEL IS VERY GOOD
SOLID CONSTRUCTION AIR BAGS HANDLING AND ALL WHEEL DRIVE WORK TOGETHER FOR A GREAT SAFE FEELING WHILE IN THE CAR
OTHER THAN THE POOR REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT I REALLY LOVE MY CAR I LIKE STE STYLING VERY MUCH I FEEL THAT I GOT A VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MY MONEY
THE BACKSEAT HEADRESTS COMPLETELY BLOCK MY VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW I HAD TO TAKE THOSE OUT
HEADRESTS ARE A BIT HIGH OBSTRUCTING SOME VISIBILITY
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY NICE AND PROVIDE GREAT VISIBILITY AT NIGHT
MY PRIOR AUDI HAD MANY OF THE SAME SAFETY AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURES I WAS IN A BAD ACCIDENT AND FEEL CERTAIN OF THOSE FEATURES PROTECTED ME FROM SEVERE INJURY THE CAR S ADVANCED COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS HAVE HELPED ME AVOID ACCIDENTS
NICE SAFETY SENSATION QUIET AND PEACEFUL FEELING
BLIND SPOT INDICATORS ARE NEEDED BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE OF THE CAR
IT HAS AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS THEY ARE PHENOMENAL I JUST LEAVE THEM IN AUTO ALL THE TIME AND THEY TURN ON AND OFF AND ADJUST SPEED AS NEEDED NOW I M CONSTANTLY FRUSTRATED WHEN I HAVE TO CONSTANTLY ADJUST THE INTERMITTENT SPEED OF MY
ADDITIONAL SIDE SENSORS TO COMPLEMENT EYESIGHT SYSTEM WOULD BE GREAT
SUN VISORS ARE A LITTLE SMALL MY PREVIOUS CAR HAD AN EXTENSION IN SUN VISOR YOU COULD PULL OUT WHEN SUN WAS REALLY STRONG VERY HELPFUL FEATURE HEADLIGHTS ALONE ARE JUST OKAY WE ADDED FOG LIGHTS WHICH GIVE MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY FEW BLIND SPO
BLIND SPOT RIGHT REAR NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED
SUN VISORS NEED STD LED LIGHTS NEED STD VOICE COMMANDS PORSCHE RIPS YOU OFF WITH TOO MANY COSTLY OPTIONS THAT ARE STANDARD ON 15 000 CARS
FRONT AND REAR PARKING SENSORS ARE OUTSTANDING
MIRRORS ARE NOT EFFECTIVE ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH TARGA ROOF ROLL HOOP REAR BLIND SPOTS
CAMERA IS ONLY ON WHEN THE RADIO IS ON IT WOLD BE NICE IF THE CAMERA WENT ON WHEN YOU ARE BACKING UP WHETHER OR NOT THE RADIO IS ON
THE MID ENGINE MAKES REAR VISION DIFFICULT USE THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS AND CAMERA A LOT IT IS WORTH THE INCONVENIENCE FOR THE GREAT HANDLING AND STEERING
AS EXPECTED THE REAR VISIBILITY IS SUB PAR THIS IS WHY I ORDERED A BACK UP CAMERA IT WOULD BE GREAT IF PORSCHE WERE TO INCLUDE THE BACK UP CAMERA AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT SINCE THE REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR
VEHICLE EQUIPED WITH BI XENON HEADLIGHTS I REALLY LIKE THE DYNAMIC LIGHTING SYSTEM WHICH ROTATES WHEN TURNING CORNERS
THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS DO NOT AFFORD ENOUGH BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY I HAVE TO MOVE MY HEAD TO CHECK MY LEFT REAR CORNER A STICK ON MIRROR HELPS BUT IS NOT THE IDEAL SOLUTION I VE HAD SOME CLOSE CALLS
HAVE A STANDARD BACK UP CAMERA OR OFFER AS AS STAND ALONE OPTION WITHOUT PARKING SENSORS
THE REFLECTION OF THE DASH INTO THE WINDSHIELD IS A SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEM I WOULD NOT BUY THIS CAR WITH A BEIGE DASH AGAIN GIVEN THE CHOICE
HAS SOME BLIND SPOTS LOOKING OUT SIDE BACK
HAS VERY GOOD VISIBILITY
REAR VISIBILITY AT NIGHT COULD USE SOME HELP
BEING A 2 SEATER MID ENGINE COUPE WITH ONLY FRONT SIDE WINDOWS BLIND SPOTS ARE NOT AS CLEAR COMPARED TO A 4 SEATER WITH BACK SIDE WINDOWS I WOULD NOT CONSIDER THIS TO BE A CAR FLAW SINCE ITS DESIGN DICTATES THAT BUT THEY CAN EASILY COMPENSATE B
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OUT THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW SUE TO THE TARGA TOP YOU JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER TO USE SIDE AMD REAR MIRRORS ALONG WITH ACTUALLY LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW
NO BACKUP CAMERA AS STANDARD HAMPERS REAR VISIBILITY
SIGHT LINES ARE SOMEWHAT BLOCKED WHEN LOOKING TO THE REAR OUTSIDE ON PASSENGER SIDE FROM DRIVER S SEAT NECESSITATING TOO MUCH RELIANCE SOLELY ON REAR VIEW MIRRORS
BACKUP LIGHTING COULD BE BRIGHTER FOR REARVIEW CAMERA TO BE A BIT BETTER PICTURE AT NIGHT
REAR VISIBILITY IS BELOW AVERAGE BACK UP CAM SHOULD BE STANDARD
THE ONLY REASON I GAVE 5 FOR FEELING OF SAFETY WHEN DRIVING IS THE BLIND SPOT
REAR VISIBILITY CAN BE IMPROVED I WILL GIVE IT A 8 10
THE VEHICLE TRULY NEEDS BLIND SPOT MONTORING
HAS SOME BLIND SPOTS THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE NOT WELL LIT FOR NIGHTIME DRIVING
DRIVERS SIDE REAR BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
SMALL FIEND OF VIEW TO READ OF VEHICLE LARGE BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDES
REAR AND REAR SIDE VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT WITH THE TOP UP
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL
THINK THAT MY MOST RECENT MODEL HAD BETTER CHANGING LANE VISIBILITY THAN PREVIOUS BUT IM STILL VERY CAUTIOUS
THE HEADLIGHT SYSTEM IS UTTERLY PHENOMENAL
LOVE THE BLIND VIEW WARNING LIGHTS
SOMETIMES VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE BLIND SPOT REAR CORNERS
WOULD HAVE LIKE REAR CAMERA OPTION AT POINT OF SALE
HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW A CAR THIS EXPENSIVE SHOULD COME STANDARD WITH A BACKUP CAMERA SINCE MOST CHEAPER NEW CARS TRUCKS DO
REAR WINDOW HAS LIMITED VISABILITY
IT S FINE WITH THE TOP DOWN BUT OTHERWISE POOR REAR VISIBILITY FROM SIDES AND REVIEW MIRROR
LANE CHANGE ASSIST AND BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHTS
REAR VISIBILITY IS BAD
BLIND SPOTS ARE A PROBLEM
VISIBILITY IS IMPAIRED WHEN TOP IS UP THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO CLEAR LANE CHANGES OR WHEN BACKING UP MIRRORS HELP BUT I AM NEVER SECURE UNTIL I CHECK SEVERAL TIMES TO BE SURE I AM NOT CHANGING LANES IN FRONT OF A CAR THAT I AM LI
IT S A CONVERTIBLE SO SOME VISIBILITY IS REDUCED
SIDE AND REAR VISIBILITY IS TERRIBLE
THE VISIBILITY IN MY ACURA ILX IS GREAT
I REALLY LOVE THE HEADLIGHTS SO MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY IN THE NIGHT I HAVE A BETTER VIEW IN FRONT OF ME AND ON EACH SIDE OF THE ROAD PASSENGERS OFTEN COMMENT ON WHAT GREAT HEADLIGHTS I HAVE
I REALLY DISLIKE YOUR VOICE RECOGNITION SYSTEM THE ELECTRONICS INTERFACE IS VERY FRUSTRATING I REALLY FEEL DUPED AND ABUSED
HEAD LIGHTS WHEN DRIVING ON HILLY ROADS YOU LOSE VISIBILITY DUE TO HEADLIGHTS HAVE A TOP LINE TO THEM THAT DOES NOT LIGHT THE ROAD AS DOES NORMAL OR OLD TYPE LIGHT
DRIVER SIDE MIRROR HAS SOME KIND OF DUAL VISIBILITY WITH IS DISTORTING AND NOT HELPFUL AT ALL AND MIRROR IS QUITE LARGE FOR SEEING AROUND WHEN MAKING LEFT TURNS
BLINKER LIGHTS ON REVIEW MIRRORS WOULD BE NICE AND ADD SAFETY
LOVE ALL THE SAFETY FEATURES CAMERA LANE DEPARTURE BLIND SPOT ETC
I LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA I HAVE FOUND THE UNIQUE DIRVERSIDE MIRROR HAS SAVED MY BACON MORE THAN ONCE
HID LIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL
THE PANORAMIC SLICE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR IS DISCONCERTING TO ME WHEN I LOOK INTO IT PRIOR TO CHANGING LANES
ABILITY TO SEE BLIND SPOT OUT OF THE DRIVER S SIDE IS VERY DIFFICULT
REAR WINDOW SEEMS TO ACCUMULATE A LOT OF ROAD DIRT IN BAD WEATHER THE REAR WIPER AND SPRAY ARE OK JUST NOT OUTSTANDING
I ALWAYS WANT TO SEE MORE WHEN I CHECK THE REAR VIEW USING THE REAR VIEW CAMERA I DO FIND THE SHADING ON THE SCREEN THAT IS SUPPOSED TO SHOW SAFETY ZONES ACTUALLY DECREASES MY ABILITY TO SEE THE AREA I PREFERRED THE VIEW FROM MY INFINITI
SAFETY FEATURES ARE TOP NOTCH IT WAS A BIG SELLING POINT FOR THE VEHICLE ESPECIALLY THE NEWER SYSTEMS INCLUDING CMBS AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL VISIBILITY IS EVEN EXCEPTIONAL WITH THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM PULLED DOWN
GREAT VISIBILITY ALL AROUND IN FACT THE CAR FEELS AND DRIVES SMALLER THAN IT IS BUT WITH A GREAT COMMANDING VIEW OF THE ROAD
I DON T QUITE GET THE VALUE OF THE BLIND SPOT SECTION ON THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR
HEADLIGHTS AND OVERALL VISIBILITY ARE OUTSTANDING
REAR VIEW CAMERA FOGS UP AND GETS WET IN RAINY CONDITIONS
THIRD ROW HEADRESTS IMPAIR VISIBILITY
THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR PASSENGER DOORS ON THE DRIVER S SIDE
THE RDX SHOULD COME WITH SIDE CAMERAS WHEN CHANGING LANES JUST LIKE THE HONDA CRV CONSIDERING THAT ACCURA IS HONDA S LUXURY BRAND THIS IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING THE REAR CAMERA COULD HAVE A BETTER QUALITY AS WELL
GREAT HEADLIGHTS & REAR VISIBILITY
COULD USE WIDER SUN VISORS ON LATERAL ASPECT
NO REAL BLIND SPOTS
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR SUN VISORS COULD BE A LITTLE WIDER OR INCLUDE EXTENSIONS
WOULD LIKE CROSS TRAFFIC MONITOR AND CLOSING SPEED MONITOR ALSO RESPONSE FROM ADAPTIVE CRUSE CONTROL COULD BE SMOTHER
BLIND SPOT WARNING HELPS WITH LANE CHANGING AND REAR CAMERA HELPS BACKING UP VISBILITY TO SIDES AND BACK IS NOT AN ISSUE AS A RESULT
I WISH IT HAD A THIN STRIPE OF WINDOW TINT AT THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD LIKE MOST CARS
BLIND SPOT CAMERA WHILE CHANGING LANE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING COLLISION SAFETY
WE ESPECIALLY LIKE THE SIDE COLLISION AVOIDANCE INDICATORS BLIND SPOTS WAS A CONCERN WHEN WE PURCHASED OUR ACURA TLX SINCE WE FELT OUR TL HAD A FEW
DIRECT REAR VISIBILITY THROUGH BACK WINDOW IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED BUT THE VISIBILITY VIA THE BACKUP CAMERA IS EXCELLENT
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ICE UP EASILY
I HAD TO CHANGE MY WHOLE WAY OF BACKING THE MIRRORS MOVE DOWN WHEN BACKING AND USING THE REAR VIEW CAMERA HAS BEEN AN ADJUSTMENT NOTHING BAD JUST DIFFERENT
THE LED HEADLIGHTS WORK GREAT IN BAD WEATHER LIKE RAIN I FEEL THEY ARE BRIGHTER THAN THE XENON HEADLIGHTS IN MY PREVIOUS CAR
I AM 6 AND MY WIFE IS 4 9 1 2 SO WE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS VISIBILITY WISE
SOMETIMES HARD TO SEE REAR VISIBILITY DURING SUNSET
BLIND SPOT MONITORS ON THE REAR VIEW SIDE MIRRORS WOULD BE HELPFUL
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER SPRAY DOESN T SEEM TO WORK WELL
WINDSHIELD WIPERS TEND TO BE GRABBY SQUEAKY
BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO SWITCH LANES
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A LITTLE SMALL
I WISH THE MODEL WE BOUGHT HAD A BLIND SPOT WARNING BC IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE BACK RIGHT LANE FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT WHEN THE CONVERTIBLE ROOF IS NOT OPENED
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CONVINCED ME TO BUY THIS CAR IS BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY FEATURES
BAD BLIND SPOTS IN REAR
THERE IS A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
REAR VIEW POOR WHEN HEAD IMPACT CUSHIONS IN WHICH I TOOK OFF NEEDS BETTER SIDE MIRRORS OR LANE CHANGE AVOIDANCE SIGNALS NOT SAFE AS IT IS
REAR VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS VERY POOR
THE SIZE OF THE POSTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD HAS CAUSED A SCARE TWICE WHERE SOMEONE WAS IN MY BLIND SPOT AND COMPLETELY HIDDEN WHEN I LOOKED AT A STOP ONLY TO SEE THEM AS I PULLED FORWARD
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHTS BUT AM GETTING USED TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE INDEED SUCH EVIDENT BLIND SPOTS
VISIBILITY WHEN REVERSING IS POOR BUT HASN T CAUSED ANY PROBLEMS YET
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS SMALL JUST ENOUGH FOR THE SMALL REAR WINDOW I HAVE TO USE MY SIDE MIRRORS TO SEE MORE OF MY BLIND SPOTS
I AM NOT SURE IF I HAVE LANE DEPARTURE BUT IF I DO I AM NOT SURE HOW IT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK
BECAUSE IT IS A CONVERTIBLE THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALLER AND IT S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS USE OF THE CAMERA IS A MUST
MINIMAL BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY WHEN OVERTAKING IS A BIT OF A PROBLEM
WINDSHIELD WIPERS COME TO A HALT WHILE STOPPING FOR TRAFFIC SIGNALS WHY
I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS WHEN DRIVING
VISIBILITY WITHOUT THE ELECTRONIC SIDE ASSIST WOULD BE A CHALLENGE WHEN CHANGING LANES ON MULTIPLE LANE ROADS
AUDI GIVES A COMPLETE SENSE OF SAFETY AND SECURITY
PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR VISIBILITY COULD BE BETTER
BLIND SPOT SYSTEM IS VERY USEFUL IN THIS CAR
REAR VIEW MIRROR AND SIDE MIRRORS ARE A BIT SMALL
MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
I HAVE A CONVERTIBLE SO YOU EXPECT SOME REAR VISIBILITY ISSUES HOWEVER THE BACK UP CAMERA HAS HELPED ALLOT
I HAVE THE CABRIOLET SO REAR VISIBILITY WITH THE TOP UP IS TYPICAL OF CONVERTIBLES THE REAR VIEW CAMERA HELPS
VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD EXCEPT FOR THE BLIND SPOTS DUE TO THE CONVERTIBLE TOP I DON T FIND THIS TO BE A BIG PROBLEM WITH THE USE OF SIDE MIRRORS AND THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
WHEN BACKING UP IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY ON THE REVERSE CAMERA WHICH I AM NOT VERY COMFORTABLE WITH
FEEL THERE IS A BLIND SIDE ON DRIVER SIDE
THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVER SIDE THE PART OF THE CAR THAT THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR ATTACHES TO IS IN THE WAY I M NOT SURE IF IT IS TOO WIDE OR JUST AT AN ODD ANGLE BUT I HAVE TO LOOK AROUND IT AND I HAVE HAD TIMES WHERE I COULDN T S
EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A BACK UP CAMARA IT S HARD TOO SEE OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER WHEN REVERSING
I REALLY LIKE THAT FOG LIGHTS WERE ADDED TO THE CAR I LIKE THE FACT THAT I CAN BE SEEN EASLIY FROM THE FRONT OR THE REAR BECAUSE OF THE TYPE AND STYLE OF THE LIGHTS I HAVE ENJOYED TURNING OFF THE CAR AND NOT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT TURNING OFF T
OUT OF ALL THE FULL SIZE SUVS I TESTED IT HAD THE BEST VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOTS AND GLARE IN SIDE MIRRORS FROM CHROME AROUND AIR VENTS INSIDE OF VEHICLE
I FEEL VERY SAFE WHILE DRIVING MY SORENTO I LOVE HOW I HAVE GREAT VISIBILITY OF ALL DIRECTIONS WHILE DRIVING
NO ALARM ON BACKUP CAMERA
I LOVE THE LANE WATCH SIDE CAMERA WOULD LIKE TO SEE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE CAR
PASSENGER HEADRESTS OBSTRUCT REAR VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT ALERT SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT
SINCE IT HAS A BACKUP CAMERA I DON T HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE VISIBILITY
REAR VIEW CAMERA AND SIDE MONITORING DEVICES MAKE UP FOR LIMITED VISIBILITY
I M A SHORT PERSON THE VISOR IS OF NO USE SO WHEN DRIVING INTO THE SUN I HAVE DIFFICULTIES SEEING THE SEATS DO NOT ADJUST UP OR DOWN SO REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE ALMOST USELESS
EXCELLENT AUTOMATED WARNING SYSTEMS
ITS UNDERSTOOD THAT A 4 DOOR COUPE WILL HAVE SOMEWHAT LIMITED REAR VISIBILTY DUE TO THE ROOF LINE
BLIND SPOT ASSIST IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE A AND B PILLARS COULD BE NARROWER FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
I LOVE THE FRONT COLLISION FEATURE AND GLAD IT S STANDARD IT S VERY ACCURATE AND USEFUL
FOR THE PRICE OF THIS VEHICLE IT SHOULD HAVE A REAR CAMERA
SINCE THE CAR HAS VERY BAD BLIND SPOTS THE BLIND SPOT AND CHANGE LANE FEATURE SHOULD BE AVAILABLE ON THIS CAR BUT IT IS NOT
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT COVER THE PASSENGER SIDE VERY WELL THE HEADRESTS FOR THE 2ND ROW SOMEWHAT BLOCK THE REAR VISIBILITY
THE BLIS IS GREAT AND IN LANE CONTROL
I WISH I HAD THE COLLISION WARNING AND LANE DEPARTURE DRIVING SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY DID NOT KNOW THAT IT WAS AVAILABLE
VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD SEAT POSITIONING ALLOWS ME TO BE AWARE OF THE ENTIRE VEHICLE SAFETY EQUIPMENT PERFORMS AS IT SHOULD IT IS A PLEASURE TO DRIVE I REALLY LIKE THE ENTIRE PACKAGE
THE VEHICLE IS VERY WIDE AND LOWER THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR AND IT TAKE SOME GETTING USED IT THE CHANGING LANE BLIND SPOT LIGHTS ARE HARD TO GET USED TO BUT IAM GETTING THERE IT S NOW NICE TO HAVE ANOTHER SAFETY CHECK BEFORE CHANGING LANES AS THER
TOUGH TO JUST FORWARD PARKING WITHOUT FRONT CAMERA ACTIVE REAR CAMERA VISIBILITY IS UNUSABLE AT NIGHT REVERSE LIGHTS AREN T BRIGHT ENOUGH TO ILLUMINATE THE REAR CAMERA VIEW
I HAVE THE SIDE ASSIST FEATURE WHICH HELPS WITH KNOWING WHEN CARS ARE PASSING ME ON THE LEFT I REALLY LIKE THIS SAFETY FEATURE
THE CAR HAS A HORRIBLE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES AND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL
WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE LEFT I FEEL THAT I CAN T SEE THE FULL LENGTH OF THE LANE THERE IS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT AND IT IS A BIT SCARY
VERY GOOD VISIBILITY MINIMAL BLIND SPOTS
VISIBILITY OUT OF BACK SIDE WINDOWS IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT BUT I AM FINDING THAT THE BACKUP CAMERA REALLY HELPS JUST NEED TO GET USE TO USING IT
THE MIDDLE HEAD REST IN THE SECOND ROW SHOULD BE REMOVABLE SO THAT YOU HAVE A BETTER VIEW WITH REAR VIEW MIRROR
VISIBILITY OVER THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE IS NICE AND CLEAR
EASIER TO SEE BLIND SPOTS BECAUSE OF THE WINDOWS ADJACENT TO THIRD ROW FRONT PILLARS A BIT TOO THICK FOR MY LICKING WHEN VIEWING SIDE TRAFFIC OUT THE FRONT WINDOW
THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS SOMETIMES ALERT ME WHEN THERE ISN T A VEHICLE PRESENT
THE DRIVER SIDE POST CAUSES BLIND SPOT DIFFICULTIES I HAVE TO TURN MY HEAD AND QUICKLY FOCUS TO ENSURE THAT THE SPACE IS CLEAR
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER FOR BETTER VISABILITY
I HAVE TO ADMIT I FEEL LIKE I HAVE LESS SIDE VISIBILITY I JUST CAN T SEEM TO GET THE SIDE MIRRORS POSITIONED TO GIVE ME GOOD VIEW TO MY BLIND SPOTS ON EITHER SIDE
A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE INTO BLIND SPOT AREAS MONITORING SYSTEM IS VERY USEFUL AND RECOMMENDED TO BE STANDARD
REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE EXCEPTIONAL
THIS CAR IS THE GREATEST EVER I LOVE IT WISH I WOULD HAVE GOT THE BACK UP CAMERA OPTION THOUGH
THE REAR CAMERA GREATLY HELPS WHEN BACKING UP WITHOUT IT I WOULD HAVE TROUBLE SEEING DIRECTLY BEHIND ME I M NOT REFERRING TO SIDE REAR I CAN SEE VERY WELL THERE
THE VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY OF THE Q3 IS EXCEPTION WITH A HIGHER RIDING POSITION AND LARGE ENOUGH WINDOWS THROUGHOUT THE VEHICLE VISIBILITY IS GREAT WITH THE SIDE ASSIST AND REAR VIEW CAMERA WITH BACKUP AND PARKING SENSORS IS EXCEPTIONAL
HEAVY REFLECTION OF DASHBOARD IN WINDSHIELD CAUSES DISTRACTIONS & DIFFICULTY SEEING TINT ON SIDE & BACK MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE AT NIGHT DIFFICULT TO SEE CLEARLY IN ALL MIRRORS AT NIGHT LACK OF HEAD ROOM IN FRONT CABIN CAUSES DIFFICULTY GETTI
THE SUN VISORS NEED EXTENDERS TO THE CENTER AND THE OUTER EDGES THEY DO NOT PROVIDE NEARLY ENOUGH COVERAGE AGAINST THE RISING   SETTING SUN
I REALLY LIKE THE AUTO DIMMING MIRRORS IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK IT SHOULD BE STANDARD TO HAVE A BACK UP CAMERA
IT S A BIT HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES I HAVE THE CONVERTIBLE HAVING BLIND SPOT MONITORING ON THE MIRRORS WOULD BE A PLUS
I HAVE EXPERIENCED GOOD VISIBILITY ALL THE WAY AROUND
IT FEELS LIKE A VERY WELL BUILT STURDY VEHICLE THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT AND ADDING TO THAT IS THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THE FRONT AND BACK UP SENSORS
LARGE BLIND SPOT NOTED WHILE DRIVING ON INTERSTATE
DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES OUT SIDE WINDOWS IN BLIND SPOTS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS COMING UP FROM THE SIDE VISIBILITY THROUGH THE BACK WINDOWS CAN GET DIFFICULT
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
THERE IS A SMALL SHORT TERM BLIND SPOT AS OTHER CARS COME UP FROM BEHIND TO PASS JUST BEHIND THE C PILLAR TRANSITIONING TO THE B PILLAR SEEMS LIKE THE SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR COULD BE MADE A LITTLE LARGER TO PROVIDE A LARGER FIELD OF VIEW
CAR DID NOT COME WITH TINTED WINDOWS TOO MUCH GLARE
THE CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE VISIBILITY IS PROBLEMATIC
I WISH MY CAR CAME WITH BLIND SPOT MONITORS
THIS CAR OFFERS WHAT MY LAST CAR DIDN T GREAT VISIBILITY FROM THE ALL AREAS
REAR VISIBILITY IS LIMITED
MINIMAL BLIND SPOTS LED HEADLIGHTS ARE EXCELLENT AND SHOULD BE STANDARD ON VEHICLES OF THIS LEVEL
REAR VIEW CAMERA IS A NECDESITY
REAR WIPER DOESN T CLEAR ENOUGH AND WINDOW IS SMALL TO BEGIN WITH
HEADLIGHT WASHERS ARE A REAL PLUS
LANE CHANGING BLIND SPOT WARNING ETC SHOULD BE STANDARD AND IN THE BASE MODEL REAL VIEW CAMERA SHOULD ALSO BE STANDARD
BLIND SPOT LEFT REAR
SIDE MIRROR VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED FOR BLIND SPOTS
SOME BLIND SPOTS IN DRIVERS SEAT
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE FOR BLIND SPOT WARNING OR LANE DEPARTURE WARNING OR COLLISION WARNING TO BE AVAILABLE
REAR BLIND SPOT DIFFICULT TO MANAGE BLIND SPOT WARNING NOT ADEQUATE IT SEEMS THAT THE CAMERAS ARE NOT PICKING UP VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT
HARD TO SEE BLIND SPOTS
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR FOR CLOSE VEHICLES AT NIGHT POOR SIDE BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY
HUD IS A GREAT PRODUCT AND LED HEADLIGHTS PROVIDE AMAZING NIGHT VISIBILITY ON COUNTRY ROADS
SIDE VISIBILITY IS NOT OUTSTANDING
REAR CAMERA TENDS TO COLLECT SALT AND OTHER STUFF FROM THE ROAD OBSCURING VISION
I HAVE AVOIDED COLLISION TWICE DUE TO THE HUGE BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT DUE TO THE DOOR BEAM LANE TRACK AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE SHD BE STANDARD OR CUSTOMERS DID HAVE OPTION TO ADD LATER AS OF NOW I WILL GAVE TO LIVE WITHOUT IT TILL I HAVE THIS CAR
SIGNIFICANT DRIVERS SIDE BLIND SPOT NEED A CONVEX MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
GOOD FRONT SIDE VISIBILITY BUT REAR SIDE VIEW IS LESS ASPECTS LIKE LANE CHANGE ASSISTANCE AND COLLISION WARNING COULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED
I HAVE DRIVEN MANY VEHICLES I FIND IT A BIT HARDER THAN USUAL TO GAUGE THE X3 S POSITION IN THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR IN RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER CARS ON THE ROAD
I CAN SEE FROM ANY ANGLE IN THIS CAR NO BLIND SPOTS FOR ME I LIKE THAT
VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT
LENGTH AND DESIGN OF SUN VISOR TOO LITTLE NO REAR OR SIDE AIR BAGS
BLIND SPOT DETECTOR SHOULD COME AS A STANDARD FEATURE THIS IS AND THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE ANYMORE MANY OTHER CARS ALREADY HAVE IT SAME FOR XENON OR LED HEADLIGHTS IT S ALMOST AN EMBARRASSMENT TO DRIVE A BMW WITH YELLOW HEADLIG
REAR VIEW CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD FEATURE
WHEN CHANGING LANES THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN MERGING LEFT
THE CAR SHOULD COME WITH A REAR VIEW CAMERA AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IS FANTASTIC
BLIND SPOT INDICATORS SHOULD BE BRIGHTER
THE BLIND SPOT IS A BIT ANNOYING AND RATHER LARGE
EVEN THOUGH MY CAR HAS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING I STILL RELY ON THE MIRRORS A SMALL CONVEX MIRROR ON THE MAIN OUTSIDE LEFT MIRROR WOULD HELP
THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES AND THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR IS NOT VERY BRIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR FLASH ON THE HEADS UP DISPLAY OR MAKE A SOUND
VISORS ARE KIND OF SHORT AND DON T GIVE COVERAGE WHEN SUN IS BEHIND GAP BY THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE NEW X5 INSTALLED A SMALLER SIDE WINDOW HARD TO SEE OUTSIDE BACK I LIKED THE BIGGER SIDE WINDOW IN MY LAST X5 WHOSE VISIBILITY WAS GOOD PLEASE MAKE A BIG SIDE WINDOW X5 IS BIG ENOUGH TO HAVE A BIGGER WINDOW
THIS VEHICLE FEELS EXCEPTIONALLY SAFE BEST IN ITS CLASS I WOULD APPRECIATE IF THE DRIVER S SEAT COULD BE ADJUSTED TO A HIGHER POSITION AS I AM OF SHORT STATURE BUT THE THE OVERALL VISIBILITY IS STILL OUTSTANDING ADJUSTABLE FOOT PEDALS WOULD AL
THE BLIND SPOT IS BIGGER THAN I EXPECTED IT TO BE AND REAR VIEW A LITTLE CONSTRAINED
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER SETTING IS TOO FAST AND HAVE TO MANUALLY START AND STOP
POOR VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING OUT THE REAR WINDOW IT S VERY SMALL MUST RELY ON LOOKING & BACK UP CAMERA
I LIKE HOW THE DOORS AUTOMATICALLY LOCK WHEN I AM INSIDE THE CAR I ALSO REALLY LIKE HOW THE HEADLIGHT AND BLINKER CAN BE ON SIMULTANEOUSLY THAT IS ONE REASON WHY I PICKED MY BMW OVER AUDI
SUN VISORS DO NOT HAVE AN EXTENSION TO BLOCK OUT SUN BETWEEN VISOR AND REAR VIEW MIRROR
I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE IN THIS CAR IT HUGS THE ROAD CORNERS WELL AND HAS LOTS OF GREAT SAFETY FEATURES IT IS A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OUT THE REAR SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES BUT HAS GOOD VISIBILITY FOR A COUPE IT IS HEAVY AND STURDY BUT STILL AGILE
THE BIGGEST SAFETY CONCERN I HAVE IS OTHER DRIVERS SEEING ME WHEN THEY CHANGE LANES
ALL LUXURY CARS SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH FRONT AND REAR CAMERAS AS A STANDARD
COULD NOT BELIEVE THERE WAS NOT A BACK UP CAMERA INCLUDED EVEN IN BASE MODEL WE PURCHASED I WAS SO FRUSTRATED TO LEARN THIS JUST AFTER WE PURCHASED AS I EXPECTED IT TO HAVE ONE FOR THE PRICE IT IS EMBARRASSING THAT THIS IS NOT STANDARD OUR
BLINDSPOTS ARE A PROBLEM HAVE COME TO DEPEND ON BLINDSPOT MONITOR WHICH IS ALSO NOT VERY EASY TO SEE SIDE MIRRORS ARE WAY TO SMALL AND DO NOT GIVE MUCH OF A VIEW
WHILE I AM GLAD THAT BMW NARROWED THE WIDTH OF THE X5 FROM THE MODEL IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THE NEW MODEL ACTUALLY FITS BUT JUST BARELY WIDTH WISE IN OUR GARAGE I DON T LIKE THE NARROW NESS FROM A ROLLOVER SAFETY STANDPOINT THE NAR
NOT REALLY ANY BLIND SPOTS SIDE AND REAR MIRRORS ARE GOOD SIZED AND WELL POSITONED VERY EASY CAR TO DRIVE
AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NOT A FAN OF THE AUTO WIPERS THE AUTO WIPERS ON MY OLD SAAB 9 3 WERE VASTLY SUPERIOR SEE THAT CAR AND COPY THAT MUCH EASIER TO USE AND WAY MORE ACCURATE EVERYTHING ELSE IN TERMS OF VISIBILITY IS FINE
SUN VISORS AND SIDE REAR MIRRORS TOO SMALL WINDSHIELD WIPER SPEEDS NEED MORE SLOWER OPTIONS I FEEL LIKE THEY ARE EITHER OFF OR ON
CAR HAS EXCELLENT VISIBILITY HOWEVER I THINK THAT A BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM SHOULD BE STANDARD AT THIS PRICE POINT
I WISH THAT THE M235I HAD FOG LIGHTS AND HAD AN OPTION FOR HEADS UP DISPLAY
WISH SOME OF THE SAFETY DEVICES SUCH AS LANE CHANGE WARNINGS AND OTHER ELECTRONIC NOTIFICATIONS WERE ON THE VEHICLE MY ERROR THE VEHICLE DOES HAVE BLIND SPOTS WITH LANE CHANGING
SINCE I AM SHORT THE BAR IN FRONT THAT GOES FROM THE CEILING TO THE DOOR WITH THE RIGHT REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS LARGE AND BLOCKS MY VIEW AT INTERSECTIONS
THE HIGH SEATING POSITION GREATLY IMPROVES VISIBILITY
OVERALL VERY GOOD AND IF YOU USE MIRROWS CORECTLY THE RIGHT REAR BLIND SPOT IS NOT MUCH OF AN ISSUE LOVE BACKUP CAMERA AND FOWARD READ SONAR HAD NO IDEA HOW USEFUL IT WAS WHEN I BOUGHT THE CAR
STEERING WHEEL BLOCKS VISIBILITY OF INSTRUMENTS
OVERALL EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY & HANDLING
FRONT WASHERS TEND TO SPRAY TOO LOW WITH A SMALL STREAM AND TOO VIGOROUSLY TO CLEAR THE EDGES OF THE WIPER AREAS AT SLOWER SPEEDS
PILLAR POST OVER DRIVERS LEFT SHOULDER IS A BLIND SPOT THE PASSANGER HEAD REST ALSO BLOCKS THE DRIVERS VIEW ON ANGLED CORNER ENTRANCE TO SOME ROADS
THE ONLY OCCASIONAL DIFFICULTY IS LOOKING OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER FROM THE DRIVER SEAT VISIBILITY ISN T QUITE AS GOOD AS IT IS LOOKING BACK OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER DUE TO THE HEADREST BUT THE SIDE MIRRORS ESP THE BLIND SPOT WARNING ARE SUPERB AN
OF THE SEVERAL CARS I CONSIDERED AUDI HAD THE BEST OUTSIDE VISIBILITY AND IT WAS A PRIME FACTOR IN MY CHOICE
BEST PERFORMANCE ON ICE OF ANY VEHICLE I VE EVER DRIVEN BEST VISIBILITY OUT THE FRONT WINDOW BEST WINDSHIELD WIPER CLEARANCE
BLIND SPOT INDICATORS ARE BENEFICIAL
EVERYTHING IS PRETTY STRONG EXCEPT FOR THE BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR AND IN THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE THE STRUCTURAL POSTS ARE LARGE ESPECIALLY IN THE FRONT AND IT IS NOT EASY TO SEE WITH THEM IN THE WAY
THE REAR FACING CAMERA IS TOO DIM AND UNCLEAR
I LOVE THE HEADS UP DISPLAY OF THE SPEED
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS BECAUSE OF HEAVILY SLOPED STYLING
THE CAR GIVES ME A HIGH CONFIDENCE IN MY ABILITY TO AVOID A COLLISION AND SHOULD A COLLISION THE CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER SAFETY FEATURES SEEM TO PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL PROTECTION
VISBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES SIS NOT SO GREAT SOMETIMES
THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT AND CATCH MY ATTENTION WITHOUT ME HAVING TO LOOK AT THE MIRROR FOR A SMALL WARNING I AM COMPARING THIS TO THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM ON MY JEEP OVERLAND
ADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES SHOULD BE STANDARD AT AN 80K PRICE POINT
THE TURN SIGNAL LIGHTING IN THE EXTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRRORS IS SO BRIGHT THAT IT IS VERY DISTRACTING
VISIBILITY BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE COULD USE REAR WIPER
EXCELLENT BACKUP CAMERA
SINCE IT IS SPORTY MADE THE REAR VISIBILITY IS QUIET LESS FROM THE ANGLED REAR SCREEN WHICH MAKES SOMETIME LITTLE SCARY CHANGING LANES ON FAST HIGHWAYS
MY LAST CAR HAD SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS IT IS FANTASTIC TO BE ABLE TO SEE EVERYTHING AND THE AIDS THE CAR HAS TO ALSO LET YOU KNOW THAT SOMEONE IS THERE ARE GREAT
LED HEADLIGHTS WERE A GOOD INVESTMENT
THIS CAR VISIBILTY IS BEST WHEN CHANGING LINE AND TURN LEFT
REAR CAMERA FOR REVERSE IS AN EXCELLENT OPTION TO HAVE
WINDSHIELD WASHER IS POORLY DESIGNED HEADLIGHT WASHERS PROVIDED TOO MUSH PRESSURE SPRAYS ALL OVER THE HOOD AND WINDSHIELD WASHER COMES IN A STREAM NOT SPRAY AND DOESN T ENGAGE UNTIL THE WIPERS HAVE MADE A DRY RUN OVER THE WINDSHIELD
WINDSHIELD FOGS UP WITHOUT A C ON SOME BLIND SPOT DUE TO BAR CONNECTING WINDSHIELD TO FRAME ON DRIVERS SIDE
PREVIOUS TO THIS CAR I HAD ANOTHER MAKE THAT ALLOWED FOR THE DROP DOWN OF THE HEADRES IN THE BACK SEAT WHEN NOT BEING USED THIS FEATURE GAVE A LOT MORE VISIBITY TO THE BACK   REAR WINDOW WHILE DRIVING
LOVE THE WARNING LIGHTS FOR MY BLIND SPOTS
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS WHILE DRIVING BEHIND AND MOSTLY ON THE SIDES THE HEADRESTS GET IN THE WAY OF SEEING VEHICLES COMING FROM THE SIDES AT A STOP SIGN HAVE ALMOST HAD A COUPLE OF ACCIDENTS I WISH THERE WERE AN OPTION FOR SHORTER HEADRESTS O
BACK SEAT HEADRESTS RESTRICT VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT THEY CANNOT BE REMOVED
LOVE THE LARGE WINDOWS AND THE WARNING LIGHTS WHEN A CAR IS NEXT TO YOU
BACK SEAT AIR BAGS ARE OPTIONAL EQUIPMENT NOT STANDARD THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS THEY SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY ON THE PASSENGER SIDE
HEADRESTS BLOCK VIEW FROM REAR VIEW MIRROR THE REAR CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL BUT STILL USE REAR VIEW MIRROR COULD HEADRESTS BE REMOVABLE OR FOLD DOWN INTO SEATS SO VIEW WOULD BE BETTER
ALL WINDOWS ARE SIZE PROPORTIONED TO MINIMIZE BLIND SPOTS
I REALLY LIKE THE HANDLING OF THE SPORT I FEEL I HAVE GOOD CONTROL AND THAT IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY MANEUVER I WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF MAINTAINING CONTROL AFTER THE DEALER INSTALLED HID LIGHTS I AM ABLE TO SEE MUCH BETTER AT NIGHT TRAVELI
LOVE THE SAFETY FEATURES
REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR ON THE SIDE MIRRORS AND THE RANGE OF THE BACKUP CAMERA IS VERY GOOD
WOULD LIKE MORE OPTIONS FOR SURROUND VIEW CAMERA COLLISION WARNING AVOIDANCE ADAPTIVE CRUISE THESE OPTIONS WERE NOT AVAILABLE ON THIS MODEL AND I WOULD HAVE PAID EXTRA FOR THESE FEATURES
TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT ISSUE WHEN LOOKING BACKWARDS CAN T SEE PAST HEAD RESTS AND POST ALSO WHEN USING THE BACKUP CAMERA IT IS TOO EASY TO MISS SEEING A CAR SUDDENLY PAST A WARNING SOUND WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE BACKING OUT
I FELT LIKE TAHOE HAD HORRIBLE BLIND SPOTS I FEEL LIKE THE EXPEDITION HAS NONE I LOVE THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA AND THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AND JUST THE WAY THE WINDOWS ARE VERY EASY TO SEE OUT OF AND FEEL CONFIDENT DRIVING
THERE IS A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT LOOKING IN THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR WITH PEOPLE WITH PEOPLE WITH EYE WEAR LOOKING THOUGH THE PASSENGER MIRROR IS GREAT
VERY LARGE BLIND SPOTS I DEPEND ON MY BLIS SYSTEM TO ALERT ME WHEN CHANGING LANES A LOT
WHEN ENTERING ANOTHER LANE TO LEFT LOOKING FROM SHOULDER IS NOT THAT VISIBLE I THINK THE SIZE OF THE CAR MAKES IT LITTLE DIFFICULT
REAR CAMERA PICKS UP TOO MUCH ROAD FAIL
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON FRONT OF VEHICLE DON T CLEAR WINDSHIELD PROPERLY NEED REPLACING
IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A VISOR THAT EXTENDS BEHIND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THERE ARE FREQUENT OCCASIONS WHEN THE SUN SHINES BETWEEN THE 2 FRONT VISORS
I M SHORT 5 3 I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING PAST THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON MOST CARS SURE ADJUST THE SEAT UP BUT THEN MY HEAD TOUCHES THE ROOF AND I CAN T SEE THE GUAGES
I AM NOT A FAN OF HAVING THE TWO WIND SHIELD WASHERS ON THE HOOD IN SNOW AND ICE I CAN T SPRAY MY WINDSHIELD WHEN I GET TRUCK SPRAY SURELY THERE IS SOME SORT OF HEAT THAT COULD BE ROUTED TO THE AREA UNDER THE WIPER BLADES TO DEFROST AND MELT I
HOLDS A GREAT LINE I GOT TRAILER MIRRORS AND THEY ARE PERFECT
REAR VISIBILITY LIMITED BY LENGTH OF THE TRUCK CREW CAB AND LONG BED I DO NOT THINK OF THIS AS A DESIGN FLAW
REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE IN SEEING AROUND THE VEHICLE THE LARGE MIRROR IS GOOD FOR SEEING LONG DISTANCES BEHIND WHEN ON HIGHWAY LOWER FISH EYED MIRROR IS GREAT WHEN BACKING AROUND CORNERS AND INTO PARKING SPOTS
SIDEWAYS VISIBILITY LEAVES SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED
SLANTED POST BETWEEN WINDSHIELD AND DOOR CREATES A LARGE BLIND SPOT FOR TRAFFIC COMING FROM EITHER SIDE
BETWEEN REAR VIEW AND SIDE VIEW HUGE BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE
THE REAR WINDOW IS VERY SMALL LIMITING THE VISIBILITY OF IT WHEN BACKING UP OR CHECKING YOUR REAR MIRROR
WOULD LIKE AUTOMATIC RAIN SENSING WINDSHIELD WIPERS
GREAT VISIBILITY ALL AROUND
SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE OF VEHCILE
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
WIPERS BLADES COULD BE BETTER SIDE MIRRORS DO NOT COVER BLIND SPOTS
THE BLIND SPOT BETWEEN FRONT WINDOW AND SIDE WINDOWS
WHEN I LOOK THRU THE BACK WINDOW THE IMAGES ARE DISTORTED AT NIGHT A CAR IN BACK LOOKS LIKE IT HAS FOUR HEADLIGHTS
I HAD BOTH A FRONT CAMERA AND SONAR FOR PARKING WITH THEM THE TRUCK DRIVES PERFECTLY FORD SHOULD HAVE THAT AS AN OPTION FOR FUTURE YEARS
OTHER THAN WISHING I HAD THE SAFETY FEATURE THAT LETS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU RE GETTING TO CLOSE TO AN OBJECT WHEN BACKING UP THE ONE COMMENT I HAVE ON THE VISIBILITY IS THAT WHEN LOOKING OUT OF THE CENTRAL REAR VIEW MIRROR I FEEL AS THOUGH I CAN ONL
BECAUSE MY PHONE IS PAIRED WITH THE BLUETOOTH SYSTEM IT WILL NOT ALLOW MESSAGE TONE TO BE PLAYED I NOTICED THIS WHILE RIDING IN THE CAR NOT DRIVING AND REALIZE THAT ITS A GREAT FEATURE FOR WHEN YOU ARE THE DRIVER BUT THERE SHOULD BE A WAY TO T
BLIS SYSTEM NEEDS MORE AUDIBLE WARNING I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HUD ON WINDSHIELD FROM SIDE MIRROR CAMERAS ON EACH SIDE AS ADDITIONAL SAFETY FEATURE YOU COULD SEE SIDE  BLIND SPOTS WHILE STILL LOOKING AHEAD
FORWARD VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD THE WIPERS DO A GOOD JOB OF CLEANING OFF THE MAJORITY OF THE WINDSHIELD
THE CEILING SIDE A LITTLE LOW FOR VISIBILITY
MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE HAD AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT MY FIESTA I FOUND MYSELF DRIVING IN THE DARK MY FAULT BECAUSE I WASN T USE TO HAVING TO MANUALLY TURN THEM ON AGAIN I KNOW THE FIESTA IS AN INEXPENSIVE COMPACT BUT INCLUDING
I REALLY LOVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
THE AIR PILLAR NO LONER HAVE THE SIS MIRROR ATTACHED IMPROVES VISIBILITY
SMALL BLIND SPOT OUTSIDE DRIVER FRONT WINDOW WHEN YOU ARE MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY INSTALLED ARE NOT TOO EFFECTIVE WITH VISIBILITY WHEN IT WAS SNOWING I HAD TO CONTINUE TO USE THE WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID TO REMOVE BUILD UP ON THE GLASS THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER DOESN T HAVE THIS ISSUE WH
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE OUT THE WINDOWS TO BACK UP I LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA AND SCREEN BUT WANT TO ALSO BE ABLE TO SEE BEHIND ME WHEN BACKING UP THE HEADLIGHTS SEEM TO FACE THE GROUND TOO MUCH WISH THEY WERE ADJUSTABLE LIKE MY NISSAN MURANO
I THINK THAT DAY RUNNING LIGHTS SHOULD BE INSTALLED ON THE SEL MODELS
SOMETIMES THE SIDE MIRRORS DO NOT DETECT CAR IN BLIND SPOT AND THE WARNING LIGHT IN THE MIRROR IS HARD TO SEE
I THINK THE REAR WINDOW WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY WITH A WINDSHIELD WIPER SINCE THEY HAVE IT AT A ALMOST HORIZONTAL ANGLE A MORE VERTICAL WINDOW WOULD GIVE GREATER VISIBILITY
DRIVER SIDE BLINDSPOT IS SOMETHING YOU REALLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHEN DRIVING THIS CAR NOT A BIG DEAL FOR ME BECAUSE I ALWAYS LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER BUT LOTS OF DRIVERS RELY ON SIDE MIRROR AND I VE NOTICED THAT IT S NOT VERY EFFECTIVE ON T
PASSENGER SIDE HEADREST LIMITS SIDE VISION I ALSO LOWERED REAR SET HEADRESTS TO IMPROVE REAR VISION
GOOD THING IT COMES WITH A REAR VIEW CAMERA I CAN T SEE MUCH OUT THE BACK WINDOW
VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN COMPETITORS
NEED LARGER SIDE MIRRORS OR A REAR CAMERA FOR FORWARD TRAVEL TOO TIGHT BACKLIGHT AND HEADRESTS INTERFERE WITH VIEW OUT LANE CHANGE IS HAMPERED BY POOR VISIBILITY
NOT THE BEST CAR REGARDING VISIBILITY THAT I HAVE DRIVEN
SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOTS AT RIGHT AND LEFT FRONT DUE TO WIDE NOSE
VERY GOOD VISABILITY
BLIND SPOTS WHILE CHANGING LANES MORE DIFFICULT THAN PAST VEHICLES OWNED
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS IN THE VEHICLE
SIDE VISIBLE IS VIRTUALLY NON EXISTANT PASSENGER SEAT HEADREST BLOCKS SIDE WINDOW WHILE THE 2ND ROW HEADREST BLOCKS THE 3RD WINDOWS
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE SMALL AND WOULD PROBABLY BENEFIT FROM A CAMERA ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OTHERWISE THE LIGHTS AND GENERAL VISIBILITY IS GREAT
SIDE MIRRORS HAVE BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP EVEN WITH BACK UP CAMERA
LOVE THE WARNINGS OF OTHER VEHICLES THAT ARE IN MY BLIND SPOT LIGHT ON SIDE MIRRORS AS WELL AS ALARMS
FEWER BLIND SPOTS THAN MY MUSTANG
MY ONLY SAFETY FACTOR IS THAT AFTER APPLYIJG BRAKE AND STOPPING AND TTAKING FOOT OFF BRAKES AND TURNING OFF ENGINE IT WILL EITHER GO FORWARD OR BACKWARDS AN INCH OR TWO
MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY THAN THE CAMARO
THIS CAR DOES WHAT I WANT WHEN I WANT IT TO I LOVE IT WE TRADED IN OUT TAURUS BECAUSE OF VISIBILITY PROBLEMS NO PROBLEMS NOW
HEADLIGHTS ARE JUST BARELY ADEQUATE AND HIGH BEAMS ARE INADEQUATE VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE AUTOMATIC RUNNING LIGHTS ON WHENEVER VEHICLE IS RUNNING
HAS A SLIGHTLY LARGER BLIND SPOT THAN THE 2001 MODEL I PREVIOUSLY DROVE
GOOD THING THERE IS A BACKUP CAMERA OR YOU D REALLY BE IN TROUBLE
BLIND SPOT MIRROR NO GOOD
HAVING THE REAR CAMERA DEFINITELY HELPS IN ASSISTING THE USE OF MIRRORS AND BACK GLASS WHEN GOING IN REVERSE BECAUSE OF THE HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE AND THE BULK OF THE BED I FIND THE REAR CAMERA A NECESSITY IN MAKING JUDGEMENTS BY FILLING IN THE G
I WOULD PREFER A BLIND SPOT MIRROR IN THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR LIKE THE ONE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE I THOUGHT IT UNUSUAL TO HAVE THAT BLIND SPOT MIRROR ONLY ON THE DRIVER S SIDE
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGER THAN I M USED TO BUT I THINK THAT S JUST RELATIVE TO MY HEIGHT AND POSITION IN THE PICKUP
WOULD LIKE A VISOR THAT EXTENDS A BIT LOWER
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BACKUP WARNING SOUND IN ADDITION TO THE BACKUP CAMERA
REAR VIEW MIRROR CAUSES A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT WITH VEHICLES COMMING FROM THE RIGHT
THE SEAT VIBRATES AS AN ALERT AS WELL AS THE FLASHING RED LIGHTS LEFT SIDE VIBRATES WHEN MOVING OUT OF LANE UNLESS TURN SIGNAL IS ON INDICATING THE ENGINEER S BEHIND THE COLLISION ALERT SYSTEM USED SOME SENSE AND CREATIVITY
HEADLIGHT BULBS ARE TERRIBLE
A BIT HARD TO SEE RIGHT REAR BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ADDRESS A LOT BUT COULD BE BETTER
WARNING INDICATOR FOR OTHER VEHICLES ANY TECH FORWARD SAFETY FEATURES THAT LOWER INSURANCE RATES WHILE PROVIDING HIGH END SAFETY FEATURES AT A REASONABLE INTRODUCTORY LEVEL
LOW BEAMS HAVE A DISTINCT CUT OFF AND I M SOMETIMES LEFT FEELING THAT I DON T HAVE ENOUGH FORWARD LIGHTING VISIBILITY WHEN USING MY LOW BEAMS IN A COUNTRY RURAL SETTING I KNOW I CAN USE THE HIGH BEAMS TOO BUT THAT S NOT FAIR TO ONCOMING TRAFFIC
IWISH I HAD ADDED COLLISION AVOIDANCE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ALWAYS ON REAR CAMERA ABILITY BEHIND MY TRAILER I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE EXTENDABLE REARVIEW SIDE MIRRORS FOR TOWING
SEEMS LIKE THE SAFETY WARNINGS ABOUT DRIVING THAT COME UP ON THE DISPLAY THAT REQUIRE USER RESPONSE SHOULD DISPLAY ONLY WHEN PARKED STOPPED UNNEEDED DISTRACTION
I FEEL THAT THE SMALLED MIRROR IS NEEDED ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN IT COMES TO CHANGING LANES I FEEL THAT I CAN SEE ALL THE WAY AROUND THE TRUCK OTHER THAN THE BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHILE DRIVING
CANNOT CHECK BLIND SPOT DRIVER HEAD REST IN THE WAY FRONT BAR HOLDING WINDSHIELD IS IN THE WAY TO CLEARLY SEE TRAFFIC
LOVE THE SIDE MIRRORS FOR VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE LARGER THAN ID LIKE
FROM DRIVER S SEAT THERE IS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO SEE BEYOND THE TOP OF THE HOOD ON THE PASSENGER SIDE
AS STATER BEFORE THE HEADLIGHTS ARE TOO DIM OTHERWISE I WOULD GIVE SAFETY FEATURES AN OUTSTANDING GRADE
FACTORY HEADLIGHT BULBS ARE TERRIBLE THEY ARE BORDERLINE A SAFETY ISSUE IMO GM SHOULD HAVE TO RECALL THEM I HAVE GREAT VISION AND HAVE HAD TO SWITCH THE FACTORY BULBS OUT TO AN HID STYLE
COULD IMPROVE HEADLIGHTS
IT S GOT MORE SAFETY FEATURES THAN I EXPECTED THE VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S PERSPECTIVE IS EXCELLENT I DON T SIT IN THE BACK SEAT BUT PEOPLE TELL ME THE HEADRESTS BLOCK FORWARD VISIBILITY THE VISORS COULD BE A BIT LONGER WHEN MOVED TO COVER
AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY THE OVERSIZED SIDE MIRRORS ARE GREAT FOR TOWING BUT THEY DO CREATE A BLIND SPOT AT TIMES
BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT WHEN MAKING LEFT TURN
GREAT VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY THE WINDSHIELD
VEHICLE BELT LINE HIGH MAKING REAR VISIBILITY DIFFICULT
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS NOT MUCH USEFUL WINDOWS TO SEE OUT OF ON THE SIDES OF THE CAR AND ITS A STRAIN TO POSITION RIGHT TO SEE ANYTHING THAT PART IS DANGEROUS AND NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON WHY THEY TOOK AWAY THE BLIND DRIVERS LITTLE MIRRORS ARE BEYOND
I THINK THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS GREAT I NEVER SOLELY RELY ON IT BUT AS AN ADDITIVE IT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE POSSIBLE OBSTACLES NEAR THE BUMPER OF YOUR VEHICLE THAT YOU COULDN T POSSIBLY SEE JUST BY LOOKING AT YOUR REAR VIEW MIRROR OR REAR WINDOW AL
I FIND THAT THE FRONT WINDOW PANELS CAUSE TERRIBLE BLIND SPOTS AT INTERSECTIONS
A BLIND SPOT IS CREATED BY THE PILLARS BETWEEN THE FRONT DOOR AND WINDSHIELD THE ANGLE AND WIDTH OF THE PILLARS COVER A SIGNIFICANT AREA
THE VISIBILITY ISSUE IS A HUGE CONCERN I DON T KNOW IF IT IS JUST MY SEAT POSITION BUT EVERY SUPPORT BEAM IS IN THE WAY OF SEEING SIDE TRAFFIC SO THE EARLY DETECTION IS A MUST BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT IS A CRAP SHOOT IF I WILL BE SWIPED B
GOOD VISIBILITY DUE TO HEIGHT OF VEHICLE
REPEAT OF REAR CAMERA AND WINDSHEID COVERED BY DIRT LACK OF MUD FLAPS
PILLAR BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR DOORS BLOCKS VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES NO WINDOW TINT TOP OF FRONT WINDOW
THE TURN SIGNALS IN THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS ARE DISTRACTING TO THE DRIVER WOULD BUY OPTION OF BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
TOWING MIRRORS CREATE A LARGE BLIND SPOT IN FORWARD SIDE VISION HEADLIGHT BRIGHTNESS IS THE POOREST I HAVE EVER EVER SEEN DRIVING IN THE DARK HAS BECOME A BATTLE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THAT TRUCK SAFETY OVERALL IS GREAT BUT HEADLIGHT BRIGHTNESS
THE HEAD LIGHTS ARE TERRIBLE OUR TOYOTA COROLLA HAS BETTER NIGHT VISIBILITY THAN OUR DID I SAY EXPENSIVE PICKUP TRUCK DEALERSHIP SAYS NOTHING WE CAN DO AS THIS TIME
THE HEADLAMPS ARE AWFUL AND A HAZARD THEY ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH ALSO FOR A TOP OF THE LINE DENALI THEY SHOULD HAVE BLIND SIDE WARNING DETECTION
BECAUSE OF THE COMPACTNESS OF THE CAR YOUR VISIBILITY ON THE SIDES WILL BE WORSE THAN AVERAGE BUT THEY COMPENSATE FOR THIS WAS THE MODIFIED SIDE MIRROR
I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE BIG BLIND SPOTS WHEN DRIVING WITH THE CABRIOLET ROOF UP AND EVEN BIGGER ONES WHEN IT IS DOWN IT S MY ONE BIGGEST COMPLAINT ABOUT THE CAR
THIS TRUCK S GREAT HEIGHT AND BIG BLACK NOSE MAKE THIS TRUCK HIGHLY VISIBLE FEW PEOPLE VENTURE TO PULL OUT IN FRONT OF ME
BLIND SPOTS ON SIDE AND REAR OF VEHICLE CHANGING LANES
BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT BACK SIDE
SIDE MIRROR VIEW BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER S REAR LEFT SIDE
BLIND SPOTS AT B PILLAR
THE DRIVER S SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A TWO PIECE DESIGN I WISH IT WERE ONE LARGE MIRROR IT S DIFFICULT USING TWO SMALL PIECES ONE OF THE WORST FEATURES ON THE CAR I WISH THE WIPERS HAD MULTIPLE INTERMITTENT SPEEDS
PASSENGER SIDE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPER IS WAY TOO SHORT MECHANISM MUST BE REDESIGNED AS NOT ENOUGH OF THE WINDOW IS CLEARED FOR EITHER THE PASSENGER OR FOR THE DRIVER VIEWING SOMETHING THROUGH THE PASSENGER SIDE
FRONT PILLAR DESIGN ALONG WITH LARGE SIDE MIRROR CREATES A DRIVER S BLIND SPOT TO LEFT CENTER
I AM LEARNING TO TRUST THE BACKUP CAMERA
WHILE TOP S DOWN REAR VISIBILITY IMPEDED
THE REAR CAMERA IS EASILY DIRTIED AND CAN T BE USED FOR BACKING UP THE LARGE POST BEHIND THE REAR DOORS CAUSES BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP AND CHANGING LANES THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND REAR WINDOW ARE LARGE AND EASY TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR AND
HARD TO SEE OTHER CARS ON DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT
THE BACKSEAT HEADRESTS ARE AN IMPEDIMENT TO REAR VISIBILITY
I M SHORTER BUT I FIND THAT VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT
ON THE DRIVERS SIDE THERE IS A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT
SUN VISORS NEED EXTENDERS
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE TRYING TO SEE WHEN I LOOK BACK TO SEE IF THERE S CARS TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT
SUN VISORS DO NOT COVER AS MUCH AS I WOULD LIKE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF SUN WE HAVE HERE I LIKE SITTING UP HIGHER THAN A SEDAN FOR BETTER VISIBILITY BACK UP CAMERA IS USEFUL BUT HARD TO GET USED TO HEADLIGHTS ARE THE BEST I HAVE EVER
THE HEADLIGHTS HAVE A GREAT DESIGN BECAUSE THEY FAN OUT TO THE SIDES THE HEADLIGHTS ON LOW BRIGHTNESS ARE OK BUT THE BRIGHT SETTING IS AMAZING THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS CAN TAKE A LITTLE GETTING USED TO
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT RECOGNITION BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT OTHERWISE LOVE THE HID HEADLIGHTS
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS ON DRIVERS SIDE
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS IN SUCH A LARGE VEHICLE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL ALWAYS
1 DUAL SUN VISORS FOR DRIVER AND PASSENGER 2 REDESIGN REAR FOR BETTER AIR FLOW REAR WINDOW GETS DIRTIER THAN ANY VEHICLE I VE DRIVEN
HEADRESTS CAUSE HUGE BLIND SPOTS IN PERIPHERAL AND REAR VIEW VISIONS
EXHAUST SHOULD BE SIDE DISCHARGE AS IN THE PAST REAR DISCHARGE ON COLD MORNINGS MAKES VISIBILITY OUT REAR WINDOW LESS THAN DESIRABLE
WITH HEADLIGHTS IN THE LOW POSITION THERE IS A DEFINITE HORIZONTAL LINE BETWEEN WHAT IS VISIBLE AND WHAT ISN T BELOW THE LINE IS VISIBLE ILLUMINATED ABOVE THE LINE IS TOTALLY DARK INSTEAD OF GRADUALLY DIMMING WITH DISTANCE HIGH BEAMS ARE GREAT
I FEEL THAT THE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT
BLIND SPOT INDICATORS WILL HELP WITH CHANGING LANES THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE SMALL AND NOT TERRIBLY USEFUL THERE IS A BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE THAT IS TOO SMALL TO SHOW ANYTHING
COULD ADD BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
I AM VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY
LARGE BLIND SPOTS WHEN SHIFTING LANES MAJOR VISIBILITY PROBLEM FROM C PILLAR WHEN BACKING FROM DIAGONAL PARKING OR PULLING FROM DIAGONAL EGRESS LANE
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE A HIT THEY CROSS IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL UNISON MOTION AND BOTH MY WIFE AND I THINK THIS IS GREAT THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AND RIGHT LANE BLIND SPOT CAMERA ARE BOTH APPRECIATED TOO
LOVE THE RIGHT LANE SIDE CAMERA WISH IT HAD PARK ASSIST
ONE WOULD THINK HONDA COULD COME UP W BETTER WINDSHIELD WIPERS
THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT GIVEN THE WIDTH OF THE SIDEWALL BETWEEN THE 2ND AND 3RD ROW SEATS THANKFULLY THERE IS THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR WHILE DRIVING BUT WHEN TURNING LEFT IT IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE ONCOMING TRAFFIC FROM THE RIGHT
LOVE THE SIDE CAMERA WILL ALWAYS BUY A CAR WITH IT
THE PASSENGER SIDE LANE ASSIST CAMERA THAT GOES ON AUTOMATICALLY WHEN USING THE TURN SIGNAL FOR CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT IS A GREAT FEATURE
OVERALL EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY
MY VEHICLE HAS THE WINDOW RAIN GUARDS THEY ARE HORRIBLE AS THEY ARE BLIND SPOTS YOU REALLY NEED TO MOVE AROUND A LOT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE CLEAR TO PROCEED I MAY HAVE THEM REMOVED THEY WERE AN EXTRA FEATURE ON THE VEHICLE THAT IT CAME WITH
LIKE THE PASSENGER SIDE LANE CHANGE CAMERA
RIGHT LANE VISIBILITY IS GREAT BECAUSE OF THE CAMERAS LEFT LANE CHANGES NOT SO MUCH SIDE VIEW MIRROR COULD BE IMPROVED
I WISH THE CAMERA CAME ON WHEN YOU TURNED ON THE LEFT BLINKER LIKE IT DOES ON THE RIGHT SIDE
BEST VISIBILITY OF ANY CAR HAVE OWNED PASSENGERS COMMENT HOW EASY IT IS TO SEE OUT
I WISH THERE WAS A CAMERA ON THE LEFT OUTSIDE MIRROR I AM VERY SHORT AND THE SUN VISORS ARE TOO HIGH TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR ME
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE THE SIDE CAMERA IS NOT REALLY HELPFUL I DON T TRUST IT
JUST THE HEADLIGHTS ARE MUCH TOO DIM AND NO FOG LIGHTS IS NOT GOOD
LOVE THE LANE WATCH CAMERA YOU SHOULD ADD ONE FOR THE LEFT SIDE TOO
THE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA THAT IS INTEGRAL WITH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SHOWS AN EXCELLENT VIEW OF TRAFFIC IN THE RIGHT LANE WHEN THE RIGHT TURN SIGNAL IS ENGAGED
ALL THE EXTRA WINDOWS ADD TO THE VISIBILITY
PILLARS ARE BULKY AND CAUSE BLIND SPOT BLACK SCREENING ABOVE REARVIEW BLOCKS ANGLES FOR TURNING
ON LEFT SIDE VIEW MIRROR I ATTACHED ADDITIONAL LITTLE MIRROR TO WATCH NON VISIBLE SPOTS
REALLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE HEADLIGHTS WHEN YOU GO TO TURN YOU CAN T SEE ANYTHING LATERALLY YOU ARE TURNING INTO THE DARK FOG LIGHTS HELP A BIT BUT THE FRONT LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE POOR
NEEDS LANE CHANGE CAMERA ON BOTH SIDES R AND L
THE SIDE LANE CHANGE CAMERA IS OUTSTANDING AND MOSTLY MAKES UP FOR THE LACK OF DIRECT VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
WHEN THE REAR HEADRESTS ARE UP THE REAR VISION IS SIGNIFICANTLY BLOCKED
VISIBILITY A HUGE PROBLEM IF DRIVING INTO STRONG SUNLIGHT AND AN ANNOYANCE IF THE SUN IS SHINING ON THE DRIVER THROUGH THE SIDE WINDOW WHICH THE VISOR IS NOT ABLE TO SHIELD AND PROVIDE ENOUGH PROTECTION
I REALLY LIKE THE PASSENGER SIDE LANE CAMERA WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SAME OPTION ON THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR AS WELL
IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE BLIND SPOT OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER
THE SUN VISORS AREN T AS EFFECTIVE AS I WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING TO THE RIGHT DUE TO THE SIDE WINDSHIELD FRAME AND I HAVE MISSED SEEING VEHICLES COMING UP BEHIND ME ON THE RIGHT UNTIL THEY ARE TOO CLOS
PERHAPS BECAUSE I AM ONLY 5 2 I FIND I HAVE TO STRETCH TO DETERMINE WHERE THE FRONT BUMPERS ARE WHEN PARALLEL PARKING
THE FRONT WINDOW PILLARS HAS SORT OF A BLIND SPOT
LARGE WINDOWS SURROUND THE VAN THE SIDE DETECTION ADDS IN BLIND SPOT DETETCTION WHEN CHANGING LANES BETWEEN THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THE WINDOWS THERE S NO WAY TO NOT SEE WHERE YOU RE GOING
REAR VIEW CAMERA IS GREAT CONVENIENCE SIDE CAMERA IS GREAT BUT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE ON LEFT AS WELL
WHEN THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS ARE UP THERE IS ALMOST NO VISIBILITY IN THE REAR BLIND SPOTS
CAR DOESN T HAVE SIDE LANE CAMERA STILL HAS BLINDSPOT ON OTHER SIDE BUT ALL CARS HAVE THIS
THERE IS A BIG BLIND SPOT BETWEEN THE FRONT WIND SHIELD AND THE FRONT DOORS
FRONT FACING [FORWARD] VISIBILITY IS REALLY GOOD AS IS DRIVER S LEFT RIGHT VISIBILITY
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME TYPE OF CAMERA ON THE LEFT SIDE MIRROR TO AID IN MAKING LEFT LANE CHANGES
WORST FROM FACTORY WINDSHIELD WIPERS I HAVE EVER HAD THEY NEVER WORKED GOOD AND NEED TO BE REPLACED BEFORE 2500 MILES
THERE ARE CERTAIN BLIND SPOTS BUT OVERALL EXCELLENT FRONT VISIBILITY
THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE BLIND SPOTS S I APPRECIATE THE WARNING SYSTEMS
LOVE THE CAMERA WISH IT WENT ON WITH LEFT TURN SIGNAL TOO
I LOVE HOW WELL I CAN SEE I JUST WISH I COULD BETTER DETERMINE WHERE THE FRONT OF THE CAR STARTS ESPECIALLY WITH IT BEING SO LOW TO THE GROUND I OFTEN ACCIDENTLY SCRATCH THE FRONT FENDER ON THE CURB AS I PARK WHICH BOTHERS ME I WISH I COULD
BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT SIDE FOR LANE CHANGING
VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS PROBABLY THE ASPECT I LIKE THE LEAST I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT ALL PILOTS COME EQUIPPED WITH SENSORS FOR CHANGING LANES
REAR WIPER NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
BACK UP CAMERA MAKES IT HARD TO JUDGE DISTANCE OF THINGS BEHIND VEHICLE
SIDE VISIBILITY IS TERRIBLE THEY INCLUDED IN MY MODEL THE RIGHT SIDE CAMERA BUT NOT THE LEFT SIDE THE POSSIBILITY IN ALL MODELS SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED THE WARNING SYSTEMS SHOULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE IN ALL MODELS ALSO THE AVAILABILITY OF
MY VISIBILITY ISSUES ARE BECAUSE I M SHORT 4 11
NEEDED TO ADD AFTER MARKET BLIND SPOT MIRRORS TO MY SIDE MIRRORS TO ENHANCE VISIBILITY CR Z HAS LARGE BLIND SPOTS AT THE SIDES
IMPROVE VISIBILITY ON DRIVERS SIDE WHEN SWITCHING LANES
EXCELLENT SIDE VISIBILITY USING SIDE MIRRORS
FEEL THAT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVERS SEAT TO REAR AND SIDE
WINDOWS ARE LARGE AND GIVE GOOD VISIBILITY
PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR HAS BLIND SPOTS COULD USE A CONVEX MIRROR ON PASSENGER SIDE AS WELL AS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
THE WIPERS DON T REACH THE WHOLE WINDOW THERE IS ONE SPOT BY THE PASSENGER SIDE THAT THE WIPER NEVER GETS TO IT IT IS BETWEEN THE 2 WIPER BLADES
AS BEFORE POOR VISIBILITY OVER DRIVER S LEFT SHOULDER AND NEEDS REAR WINDOW WIPER
THE QUESTION ABOUT VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES HAS ME THINKING OF THE ENHANCED DRIVER SIDE MIRROR THAT HAS THIS SPLIT FEATURE THAT I GUESS IS SUPPOSED TO HELP WITH CHANGING LANES I DON T THINK IT DOES INITIALLY I FOUND
BLIND SPOT DETECTION IS A VERY USEFUL SAFETY SYSTEM FOR FREEWAY LANE CHANGING ESPECIALLY TO THE RIGHT
FOR THE $47000 I PAID THE FOG LIGHTS WHICH ARE A GREAT HELP SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS WE AGE WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET TO MAINTAIN SAFE DRIVING
THE LITTLE BLIND SPOT MIRROR WITHIN THE DRIVER S SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS GREAT HOWEVER SINCE THERE IS NOT ONE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE VIEW MIRROR IT IS A BIT SCARY SOMETIMES CHANGING LANES
AREA COVERED BY THE FRONT REVIEW MIRROR TAKES AWAY VISIBILITY
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BIG I WISH MY REARVIEW MIRROR SHOWED MY DIRECTION AS THE COMPASS ON THE NAV SCREEN IS SMALL AND ONLY DESIGNATES NORTH ALSO I WISH I HAD REAR WIPERS
SEE PREVIOUS COMMENTS ON WINDSHIELD WIPERS
LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
WHEN RAINING WHEN SLOWING TO A STOP THE WATER ON THE HOOD FLOWS OFF THE FRONT OF THE HOOD AND BLOWS BACK UP ONTO THE WINDSHIELD THE REAR CAMERA DOESN T WORK WELL WHEN RAINING DROPS STAY ON THE CAMERA GLOBE AND MAKE THE VIDEO DISTORT
MY WIFE AND I NOTICED THTA THE PILOT SEEMED TO HAVE MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY FOR DRIVER AND PASSENGER THAN OTHER CARS WE TEST DROVE
THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO LARGE AND BLOCK VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING LEFT SAME CAN BE SAID OF THE SIDE CORNERS FROM ROOF TO DOOR
AGAIN THE BLIND SPOTS THRU THE WINDSHIED WHEN MAKING TURNS
VISIBILITY OUT BACK WINDOW IS SOMEWHAT LIMIT COMPARED TO EARLY MODEL CARS I GUESS THIS IS DUE TO STYLING TRENDS
WOULD LIKE FOG LIGHTS
BAD WIPER BLADES
THERE ARE LARGE BLIND SPOTS WHEN TURNING
BLIND SPOT AND FORWARD WARNING IS AWESOME
IN COLD TEMPS WINDSHIELD WIPER DUCTS GATHER LOTS OF ICE WITH THEIR PLACEMENT MAKING THEM HARD TO REACH AND CLEAN THEREFORE UNABLE TO USE FLUID FOR LONG DURATIONS AT TIMES
WOULD PREFER DIRECTIONAL HEADLIGHTS THIS MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE
THE CAR NEEDS A BACKUP CAMERA
SEEMS LIKE THIS YEARS STYLING PROVIDES MORE BLIND SPOTS BUT THE WARNING SYSTEMS BUILT IN ARE A HUGE HELP VERY EFFECTIVE
THE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHT FUNCTION DOES NOT FUNCTION BELOW 35 MPH THIS IS TRULY ANNOYING SINCE THAT IS WHEN I WANT IT TO WORK THIS CAUSES EXTRA STEPS IN TURNING HIGH BEAMS ON AND OFF SUN VISORS COULD USE AND EXTENSION TO MAKE THEM MORE EFFECTIVE
SIDE MIRRORS SOMETIME MAKE FOR A BLIND SPOT
REAR VISIBILITY CAN BE IMPROVED THE REAR DECK LID SEEMS HIGH WHEN VIEWED FROM INSIDE
SMALL WINDOWS AND LOW SEATING POSITION MAKE URBAN AND LOW VISIBILITY NIGHT SNOW RAIN DRIVING MORE STRESSFUL HIGHWAY AND DAYTIME DRIVING IS FINE CAR HAS A GOOD SOLID SAFE FEEL UNDER ALL CONDITIONS
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXTENTIONS IN THE SUN VISOR TO BLOCK THE CENTER AREA BEHING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW AND TO THE SIDES COULD BE BETTER BUT THERE ARE SENSORS AND WARNING SYSTEMS THAT TAKE AWAY ANY ANXIETY OVER IT
IT DEFINITLEY HAS BLIND SPOTS
REAR VIEW CAMERA MUST BE INSTALLED WITH TILTING SIDE VIEW MIRRORS WHEN BACKING UP A GOOD FEATURE TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE LINES OF A PARKING SPACE HYUNDAI DO NOT BE CHEAP
LARGE BLIND SPOT TO RIGHT FRONT DON T LIKE LINE DEPARTURE SYSTEM PULLING CAR INTO LANE SO TURNED IT OFF HARD TO SEE TO BACK OF VEHICLE SO REALLY RELYING ON BACKUP CAMERA REALLY LIKE BACKUP CAMERA YELLOW & RED GUIDE MARKINGS
BLIND SPOT WARNING IS GREAT
I HATE THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS AND THE LINES OF THE BODY @ THE HOOD MAKE DEPTH PERCEPTION DIFFICULT TO GET USED TO THE SHORT SIDE WINDOW OFFER LESS THAN AVERAGE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES
I HAD TO TRAIN MYSELF TO BE SURE TO USE THE SMALL WIDE ANGLE DRIVER S SIDE VIEW INSET MIRROR TO ASSURE NOTHING IS IN MY DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA IS A REAL ASSET FOR BACKING PARKING
I WISH THERE WAS A BLIND SPOT INSET MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER REAR VIEW WINDOW EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
BLIND SPOT SENSOR EXTENDS COVERAGE TOO FAR BACK TO CARS I CAN SEE IN MY REAR VIEW MIRROR
REAR VISIBILITY IS A BIT IMPAIRED BUT WHEN GETTING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT THE REAR VIEW CAMERA HELPS A LOT
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS DRIVER VISION
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON BOTH PASSENGER AND DRIVER MIRROR
I REALLY LIKE THE FULL VIEW FROM WINDSHIELD I ALSO LIKE THE LITTLE MIRROR THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR I WOULD RECOMMEND THE SAME ON THE PASSENGER SIDE THIS REALLY HELPS WITH VISION OF BLIND SPOTS ALTHOUGH I STILL LEAN FORWAR
SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON PASSENGER SIDE NOT JUST DRIVERS SIDE
SAFETY WAS OUR TOP PRIORITY IN BUYING THIS CAR IT HAD THE BEST SAFETY FEATURES WE COULD FIND HENCE MY TRULY EXCEPTIONAL RATING
NO FOG LIGHTS AVAILABLE ON MY ULTRA AWD SERIOUS DISAPPOINTMENT
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT I DON T WORRY ABOUT BLIND SPOTS ETC FURTHERMORE I HAVE NEVER HAD A VEHICLE BEFORE WHERE THE SUN VISORS WERE USEFUL SINCE I M A BIT SHORT BUT IN THE SANTA FE THEY ACTUALLY WORK FOR ME AND HONESTLY I M GRATEFUL FOR THAT
THE HEAD RESTS ON BACK SEATS ARE TOO HIGH THEY TEND TO ALLOW GOOD VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW
BAD BLIND SPOT WITH PASSENGER IN FRONT PASSINGER SEAT
HID HEADLIGHTS AND DRIVING LIGHTS SHOULD BE THE STANDARD NOT THE EXCEPTION THE VEHICLE HAS TO MANY BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOT TURNING LEFT DUE TO MIRROR FRONT PILLAR LOCATION HARD TO SEE ROAD GAP ON WIPERS COVERAGE IN FRONT OF PASSENGER
THIS CAR SEEMS TO HAVE A LARGER BLIND SPOT THAN MOST VEHICLES WHEN SLOWING TO ALLOW OTHER LANES TO MERGE IT IS VERY EASY TO LOSE THE CAR FROM MIRRORS AND HAVE TO CRANE YOUR NECK TO FIND THEM
OVERALL VERY GOOD VISIBILITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SIDE REAR CARGO COMPARTMENT WINDOWS WHICH ARE TINY AND VIRTUALLY USELESS
ADJACENT LANE WARNING DEVICES IN SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE EXCEPTIONAL SAFETY FEATURE THE BACKUP CAMERA ALSO IS VERY EFFECTIVE AND HELPFUL
THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR IS QUITE EFFECTIVE
I HAVE REALLY ENJOYED HAVING THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S MIRROR THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE VEHICLE
THE DESIGN ALLOWS FULL VISIBILITY IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WITHOUT THE HOOD OBSTRUCTING ANYTHING LIKE ON SOME OTHER VEHICLES
I HAVE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES AND DEPEND ON MY SIDE MIRROWS WHEN LOOKING BACK WHICH WORKS VERY WELL I ALSO HAVE BLIND SPOTS WHEN TURNING I HAVE TO LOOK TWO OR THREE TIMES TO MAKE SURE I HAVEN T MISSED A CAR WHICH I DID WHEN I FIRST
BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY TO PASSENGER SIDE LANE IS POORER THAN I M USED TO COULD USE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ATTACHMENT ON THAT SIDE TOO ALSO THE COMPLETELY OPEN DRIVER SIDE WINDOW IS RATHER HIGH UP COMPARED TO THE SEAT MAKING IT AWKWARD TO ACC
PASSENGER SIDE SIDE VIEW MIRROR NEEDS A MAGNIFYING SPOT THERE IS A VERY LARGE BLIND SPOT REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE TOO SMALL NARROW PASSENGER SIDE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS GET IN THE WAY
WHEN TURNING THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ON THE CAR
WISH I HAD GOTTEN THE LANE CHANGING WARNING SYSTEM
THE BLIND SPOT IN THE OTHER SONATAS WE VED HAD HAS BEEN MUCH WORSE THAN THIS ONE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR ON THE SIDE MIRROR HELPS
AUTO SENSING WIPERS DO NOT WORK PROPERLY IN WEATHER CONDITIONS WIPERS DID NOT SENSE THE AMOUNT OF PRECIPITATION ON WINDSHIELD VISIBILITY WAS SO POOR WHILE WAITING FOR WIPERS TO SWIPE THAT FINALLY USED MANUAL VERY DISAPPOINTING ESPECIALLY SIN
I DON T UNDERSTAND AND NEITHER DID THE DEALER WHY FOG LIGHTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON AWD MODEL BUT AVAILABLE ON THE V 8 VERSION IT MAKES NOE SENSE WHATSOEVER
I HAVE HAD PROBLEMS SEEING THE LANE MARKINGS AND CURBS WHEN MAKING LEFT TURNS AT INTERSECTIONS BECAUSE OF THE REARVIEW MIRROR BLOCKING MY VISION MY DRIVERS SEAT IS AS HIGH AS IT WILL GO I HAVE TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS OF ANYTHING IN THAT BLIND SPOT
DRIVER ASSIST SAFETY SYSTEMS ARE EXCEPTIONAL
SIDE VIEW MIRROR ON DRIVERS SIDE PARTIALLY HINDERS VISABILITY WWHEN MAKING LEFT TURN
HORRIBLE PASSENGER BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE IS SITTING IN PASSENGER SEAT PLEASE FIX OR PUT BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON PASSENGER SIDE OF CAR LOVE MY BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON DRIVER SIDE WISH I HAD ONE ON PASSENGER SIDE
IT APPEARS AS IF THIS VEHICLE HAS A LARGER BLIND SPOT AREA THE BLIND SPOT DETECTORS DO HELP WITH THIS MOST OF THE TIME HOWEVER SOMETIMES EVEN THE SENSORS DO NOT CATCH OTHER VEHICLES WITHIN THE AREA WHICH COULD CREATE A PROBLEM WITH SOMEONE IF T
WISH MY MODEL CAME WITH CONVEX MIRROR BUILT IN
HARD TO SEE WHEN YOU PARK NEED A CAMERA FOR ASSIST
THE VISORS ARE VERY SMALL THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT IS PROBABLY WHAT IS MY LEAST FAVORITE OF ALL ASPECTS OF THIS VEHICLE THERE IS ONLY A SMALL SLICE IT SEEMS TO BE SEEN WHEN LOOKING THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I OFTEN USE
DOES HAVE A BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE
I LOVE THE CAMERA WHILE REVERSING
WE RE A HYUNDAI FAMILY OWN A SANTE FE AND THE & TUSCANS THE FORWARD VISIBILITY IS DEFINITELY BETTER IN THE SANTE FE I VE NOTICED IN THE TUSCANS THE BLIND SPOTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD ARE LARGER DUE TO THE WINDSHIELD
I FEEL THAT THERE IS A TINY BLIND SPOT BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SIDE WINDOWS BUT I LIKE THE LOOK OF THEM
BLIND SPOT ALERT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE
THA ADDITION OF SPOT MIRRORS ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS WOULD HELP ELIMINATE BLIND SPOTS I INSTALLED AFTER MARKET SPOT MIRRORS
THE BACK DOOR WINDOWS ARE AT AN ANGLE SMALLER TOWARDS THE BACK GIVING LESS VISIBILITY SO YOU HAVE A BIGGER BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOTS SEEM TO COVER A LARGER AREA THAN I M USED TO
IT TAKES GETTING USE TO USING THE BACKING UP CAMERA
BLIND SPOT PASSENGER MIRROR
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN PERFORMING SHOULDER CHECKS TO SWITCH LANES IT S HARD TO SEE IF A CAR IS THERE OR NOT
OVERALL I LIKE THIS VEHICLE S CAPABILITY IN THIS DEPARTMENT THE ONLY THING I ADDED IS THE LITTLE ROUND BLIND SPOT MIRRORS TO THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS BUT I DO THIS WITH EVERY VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED
WE DO NOT HAVE ALL WHEEL DRIVE AND SOMETIMES THE TRACTION OF THE VEHICLE IS NOT VERY GOOD REAR VISIBILITY IS BAD WITHOUT THE CAMERA BUT FRONT VISIBILITY IS GREAT
I HATE THE BLIND SPOT WHEN MERGING INTO TRAFFIC
THIS IS A COMPLAINT I HAVE WITH MOST CARS TODAY THE FRAME CREATES TOO LARGE A BLIND SPOT MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN TURNING IN HONOLULU ROADS ARE MORE CONDENSED SO THERE ARE MORE OBSTACLES THAN MOST MAINLAND DRIVING LOCATIONS
SAFETY SYSTEMS ARE SUPER
FRONT COLLISION WARNING COULD USE AN IMPROVEMENT
I LOVE THE REAR WIPER
THERE ARE MORE BLIND SPOTS THAN I THOUGH BUT THE SETUP OF MIRRORS ETC ARE VERY HELPFUL IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES
THERE ARE LARGE BLIND SPOTS IN THE CAR
AS STATED PREVIOUSLY SIDE MIRRORS VISIBILITY ISSUES FOR A SHORT PERSON
THE BLADE SPOT AND JUST THE OVERALL READ VISIBILITY IS POOR
BECAUSE THIS VEHICLE IS A HATCHBACK IT SUFFERS FROM LESS THAN EXCEPTIONAL HEAD TURN VISIBILITY THE MIRRORS MAKE UP FOR THIS VERY WELL BUT IT COULD BE A CONCERN FOR SOME DRIVERS
JUST THAT THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS SO I DON T RELY JUST ON THE BACK UP CAMERA
VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN THE G37 I PREVIOUSLY DROVE
NOT ONLY IS IT A BEAUTIFUL CAR THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE INCREDIBLE
REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY CAN BE SOMEWHAT LIMITING
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE KIND OF TRICKY AT FIRST BUT THE EXTRA MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR REALLY HELPS YOU TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN T SEE FROM PHYSICALLY TURNING AROUND WHEN MERGING LANES FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE ACTUAL
IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THAN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE 2004 HONDA CIVIC EX PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO BACK OUT OF A DRIVEWAY AND LOOK LEFT BEHIND ME AS THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT AND REAR DOOR FRAME BLOCK A LOT OF VISIBILITY
BAD LEFT BLIND SPOT
I FEEL THE TECH PACKAGE SHOULD BE ENABLED EVERY TIME YOU START THE CAR SOMETIMES I FORGET TO TURN IT ON AND WHEN I DO FORGET THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE OF NO USE
SOME TIMES TURNING LEFT AT 4 WAY STOPS HAVE BLIND SPOT WITH SIDE MIRROR
THE SPOILER ACROSS THE REAR WINDOW MAKES VISIBILITY DIFFICULT BLIND SPOT SENSORS WOULD BE A NICE ADDITION
I WISH IT HAD AN AUTO VIEW DIMMING REARVIEW MIRROR AND AUTOMATIC LOWERING PASSENGER MIRROR WHEN PARKING
MY ONLY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE VEHICLE IS THAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE THE REVERSE CAMERA IS A MUST HAVE
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR DUE TO A BAR THAT RUNS ACROSS THE REAR WINDOW IMAGES BEHIND ME APPEAR TO BE SPLIT INTO 2 IMAGES
I AM SHORT MY SEAT IS POSITIONED AT A POINT WHERE WHEN I LOOK TO THE LEFT I LOOK DIRECTLY AT CENTER PILAR I WISH WE HAD A CAMERA ON LEFT SIDE AS WELL I HAVE A HARD TIME JUDGING THE FRONT END DISTANCE FROM OBJECTS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUT BAC
OVER THE SHOULDER VISIBILITY IS GREAT WE HAD A TRAVERSE PRIOR TH THIS VEHICLE AND VISIBILITY WAS HORRIBLE HATED BACKING UP WITH THE TRAVERSE
I LOVE THE NEW DRIVER SAFETY FEATURES SENSORS IN SEATS LIGHTS IN MIRRORS AND FRONT WINDSHIELD ARE A BRILLIANT ADDITION
NOT A LOT OF VISIBILITY OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
I APPRECIATE THE SAFETY FEATURES OF THE VEHICLE I WOULD PREFER THAT THE VIDEO SCREENS BE LOCATED IN THE HEAD RESTS RATHER THAN THE CEILING YOU CANNOT SEE IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN THE VIDEO SCREEN IS DOWN PERHAPS THAT COULD BE A DESIGN CHANG
REALLY LIKE THE LED HEADLIGHTS THEY ARE SO MUCH BRIGHTER AT NIGHT MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY FOR NIGHT DRIVING
VISIBILITY OK BUT NOT AS GOOD AS OLDER GMC S E G 1995 Z71 PICKUP WE OWNED BECAUSE OF SHORTER SIDE WINDOWS WHICH SEEM TO BE THE MODERN STYLE OUR DENALI IS NOT AS EXTREME AS SOME IN THIS REGARD
HEIGHT OF THE TRUNK IS TOO HIGH TO SEE OVER REAR SIDE WINDOWS TOO SMALL AND HAS A LARGE BLIND SPOT
LEFT SIDE VIEW IS POOR NEED SIDE MIRROR WARNING SYSTEM
THE VISIBILITY ON THE LEFT SIDE AND REAR ARE LIMITED
NOT COMFORTABLE WHEN BACKING UP VEHICLE THE SIDE MIRROR ON THE DRIVER SIDE ADJUSTING THE VISIBILITY OF REAR VIEW AND I DONT LIKE THE WAY IT IS
I VE OWNED THE CAR LESS THAN THREE MONTHS AND THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE ALREADY STREAKY
THE HEADLIGHTS COULD BE A BIT BRIGHTER AND THE WIPER BLADES ARE OK AT BEST THE SUN VISORS COULD USE A SLIGHT REDESIGN TO BLOCK THE SUN BETTER
HATCHBACK STYLE HAS BUILT IN ISSUE WITH REAR VISIBILITY SIDE MIRRORS DO FAIR JOB OF MITIGATING THIS BUT STILL A DRAWBACK
THE LANE WATCH AND BACKUP CAMERAS HELP ROUND OUT THE VISIBILITY FOR THE CAR
RIGHT SIDE BLIND SPOT IS VERY HARD TO CHECK FOR 5 4 PERSON SUCH AS MYSELF EVEN WHEN I TURN TO FULLY LOOK BACKWARDS RIGHT SIDE BLIND SPOT CAMERA HELPFUL BUT I WOULD NEVER RELY SOLELY ON THE CAMERA PRIOR TO CHANGING LANES
VISORS NEED EXTENDERS TO BLOCK SUN
SIDE CAMERA IS HELPFUL BUT CAN ALSO BE A DISTRACTION
DIFFICULTY SEEING OUT PASSENGER SIDE WITHOUT USING SIDE CAMERA
THE BLIND SPOT CAMERA UNDER THE RIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS REALLY HELPFUL
VEHICLE TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO ON OCCASION WHEN LOOKING FORWARD TO LEFT AND RIGHT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ONCE YOU DRIVE IT FOR A WHILE YOU GET USED TO LOOKING TWICE I THINK THE IS MUCH IMPROVED FROM THE MODEL REGARDING THIS ISSUE
I BELIEVE THAT THE FRONT AND BACK BLIND SPOTS WHILE DRIVING AND OR PASSING COULD BE IMPROVED WITH A SLIGHT DESIGN IMPROVEMENT
SIDE BLIND SPOTS ARE HARD TO SEE DUE TO HEADREST HEIGHTS
HEADRESTS SOMEWHAT IMPEDE REAR VISION
SEEMS LIKE THE LEFT AND RIGHT FRAME OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD BLOCKS VIEW WHEN LOOKING LEFT OR RIGHT WHEN DRIVING TURNING LIKE A BLIND SPOT
BECAUSE THE VEHICLE IS TALLER THAN MOST OTHERS IT IS HARD TO DETECT A VEHICLE IN YOUR BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE I DON T HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH MY TRUCK BECAUSE I M FORCE TO USE THE MIRRORS BECAUSE THE VISIBILITY IS SO BAD THE JEEP GIVES ME A
NEEDS BETTER HEADLIGHT BULBS
BLIND SPOT DRIVERS SIDE
SIDE BLIND SPOTS ARE REALLY BAD
IT SHOULD HAVE SIDE VIEW BLIND SPOT WARNING ON THIS IT HAS A LARGE BLIND SPOT PEOPLE PASS YOU FROM EITHER SIDE
BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL VEHICLES HAVE LANE ASSIST LIGHTS ON SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
THE HANDLING WHILE DRIVING IS OUTSTANDING HOWEVER VISIBILITY IS LACKING WHEN CHANGING LANES AND PARKING IF IT WASN T FOR THE CAMERA I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REVERSE INTO A PARKING PLACE THE BLIND SPOT AND LANE DEPARTURE WARNING WOULD GREATLY
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS
FRONT CORNER POSTS CREATE DIFFICULT BLIND SPOTS AT TIMES
REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKING ON COMING CARS
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPER IS A LITTLE LOW I HAVE TO STOP FURTHER BACK THAN NORMAL TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE STOP LIGHTS
A PILLAR IS VERY WIDE WHICH REDUCES VISIBILITY AT TIMES B PILLAR IS TOO FAR FORWARD AND MAY REDUCE VISIBILITY WHEN PULLING OUT MAKING A LEFT ONTO A ROADWAY ONLY A PROBLEM WHEN SOMEONE IS IN THE PASSENGER SEAT
POOR VISIBILITY FOR TRAFFIC SIGNAL LIGHTS VISION OF SIGNAL IS OBSTRUCTED BY VEHICLE ROOF FORCING ME TO BEND MY NECK DOWN AND OVER TO ONE SIDE SO I CAN VISUALIZE THE LIGHT STATUS INTERSECTIONS FEATURING A 4 SQUARE LIGHT ARRANGEMENT HELP THIS OT
CHOSE JEEP BECAUSE THE WINDOW VISIBILITY IS GREAT NEW DRIVERS IN OUR HOUSEHOLD SO WE WERE LOOKING FOR LARGER WINDOWS
JUST A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOW YOU HAVE THE SPARE TIRE THERE WHEN BACKING UP A REAR CAMERA WITH A SCREEN ON THE DASH COULD EASILY FIX THE SITUATION COSMETICALLY I LIKE HAVING THE SPARE TIRE VISIBLE ON THE BACK OF THE JEEP SO I WOU
BLIND SPOTS ARE HUGE
THERE IS A BIG BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO SEE OTHER CARS WHEN CHANGING LANES
BACKING UP AND PARALLEL PARKING VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT
NEEDS BACK UP CAMERA AND REAR SENSING SYSTEM
CHANGING LANES CAN BE DIFFICULT BLIND SPOT IS TRICKY
BLIND SPOT INDICATORS COULD BE INCLUDED ON STANDARD MODEL
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE DUAL SUN VISORS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE TO AVOID HAVING TO CHANGE THEM AS THE ROAD CHANGES ASPECT TO THE SUN
SIDE VIEW MIRROR OBSTRUCTS VIEW I AM ALWAYS LOOKING AROUND IT THE CASING IS TOO LARGE THE BACK WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADE SHOULD CLEAR A LARGER SURFACE TO SEE REAR TRAFFIC
NEEDS MUCH BRIGHTER HEADLIGHTS SHOULD GET A BACK UP CAMERA STANDARD
I PUT THE BACK SEATS DOWN WHEN I CAN SO I CAN SEE BETTER LOOKING OUT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
BACK UP CAMERA WOULD BE NICE
OEM STANDARD EQUIPMENT SHOULD HAVE REAR VIEW CAMERA 180DEG + POSSIBLY FOR OFF ROADING OPTIONAL DOWN FRONT VIEW CAMERA
A REAR VIEW CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD OR OPTIONAL WHEN PURCHASING THE HIGH END VERSION IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN REVERSING
REAR VISIBILTY LIMITATIONS HIGHLIGHT THE LACK OF A REAR VIEW BACK UP CAMERA OR PROXIMITY SENSORS
THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT I REALLY HAVE TO CHECK MIRRORS AND OUT THE WINDOWS BEFORE CHANGING LANES
HEADRESTS ON REAR SEATS SPARE TIRE 3RD BRAKE LIGHT AND REAR WIPER ALL CONTRIBUTE TO POOR VISIBILITY OF THE BACK WINDOW
THERE ARE DEFINITE BLIND SPOTS IN THE BACK CORNERS THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A MUST
A AND B PILLAR BLIND SPOTS AND THE REAR WINDOW IS TOO SMALL FOR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING UP
THE LARGE HEAD REST THAT TILT FORWARD ARE THE WORSE  THEY OBSTRUCT VISIBILITY AND CAUSE A BLIND SPOT THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS ALSO CAUSE A BLIND SPOT
BACK UP CAM SHOULD BE AN OPTION IF NOT STANDARD WE PURCHASED THE ALL UPGRADES SAHARA AND WAS TOLD THERE IS NO BACK UP CAM PACKAGE
REAR VISABILITY NOT GOOD
VISIBILITY IS AVERAGE
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE GREAT AND DIDN T FEEL THE NEED TO GET BETTER ONES THE BACK CAMERA HELPS A LOT WITH SEEING HOW FAR YOU ARE FROM SOMETHING
THE VISIBILITY ISN T THAT GOOD WHILE BACKING UP INTO A DRIVEWAY I DON T KNOW IF THIS MEANS THE WINDOWS ARE TOO SMALL OR THE VEHICLE IS TOO HIGH
IT HAS A VERY LARGE BLIND SPOT CREATED BY THE A PILLAR
I THOUGHT THE JEEP LIMITED HAD BLIND SPOT MONITORING MINE DOES NOT WHICH I MISS I THOUGHT THIS WAS STANDARD IN THE LIMITED OR I MAY NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT
COULD HAVE BIGGER REAR VIEW MIRROR OR PARKING CAMERA
FOR THE TYPE OF VEHICLE IT IS VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT
WHEN CHANGING LANES IN A VERY BUSY FREEWAY IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE FROM DRIVER TO PASSENGER REAR SITE DUE TO HEADREST OF REAR LEFT SIDE MUST USE RIGHT REAR VIEW MIRROR FOR ME THERE IS A BLIND SPOT AS DRIVER TURNS HEAD TO SEE OVER SHOULDER TO
SEEMS LIKE HEADLIGHTS AND BRIGHT LIGHTS COULD GIVE BETTER VISIBILITY
BLINDS SPOTS ARE BIGGER THAN IN THE CIVIC I DROVE FOR 13 YEARS
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A REAR VIEW CAMERA WOULD BE HAVE BEEN STANDARD ON ALL KIA VEHICLES
THIS IS MINOR THE LEFT SIDE DRIVER S DOOR MIRROR LIMITS VISIBILITY VIEW WHEN I AM MAKING A LEFT TURN STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF I NEED TO ADJUST MY SEAT DIFFERENTLY TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO PARK WITHOUT THE BACK UP CAMERA
BLIND SPOT IS REAL BAD FOR FRONT WINDSHIELD COLUMNS
I HAVE A SOFT TOP ON MY WRANGLER THE ONLY THING I DISLIKE ABOUT IT SO FAR IS THAT WINTER DRIVING IS DIFFERENT AS MOST OF THE TIME MY REAR VIEW IS NOT CLEAR
SIDE AIRBAGS FOR THE REAR NEED TO BE ADDED ON THE FOUR DOOR MODELS I WOULD IMAGINE FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN TYPICALLY PURCHASE THE FOUR DOOR WRANGLER SALES WOULD SEE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT
ITS HARD TOO SEE WHEN YOUR LOOKING BACK OR TRYING TO GO REVERSE THE BACK SITS TOO HIGH BETWEEN THE BACK SEAT AND BACK WINDOW THIS IS A MAJOR BLIND SPOT
MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE BLIND SPOT OUT RIGHT SIDE OF VEHICLE THAN I HAD REALIZED WHEN TEST DRIVING THE CAR
I VISIBILITY IN MY KIA IS VERY GOOD I CAN SEE EVERYTHING AROUND ME FRONT AND REAR AND WHILE CHANGING LANES
VEHICLE HAS SOME BLIND SPOTS RIGHT AND LEFT SIDE REARWARD
SMALL REAR VIEW WINDOW
SEEMS TO ME THERE IS A BLIND SPOT LOOKING BACK AND TO THE SIDE HAVE TO BECAREFUL ABOUT PASSING OR CHANGING LANES COULD JUST BE ME HOWEVER AND NOT OWNING THE CAR THAT LONG ALL NEW CARS TAKE SOME TIME GETTING USED TO
THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR IS POSITIONED A LITTLE HIGH ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE VEHICLE MAKING IT HARDER TO SEE TRAFFIC ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN ENTERING TRAFFIC AND PARALLEL PARKING
SMALL BACK WINDOW IS HARD TO SEE FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
OVERALL THE CAR HAS GREAT VISIBILITY
I CAN T ADVISE HOW I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS CHANGED BUT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN MY VISION OF CARS PEOPLE ETC HAS BEEN OBSCURED BY THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR AND DOOR WINDOW EDGE THE MIRROR IS LARGE ENOUGH TO CREATE A BLIND SPOT TO PERIPHIA
I HAVE A COMFORTABLE FEELING AS IF I CAN SEE ALMOST EVERYTHING IN A 360 DEGREE CIRCLE THE ONE LOCATION I CANNOT SEE IS COVERED BY THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
WARNING SYSTEM ON SIDE MIRRORS DEFINITELY HELP WITH THE BLIND SPOTS
LARGER THAN EXPECTED BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOTS HANDLES WELL RESPONSIVE TO STEERING AND GAS PEDAL FOR THE SMALL ENGINE THAT IT HAS
WELL DONE GOOD VISIBILITY
THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT VERY GOOD
I HAVE NOT HAD ANY REAL VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING
GREAT VISIBILITY ALL THE WAY AROUND THE VEHICLE
THE A PILLAR IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER S SEAT CAN LIMIT VISIBILITY
I APPRECIATE THE BACK UP CAMERA
IT IS REALLY HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE SIDE WINDOWS WHEN CHANGING LANES DUE TO CAR SEATS THIS IS WHY THE BLIND SPOT BEEPING MECHANISM IS SO AMAZING I FEEL SO SAFE CHANGING LANES WITH THIS FEATURE IN PLACE
UNLESS YOU BACK UP STRAIGHT THE WARNING SYSTEM DOESN T SEEM TO ALERT YOU WHEN YOU ARE CLOSE SO IF YOU ARE BACKING UP AND TURNING RIGHT OR LEFT AS YOU DO WHEN PULLING OUT OF A SPACE THE ALARM WILL NOT SOUND
I LIKE THE THIRD REAR SEAT HAS BIG WINDOWS THE DISLIKE IS WHILE LOOKING THREW THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I COULD SEE THE REAR HEAD RESTING AND IT BLOCKS ABOUT 3 4 OF MY VIEW
THERE ARE DEFINITE BLIND SPOTS I M AWARE OF IT SO I M EXTRA CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES HOWEVER AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK I M COMPLETELY SURPRISED BY A VEHICLE THAT I DIDN T SEE
LANE WARNING ALARM IS GREAT AND LIKE IT BETTER THAN THE RIGHT SIDE CAMERA
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVER SEAT
I WISH FOG LIGHTS WERE STANDARD
THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE SMALLER FROM WHAT I M USED TO IN MY OLD PLYMOUTH GRAND VOYAGER FOR VISIBILITY AND MORE IMPORTANT IS WHEN THE MIDDLE ROW SEATS ARE COLLAPSED UP AGAINST THE FRONT ROW VISIBILITY IS GREATLY REDUCED
I HAVE EXPERIENCED THE MOST BLIND SPOT PROBLEMS WHEN CHANGING LANES AND HAVE TO REPOSITION MY MIRRORS TOO MUCH
I LOVE KNOWING THERE ARE ENOUGH AIR BAGS AND ARE PLACED TO PROTECT EVERYONE IN THE CAR EVEN IF YOU ROLL THE CAR OVER WHICH WOULD BE VERY HARD TO DO IN ANY CASE
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM
SOME DIFFICULTY WITH VISIBILITY WHEN SWITCHING LANES BLIND SPOTS
BAD BLIND SPOTS DIFFICULT TO SEE APPROACHING VEHICLES
HASRD TO SEE BLIND SPOT
REAR VISIBILITY SUFFERS BECAUSE OF STYLING THE POST ON EITHER SIDE AT REAR OBSTRUCTS VIEW
MY KIA HAD A BLIND SPOT TO DRIVER SIDE BECAUSE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THAT SIDE IS TOO WIDE AND I HAVE VERY POOR VISIBIBLITY AND COUPLE OF TIMES I ALMOST CRASH EVEN BEFOE I LOOK BACK COMPLETELY TO CHECK IF OTHERS CAR APPROACHING BUT IS BLIND ANYWAY
THERE IS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT TOWARD THE RIGHT REAR OF THE VEHICLE
WHEN TURNING LEFT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS FRONT WHERE WINDOW MEETS DOOR FRAME
THE FRONT SEAT HEAD RESTRAINTS BLOCK SIDE VISIBILITY AND THE REAR SEAT RESTRAINTS BLOCK VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK ALSO I D LIKE A BIGGER REAE WINDOW
BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES WINDOWS TO SMALL CAR NEEDS TO HAVE MORE HEIGHT
FEELING UNABLE TO SAFELY CHECK BLIND SPOT TO RIGHT REAR IS A SIGNIFICANT FLAW
PRETTY GOOD SIZE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
THE BLIND SPOT IS SCARY
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL FOR THE VEHICLE S SIZE A BLIND SPOT MIRROR WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL
DON T LIKE THE BLIND SPOT
THE BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVER SEAT OUT THE FRONT WINDOW CREATED BY THE CAR FRAME ON LEFT SIDE OF FRONT WINDOW CAN BE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AT TIMES
NEEDS A BRIGHTER FRONT HEADLIGHT I HAD TO SOMETIMES AT NIGHT NEED TO TURN THE FOG LIGHTS ON TO SEE MORE CLEARLY
BACK WINDSHIELD WIPER NEEDS TO BE BIGGER
I CHOSE THIS VEHICLE MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY IT PROVIDED FOR A SPORTY LUXURY TYPE VEHICLE
THE HIGH HEADRESTS IN THE BACK PARTICULARLY IN THE CENTER SEAT MAKE REAR VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT LIMITED
THIS IS MY SECOND QX56 80 I LOVE THIS CAR LOVE THE AUTO START FEATURE AND THE BACKUP CAMERAS I HOPE TO OWN THIS VEHICLE FOR A LONG TIME
FEEL LIKE I HAVE TOTAL VISABILITY WHEN SITTING IN CAR
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT AND THE DRIVING IS ASSURING KNOWING IT HAS SO MANY SAFETY FEATURES
ALTHOUGH THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDES OF THE VEHICLE THE ELECTRONIC AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF VISIBILITY
EXCELLENT OVERALL VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOTS VERY DANGEROUS
BLIND SPOT ASSIST IS ESSENTIAL IN ANY CAR SO I M PLEASED TO HAVE THIS FEATURE
THEIR ARE BLIND SPOTS WHILE DRIVING THEY SAY ALL SUV CARS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM THIS IS MY FIRST SUV THE BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS BLOCK THE BACK WINDOW VIEWING FOR ME
WIDTH OF COLUMNS ARE A HINDERANCE IN VISABILITY
A DIGITAL SPEEDOMETER WOULD REALLY HELP WHEN USING CRUISE CONTROL
BLIND SPOT DETECTION MAKES UP FOR DIFFICULTY SEEING OUT THE SIDE BACK WINDOWS FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
THERE IS OUTSTANDING VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY FEATURES IN THIS VEHICLE WE FEEL VERY SAFE WHEN DRIVING
I WOULD LIKE ONE ADDITIONAL SLOWER WINDSHIELD WIPER SPEED REAR VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN PRIUS BUT STILL NOT GREAT VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES IS NOT GREAT BUT THAT SEEMS TRUE WITH MOST CARS
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE REAR WIPERS
HAVE A BLIND SPOT
THE CT S FRONT VISIBILITY IS COMPROMISED BY THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I FEEL IT IS TOO BIG AND TOO LOW ALSO LOOKING BACK THROUGH THE REAR WINDOWS WHILE BACKING UP IS PRETTY MUCH POINTLESS I RELY ON THE REAR VIEW CAMERAS 100% OF THE TIME
THE SAFETY FEATURES OF THIS VEHICLE ARE TRULY AMAZING AND EASY TO USE
ADD BLIND SPOT MONITORING
I USE THE PARKING ASSIST BLIND ASSIST AND REAR CAMERA FOR VISIBILITY I WOULD NOT NECESSARILY RATE THE ABILITY TO SEE AS HIGH WITHOUT THESE
PASSENGER WINDSHIELD WIPER DOES NOT DO A GREAT JOB
EVERY LEXUS I HAVE EVER OWNED HAS TERRIBLE WINDSHIELD WIPERS THEY STREAK
THE INTERMITTENT WINDSHIELD WIPER SETTINGS SEEMINGLY OFFERS ONE SPEED I M NOT PLEASED WITH THIS
DRIVERS SIDE OUTSIDE MIRROR NEEDS TO BE CAREFULLY ADJUSTED TO SEE CARS IN ADJACENT LANE TAKES MORE TRIAL AND ERROR THAN OTHER CARS I HAVE OWNED ALSO LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM SHOULD BEEP LIKE MERCEDES & OTHER CARS DO WHEN A CAR IS IN ADJACEN
REAR WIPER AREA IS SMALL
HAVING THE DUAL SUN VISORS WOULD BE NICE THESE ARE KIND OF SMALL
I FEEL VERY SAFE DRIVING MY GX 460 HOWEVER GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE I WOULD HAVE LIKED THE OPTION TO EITHER PURCHASE THE SIDE VIEW CAMERA SYSTEMS OR THIS OPTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE IN THE ALL GX 460 MODEL LINES ALSO THE ADDITI
REAR VISIBILITY AND REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER COVERAGE COULD BE IMPROVED
I WOULD LIKE THE WARNING SYSTEM THAT STOPS THE CAR BASED ON AN ABJECT IN THE ROAD AHEAD
I CERTAINLY FEEL SAFER DRIVING A MODERN LEXUS LOTS OF THOUGHT AND TESTING FOR SAFETY
LANE CHANGING INDICATOR AND BACKUP WARNING SYSTEM ARE WONDERFUL
AUTO WINDSHIELD WIPERS VARY SPEED TOO MUCH TOO SOON
BACK UP CAMERA IS EXCELLENT
DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT IS EXCESSIVE
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE RATHER LARGE AND OBSTRUCT THE VIEW OUTWARD VISIBILITY LOOKING BACK IS EXCELLENT BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS EXCELLENT
REAR VISIBLIITY WOULD BE POOR IF IT DIDN T HAVE THE CAMERA
I REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE MY VISIBILITY IS RESTRICTED WHEN TRYING TO TURN RIGHT THE COLUMNS THAT SUPPORT THE ROOF SEEM TO BE TOO WIDE AND RESTRICT MY VISION WHEN TURNING THIS IS PROBABLY BECAUSE THE AIR BAGS ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THE COLUMN ITSELF
THE VISIBILITY IS GOOD FOR THE SIZE OF VEHICLE IT IS JUST SOMETHING I NEED TO GET USED TO
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BLIND SPOT WARNING DEVICE WHEN CHANGING LANES
I LIKE THE ABLITY TO USE THE BLIND SPOT SENSORS I LIKE THAT I CAN SEE OUT OVER THE CAR HOOD
I SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE BLOCKING A CRITICAL LINE OF SIGHT
I REALLY LOVE THIS CAR EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY GET FRUSTRATED WITH BLUETOOTH NOT UNDERSTANDING COMMAND THE ONLY REASON I DID NOT RATE THE WIPERS 10 IS BECAUSE THE FEW TIMES I HAVE USED THEM SO FAR IS A LITTLE CONFUSING WITH SLOW AND FAST SPEEDS GETTI
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHICH FORCES ME TO RELY ON BSM ON MIRRORS
SIDE VISIBILITY IS ENHANCED BY SIDE MIRRORS AND CAMERAS BUT NOT SO GOOD WHEN DRIVER IS TURNING HEAD TO CHECK AROUND VEHICLE
GREAT VISIBILITY OVERALL MUCH BETTER THAN OUR OLD AUDI Q7 WISH THE LX HAD BLIND SPOT WARNING
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR
THE SIDE MIRROR WARNING LIGHTS ARE HELPFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES BUT THE VEHICLE HAS SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS
I WOULD LIKE THE CAR TO HAVE RAIN SENSING WIPERS
WAS LED TO BELIEVE THIS MODEL WOULD HAVE ALL OF THE NEW SAFETY FEATURES SUCH AS LANE DEPARTURE ALERT AND PRE COLLISION SAFETY FUNCTIONS WHICH IT DID NOT WHEN DELIVERED
WHEN MERGING INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC AND HAVE TO LOOK OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER TO MERGE INTO TRAFFIC I CANNOT SEE DOWN THE ROAD FOR ONCOMING CARS VARY FAR ALSO WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE AND LOOKING OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER I CANNOT SEE ONCOMI
LED HEADLIGHTS PROVIDE VERY WIDE DISPERSION THUS GREATLY IMPROVED NIGHT VISION THERE ARE REALLY NO BLIND SPOTS OR HARD TO ADJUST TO REAR VISIBILITY ISSUES
VERY DIFFICULT TO SIDE THE BACK AND SIDES BLIND SPOTS TOO BIG
HAS A BAD BLIND SPOT BUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM MAKES THAT SOOOOO MUCH EASIER
I VE SEEN MUCH BETTER CAMERA VIEWS WHILE BACKING IT IS HARD TO PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE AS TO HOW CLOSE THE SIDES ARE AND THEIR IS NO INDICATOR AS TO YOUR AS YOU TURN
REAR GLASS VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT
THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR HELPS BUT THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS
EXCEPTIONAL OUTSIDE OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AUTO DIMMING ISSUE RELATED TO THE CURVED SHAPE LIKE THE DESIGN CAN BE VERY DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING AT NIGHT
BLIND SPOT IS HUGE MUST TOTALLY RELY ON ELECTRONIC BSM WHICH WORKS WELL
NEED THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM IN RX S OTHERWISE THE VISIBILITY IS QUITE LIMITED WOULD ALSO LIKE A FRONT CAMERA TO SEE OBSTACLES BELOW DRIVER S FIELD OF VISION IE LOW WALLS CHILDREN S TOYS ETC THE PARK ASSIST HELPS TO A LARGE EXTENT
SUN VISORS TOO SMALL TO BLOCK THE SUN IN SOME CASES NEARBY VEHICLE WRING LIGHTS ON THE MIRRORS ARE GREAT I WOULD LIKE THE WORDS SHOWN ON THE NAV SYSTEM TO BE LARGER THEY ARE SOMETIMES HARD TO READ
THE MKX NEEDS BIGGER MIRRORS WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR IT WOULD BE A BIGGER ISSUE THAN IT IS THE MIRRORS ON THE MKC ARE BIGGER THAT THE MKX THAT IS AN ISSUE
THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS TERRIFIC DON T KNOW WHAT I DID WITHOUT IT
I LIVE IN A HARSH WINTER CLIMATE SNOW BUILDS UP ON THE BACK OF THE VEHICLE SO THAT THE BACK UP AIDS AND REAR CAMERA DON T HELP AT ALL I THINK I VE SACRIFICED THESE FEATURES FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE CAR
SAFETY DRIVING
SEEMS TO HAVE MORE OF A BLIND SPOT BUT THE ELECTRONICS KEEP ME AWARE
WIPERS DON T WASH WELL TOWARD TOP OF WINDOW VISIBILITY LIMIT CAUSES A LOT OF STREAKING
I REALLY LIKE THE VISIBILITY IN THE FRONT I M VERY SHORT AND I HAVE NO PROBLEM SEEING
GREAT VISION FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT AND BEST HEADLIGHT VISION IN ANY VEHICLE I HAVE EVER BEEN IN
VISIBILITY IS GOOD WE FEEL SAFE IN THE VEHICLE
WOULD LIKE THE CONVEX MIRROR ASPECT I HAD IN PREVIOUS VEHICLES
GREAT VISIBILITY IS CRITICAL TO ME AND THE NAVIGATOR CAN T BE BEAT IN THIS FEATURE
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT LIGHT IN THE SIDE MIRRORS
IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE REAR RIGHT REAR HAS BIG BLIND SPOT IF THERE WAS NOT REAR VIEW CAMERA IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE REAR MY PREVIOUS CAR WAS IS 350 C AND IT HAD REALLY BAD REAR VIEW PROBLEM SPECIALLY WITH THE HEAD RESTS UP IN THE
THE REAR QUARTER PANEL VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT BUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS EXCELLENT
LOVE THE WARNING SYSTEM ON MY SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
I WANT MANUFACTORER TO PUT THE LITTLE CIRCULAR MIRROR INSIDE THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS TO ELIMINATE THE BLIND SPOT
WE FEEL VERY SECURE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR AND BACKUP CAMERA ARE USEFUL AND HELPFUL
DRIVER S VISIBILITY THROUGH REAR GLASS IS LESS THAN DESIRED
SOME BLIND SPOT ISSUES I DON T RELY ENTIRELY ON THE ELECTRONIC BLIND SPOT INDICATORS
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT ALL AROUND
THE ALERT SYSTEM AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING MAKES ME A SAFER DRIVER
GOOD VISIBILITY AND FUN TO DRIVE
LOVE THE AUTOMATED LANE VISIBILITY AIDS
POOR VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WIND WHEN USING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING BACK TO CHANGE LANES
VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD OVERALL
VERY STURDY VEHICLE I WAS RECENTLY IN A SMALL ACCIDENT AND RECEIVED VERY MINOR DAMAGE ABS SYSTEM WAS VERY EFFECTIVE
I HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE VEHICLE S EXECUTION FOR SAFETY AND VISIBILITY
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHT GREAT IDEA
SLIGHT OBSTRUCTION IN REAR PASSENGER SIDE WHEN LOOKING BACK PRIOR TO CHANGING LANES HOWEVER THE LIGHT WARNING ON MIRRORS AND BEING COGNIZANT OF SMALL BLIND SPOT DOES NOT CAUSE AN ISSUE
BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHT SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL VEHICLES
BACK UP CAMERA REALLY HELPS
THE REAR WINDOW NEEDS WIPER BLADES
FORWARD AND SIDE VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED NOT AS GOOD AS MY PREVIOUS CAR
THE CAR IS REALLY DEPENDENT ON THE BRIGHTS AT NIGHT VERY SMALL VISIBLE AREA WITHOUT THE BRIGHTS
THE SIDE VISIBILITY IS SOMETHING I AM ADJUSTING TO PERHAPS BECAUSE I AM TALL I FIND THE SPACE BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK SEAT OBSTRUCTS MY VIEW WHEN I AM TRYING TO PASS UNLESS I MAKE AN EXTREME TURN OF MY BODY
OVERALL VISIBILITY IS GREAT BLIND SPOT MONITORING REALLY HELPS
I LIKE LANE CHANGE WARNING IN THE SIDE MIRRORS
BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY IMPORTANT AND USEFUL GIVEN THE LIMITED REAR SIDE AND REAR VISIBILITY SAME FOR LANE CHANGE WARNING LIGHT AND AUDIO ON SIDE MIRRORS FOR BLIND SPOT MONITORING
REAR VIEW CAMERA SHOULD BE INCLUDED FROM BASE MODEL
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SHOULD EXTEND TO THE TOP RIGHT OF THE WINDSHIELD AS RAIN DIRT IMPAIRS THE VIEW OF THE PASSENGER
BLIND SPOT BEHIND FRONT WINDOW POSTS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE FRONT
COULD USE REAR WIPER AND SMALLER B COLUMNS FRONT VISIBILITY IS PHENOMENAL
THE REAR WINDOW IS A LITTLE LOW DOWN MEANING THAT IT WOULD BE NICE IF IT EXTENDER FURTHER UP THE REAR OF THE VEHICLE THE FRAME ON EITHER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD CAN BLOCK VISION FROM A CERTAIN ANGLE BUT THE VEHICLE SAFETY FEATURES HELP COMBAT TH
I LOVE THAT THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS CLEAR SO MUCH OF THE FRONT WINDOW
FRONT PASSENGER HEADREST CAUSES BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOT INDICATORS IN SIDE MIRRORS ARE QUITE HELPFUL
THE BLIND SPOT IS EXAGGERATED BY THE SHAPE OF THE SIDE WINDOWS I ALWAYS FEEL AS IF I CAN T SEE EVERYTHING ON MY SIDES
THE 360 DEGREE CAMERA FEATURE IS GREAT
MY CAR CAME WITH NO REAR CAMERA THEY SAID IT WAS OPTIONAL I ASK THE DEALERSHIP CAN I PAY TO HAVE ONE INSTALL THEY TOLD IT CAN NOT BE DONE I ALWAYS THOUGHT IF SOMETHING IS OPTIONAL IT COULD BE ADDED LATER THAT WHAT I THOUGHT
REAR CENTER HEADREST DOES NOT COLLAPSE AND OBSCURES REAR VIEW
POOR VISIBILITY TO SIDE REAR WHEN BACKING UP REAR MOST SIDE WINDOWS NOT VISIBLE FROM DRIVER S SEAT
I M USED TO IT NOW BUT THE REAR AND BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS A BIT WORSE THAN OTHER VEHICLES NOT A HUGE DEAL
IT HAS GREAT OVERALL VISIBILITY IT S FANTASTIC FROM THE FRONT WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
THERE IS NO STANDARD COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM UNLESS YOU HAVE ENGAGED THE OPTIONAL CRUSE CONTROL
SAFE TO DRIVE GOOD VISIBILITY
REAR VIEW MIRROR VISIBILITY AREA IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH AND ALSO DOES NOT FLIP DURING CAR WASH DRIVE THROUGH
THE SHAPE OF THE REAR OF THE CAR LIMIT SIGHT LINES FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT WHEN LOOKING FOR CARS APPROACHING FROM THE REAR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE THERE IS NO WARNING DEVICE ON THIS CAR TO ALERT ME TO PEOPLE IN MY BLIND SPOT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT SOMETH
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE GETTING BETTER MY GIRLFRIEND OWNS A SOUL WHICH HAS MUCH LARGER BLIND SPOTS BUT I STILL HAVE SOME VISIBILITY ISSUES WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE HIGH SAFETY RATING OF THIS CAR WAS IMPORTANT TO OUR DECISION TO BUY
THE ABILITY TO LOOK OUR REAR VIEW IS DIFFICULT EVEN WITH REAR VIEW MIRROR I DEPEND MORE ON SIDE MIRRORS AND ACTUALLY TURNING MY HEAD TO DOUBLE CHECK WHILE DRIVING FORWARD NOT BACKWARD REAR CAMERA AND SYSTEM WORK GREAT BUT ONCE IT GETS DIRTY A
HEADLIGHTS COULD BE STRONGER DIFFICULT TO TELL IF HEADLIGHT ARE ON OR IF JUST THE LED LIGHTS AT TIMES
THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL AND THIS GIVES GREAT STYLING BUT DOES HAMPER VISIBILITY A LITTLE THE REAR WIPER IS MINUTE WHICH DOESNT HELP IN REALLY WET WEATHER
WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED ALMOST DIDN T BUY IT THAT BLIND SPOT WARNING WAS NOT AVAILABLE LIKE MY RX350
THE BLIND SPOT IS TOO LARGE
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE A LITTLE SMALL SO IT S HARD TO SEE ANY CARS BUT THERE S ALSO QUITE A FEW BLINDS SPOTS IN THE VEHICLE EVEN WHEN I TURN MY HEAD IT S STILL DIFFICULT TO SEE ALSO THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL ENOUGH AS IS AND IT DOESN T HELP T
I M A SHORT PERSON AND HAVE NO DIFFICULTY WITH THE VISIBILITY
DO NOT LIKE THE BACKUP CAMERA IT CONSTANTLY CHIMES WHEN BACKING UP WHICH ISN T NECESSARY ALSO THE CAMERA ISN T HELPFUL AS IT DOESN T PROPERLY ASSIST
BLIND SPOTS ARE A LITTLE LARGE FOR SUCH A SMALL CAR DRIVES GREAT AND FEELS VERY WELL BUILT
VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED OVERALL
REAR WINDOW IS TOO SMALL BUT I RELY ON THE BACK UP CAMERA WHEN IN REVERSE MODE
LOVE THE 360 CAMERA VIEW EXTRA SAFETY FEATURE
THERE IS A FAIRLY LARGE BLIND SPOT LOOKING ACROSS TOWARD THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR
SAFETY FEATURES ARE SUPERB AND GIVES ME A SENSE OF COMFORT
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SOUND BEEPING SYSTEM BACK UP SAFETY FEATURE
HARD TO SEE TO CHANGE LANES AND TO BACK UP BC THERE ARE NO BACK UP SENSORS ONLY THE CAMERA
WISH DRIVER BLIND SIDE ALERT WAS AN ADD ON BY ITSELF
SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL FOR THIS SIZE VEHICLE
MOVING BACK UP LINES ON DISPLAY HELP PARALLEL PARKING MORE THAN AUDIBLE SENSORS AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN SELF PARKING
I HAVE NOT MASTERED USING MY REAR VIEW CAMERA I STILL USE MU SIDE MIRRORS
FOR A VEHICLE OF THIS SIZE THE OVERALL VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT AND COUPLED WITH THE OPTIONAL BLIND SPOT DETECTION THE ABILITY TO DRIVE THE VEHICLE SAFELY AND MANEUVER THE VEHICLE BETWEEN LANES IS EXCELLENT
REAR SIDE VISIBILITY IS POOR
THE VEHICLE SENSORS ARE HELPING WHEN I CAN T SEE OTHER VEHICLES BECAUSE OF THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE BLINDSPOT
I REALLY LIKE THE SAFETY OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND FEATURES I WISH I HAD A FRONT CAMERA TO SEE THE FRONT EDGE OF BUMPERS WHEN PULLING INTO GARAGE ETC I LOVE AND USE MY BACKUP CAMERA AND ACTUALLY USE IT DAILY TO BACK INTO OUR ONE CAR GARAGE WO
VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT WHEN BACKING UP ALTHOUGH IT HAS A BACKUP CAMERA
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE OUTSTANDING I FREQUENTLY DRIVE ON NARROW MOUNTAIN ROADS AND THE ADAPTIVE HEADLIGHTS GIVE ME EXCELLENT NIGHTTIME VISIBILITY THE AUTO DIMMING FEATURE THAT SWITCHES FROM BRIGHT TO DIM WHEN A VEHICLE APPROACHES IS EXCELLENT
I LEASE MERCEDES FOR THE SAFETY FEATURES I WAS IN A HIGHWAY ACCIDENT IN A PREVIOUS ML AND NO ONE WAS INJURED I FEEL VERY SAFE IN A MERCEDES
GREAT XENON HEADLIGHTS
THE LANE CHANGING WARNING AND AUTOMATIC SPEED REDUCTION SEEMS LIKE OVERKILL
THE FEELING OF SAFETY
I LIKE THE LANE CHANGE FEATURE NO WORRY ABOUT BLIND SPOTS
I DO FIND THAT WHEN I AM CHANGING LANES THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE SIDES IS NOT GREAT AND FIND MYSELF RELYING ON THE CAR TO ALERT ME IF THERE IS SOMEONE IN THE OTHER LANE AS A CONFIRMATION I FEEL INCREDIBLY SAFE IN THE CAR WHICH IS THE MAIN REASON
I THINK THE VEHICLE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT AND WHAT IS EXPECTED FOR A COUPE AND THE ELECTRONIC SAFETY ITEMS IMPROVE THINGS LIKE CHANGING LANE BUT STILL A BIT HARD FOR VISIBILITY ALSO I DON T DRIVE THE CAR VERY MUCH SO MAYBE I JUST DON T HAVE EN
VISIBILITY FROM VEHICLE SIDE AND BACK IS DIMINISHED FROM S550 IT IS TROUBLESOME
GLAD THE CAR HAS CAMERA WHEN REVERSING
THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE VERY HELPFUL
I FEEL THERE ARE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS WITH THIS CAR
HORRIFIC BLIND SPOT SENSORS SHOULD BE STANDARD AND NOT OPTIONAL
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE AT THE MID CABIN PILLAR WHICH RESTRICTS VISIBILITY TO THE RIGHT AT INTERSECTIONS ESPECIALLY IF THE ROAD TO THE RIGHT INTERSECTS AT A LESS THAN 90 DEGREE ANGLE
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURES ARE VERY GOOD
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME MINOR INCIDENTS WITH THE REAR CAMERA AND DOOR LOCKS THE REAR VIEW CAMERA DIDN T WORK WHEN I MUTED THE AUDIO OR THE LOCKS
BLINDS SPOTS WHEN LOOKING TO SIDES AND BACK UP CAMERA DOES NOT PROVIDE GOOD GUIDANESCE
COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IS SENSITIVE TO LARGE TRUCKS IN ADJACENT LANE BUT AHEAD OF YOU ON A CURVE
VISIBILITY FROM THE BACK SEAT IS VERY RESTRICTED BY THE FRONT SEAT HEADREST EVEN IN A FULL DOWN POSITION
VISIBILITY GREATLY IMPROVES WITH THE TOP DOWN
IT IS A CONVERTIBLIE I EXPECT BLIND SPOTS
THE BLIND SPOT ASSIST IS EXCEPTIONAL BOTH THE VISIBLE INDICATIONS AND AUDIBLE WARNINGS A GREAT SYSTEM
LACK OF BACKUP CAMERA IS ONLY SHORTCOMING
MERCEDES HAS DONE SO MUCH TO INSURE SAFETY AND VISIBILITY THIS IS MY 3RD MERCEDES BENZ E CLASS I CAN SEE THE PROGRESS MERCEDES HAS MADE WITH EACH NEW E I OWN
ON THE CONVERTIBLE I FIND THE CENTER SCREEN TO BE AN OBSTRUCTION FROM SEEING OUT OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IT WOULD BE NICE FOR THE SCREEN TO GO DOWN COMPLETELY
CENTER PILLAR LIMITS SIDE VISIBILITY
INTERMITTENT WINDSHIELD WIPER SYSTEM NOT INTUITIVE CONTINUALLY NEED TO MANUALLY ADJUST WIPERS ARE NOISY
GOOD VISIBILITY REAR CAMERA HELPS WITH BACKING UP
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS THE VISIBILITY OF CARS COMING FROM THE RIGHT
SIDEBAND REAR VISIBILITY ARE POOR BACKUP CAMERA IS ESSENTIAL IM GETTING USED TO THE LANE CHANGE ASSIST BUT DON T FULLY TRUST IT AND WISH I COULD SEE BETTER WITH THE SIDE MIRRORS
I REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT PROTECTION DEVICES
REAR CAMERA IS GREAT
BAR BETWEEN FRONT AND BACK DOORS IS TOO WIDE CREATES A MAJOR BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER
CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE HAD TO TAKE OUT THE WIND SCREEN BETWEEN THE TWO REAR HEADRESTS SO I COULD SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOW WITH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
DON T SEE A LOT THRU THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT WHICH MAKES IT EASIER TO DRIVE MY MINI
THE PILLARS PARTICULARLY THE B PILLARS ARE HUGE AND WITHOUT THE ELECTRONIC ASSIST WOULD MAKE THE CAR NEARLY UNDRIVABLE DUE TO A LACK OF REAR VISIBILITY
THE FORWARD VISIBILITY FEELS LIKE IT CUTS OFF A PORTION FROM THE TOP IF USING A VISOR IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS
FEELS VERY SAFETY
THE HEADRESTS BLOCK THE REAR VIEW
BEING ABLE TO CHECK THE LEFT BLIND SPOT BEFORE CHANGING LANES COULD BE IMPROVED
TERRIBLE BLIND SPOTS LOOKING BACK WHEN TRYING TO BACK OUT OF A PARKING SPACE
BECAUSE IT IS A CONVERTIBLE WHEN TOP UP IS WHEN VISIBILITY DURING LANE CHANGES IS LIMITED
THE HANDLING IS SECOND TO NONE IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE MANEUVER YOU DON T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT RECOVERING FROM THE MANEUVER MANY ACCIDENTS ARE CAUSED BY THE INITIAL AVOIDANCE MANEUVER FOLLOWED BY AN INABILITY TO RECOVER CONTROL
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO BACK UP OUT OF A PARKING SPACE AND SEE ONCOMING TRAFFIC UNLESS TOP IS DOWN A BACK UP CAMERA IS BADLY NEEDED
EXTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRRORS COULD STAND TO BE A LITTLE BIGGER
SINCE I HAVE A LONG TORSO VISIBILITY WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME IF THE SEATS COULD LOWER EVEN MORE
RATHER LARGE BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER S SIDE TOWARDS THE REAR
BLINDSPOT IS TERRIBLE
VEHICLE COME WITH SIDE HEADLIGHTS THAT ENGAGE WHEN TAKING TIGHT CORNERS THESE ARE EXCEPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS TO VISIBILITY IN URBAN SITUATIONS AS THEY ALLOW YOU TO SEE INTO A TURN BEFORE MAKING IT
BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY WITH TOP UP IS VERY UNACCEPTABLE BLIND SPOT RECOGNITION SYSTEM SHOULD BE INCLUDED WITH CONVERTIBLES
I LOVE THAT IT HAS THE SIDE SUN VISOR AS WELL AS THE FRONT FACING ONES
REAR VIEW IS TRICKY
REAR AND FORWARD BLIND SPOTS ARE TOUGH
THE FOG LIGHTS ARE GREAT FOR FOG WE ALSO USE THEM AT NIGHT FOR FURTHER VISIBILITY
AVERAGE FEELING OF SAFETY
THE REAR HEAD RESTRAINTS BLOCK VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REAR I KEEP THE MIDDLE FOLDED DOWN BUT I HAVE PASSENGERS IN THE REAR ON A DAILY BASIS SO THE LEFT AND RIGHT NEED TO REMAIN UP
THE BACK SEAT HEADREST CAN INTERFERE WITH REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY BUT THE ABILITY TO LOWER THEM AND LAY THEY FLATTER IS A TRUE BENEFIT
THE PANORAMIC SUNROOF WHETHER REAL OR PERCEIVED SEEMS TO OPEN UP THE VIEW OF SURROUNDING TRAFFIC
REAR VIEW MIRROR TOOK SOME GETTING USED TO AT FIRST BUT IS OKAY NOW
THERE IS A SMALL GAP BETWEEN SIDE SUN VISOR AND FRONT VISOR WHEN BOTH ARE DOWN AND OF COURSE THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THE SUN IS SHINING MAYBE SIDE VISOR COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER
THE REAR WIPER DOESN T WIPE AS MUCH OF THE REAR WINDOW AS I WOULD LIKE BUT OVERALL THIS IS ALL QUITE GOOD
WIPER BLADES DON T SEEM TO HUG THE WINDSHIELD AS THEY SHOULD
THE ONLY REASON THE FORWARD VISIBILITY GETS AN 8 IS I AM TALL AND SOMETIMES THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS IN A BAD SPOT FOR SEEING CROSSING TRAFFIC SO I NEED TO DUCK TO SEE
I FIND THE OUTWARD VISIBILITY JUST A BIT RESTRICTED
FORWARD VISIBILITY IS PERFECTLY FINE FOR NORMAL DRIVING HOWEVER WITH LONG ISH HOOD IT IS SLIGHTLY HARDER WHEN PARKING
BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS VERY USEFUL
I LOVE THE LANE CHANGE WARNINGS
REAR VISIBILITY IS QUITE LIMITED THIS IS A FAILURE OF NEARLY ALL COMPACT SUVS I DON T LIKE THE FACT THAT SOME DRIVING SAFETY FEATURES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE BY BUYING THE MOST EXPENSIVE MODELS
GREAT SAFETY SCORES THIS IS WHY WE BOUGHT IT
ITS REALLY HARD TO SEE A CAR IN THE BLIND SPOT THE BACK PART AROUND THE LITTLE BACK SIDE WINDOW IS REALLY THICK AND HARD TO JUST GLANCE AROUND ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT I ALWAYS HAVE TO CHECK NUMEROUS TIMES BEFORE ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING CAUSE I JU
THE BLIND SPOT AND BACKING UP SENSORS MAKE THE VEHICLE WORK IT WOULD BE NICE TO BE ABLE TO USE THE REAR CAMERA WHEN NOT IN REVERSE COMING FROM A TRUCK I HAVE TO GET USED TO THE FORWARD BLIND SPOTS OF A PASSENGER CAR AGAIN
IT MIGHT JUST BE MY BODY SIZE AND HEIGHT 230LB AND 5 10 BUT THE FRONT AND SIDE PILLARS SEEM TO CREATE BLIND SPOTS IN MY PREFERRED DRIVING POSITION OR MAYBE I M TOO USED TO MY LAST CAR A SUBARU IMPREZA WAGON I JUST HAVE TO MOVE MY HEA
I REALLY DON T LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IT GOES OFF WHEN IT DOESN T NEED TO AND DOESN T GO OFF WHEN IT DOES NEED TO YOU D BE MUCH BETTER OFF TO SET THE MIRRORS CORRECTLY AND TURN YOUR HEAD THE OLD FASHIONED WAY FOR THE MOST PART I FIND I
BACKUP CAMERA AND MIRRORS MAKE UP FOR THE HEIGHT OF THE REAR GLASS WORKS VERY EFFECTIVELY AS A WHOLE SYSTEM
LIGHTING FROM HEADLIGHTS IS OUTSTANDING BUT PARADOXICALLY CAN BE A BIT UNSETTLING THE BI XENON HEADLIGHTS HAVE A VERY SHARP OUTLINE WHAT S LIT IS WELL LIT WHAT IS NOT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THIS CAN CREATE A SENSE OF UNEASE ON HIGHWAYS BECAUSE T
PASSENGER SIDE VISIBILITY IS POOR BUT BLIND SPOT MONITORING COMPENSATES DOOR FRAME AND PASSENGER HEAD REST INTERFERE WITH VISIBILITY
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURE IS OUTSTANDING  THIS IS A WELL DESIGNED SYSTEM AND DEFINITELY REDUCES THE POSSIBILITY OF ACCIDENTS
I NOTICED WHEN I FIRST DROVE THE CAR WHEN CHANGING LANES THERE IS A SMALL BLIND SPOT IN THE BACK WHERE THE SIDE OF THE CARE MEETS THE BACK WINDOW WHEN I LOOKED IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR YOU CAN NOT SEE IF A CAR IS RIGHT AT THAT SPOT I NOW TURN MY
WITH THE TOP UP IT IS HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES IN EITHER DIRECTION THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE MARGINAL AND THE CLOSED TOP RESULTS IN A BLIND SPOT TO THE BACK RIGHT FOR THE DRIVER
MY BIGGEST ISSUE WITH VISIBILITY IS THERE THERE ARE SOME MAJOR BLIND SPOTS IN THE CAR THAT WILL HIDE AN ENTIRE VEHICLE WHEN IT ISN T QUITE WITHIN THE SIDE SENSORS ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WHEN I SIT DOWN IN THE DRIVER S SEAT EVEN WITH IT RAISED UP
I AM NOT A TALL PERSON AND SOMETIMES THE VISIBILITY WHILE TURNING RIGHT OR LEFT IS BLOCKED BY THE LOCATION OF THE FRONT WINDOW POSTS IT IS ALSO SOMETIME DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE THE FRONT RIGHT PORTION OF THE CAR IS IN REFERENCE TO ANOTHER CAR WHI
PULL DOWN OF VISOR AS WELL AS RIGHT EXTENDER SHOULD BE ADDED ALSO WHEN IT IS EXTENDED AND YOU PUSH IT UP THE EXTENSION HITS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THE PRESSURE OF THE WIPERS WAS NOT GREAT FROM START THEY STREAKED
TRULY LOVE THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING
NICE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS AND BLIND SPOT WARNING BEEP WHEN TURN SIGNAL IS ON ARE WONDERFUL
I USED TO DRIVE A MAZDA 3 AND I FELT I HAD LESS BLIND SPOTS IN THAT MODEL BUT I WILL SAY THE BLIND SPOT SENSORS AND BACK UP CAMERA ARE A HUGE HELPS WITH THIS THE SUN VISORS IN THIS CAR ARE TOO SMALL AND BARELY BLOCK ANY SUNLIGHT FOR ME
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND THE REAR WARNING YOU REALLY GOT IT RIGHT ON THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING EFFECTIVE NOT INTRUSIVE OR JARRING
I ADDED CONVEX MIRRORS TO SEE PASSING CARS OR CARS TO MY IMMEDIATE RIGHT
I THINK MERCEDES IS FALLING BEHIND LESSER MANUFACTURERS IN PROVIDING STANDARD SAFETY FEATURES ON THEIR CARS THE AUTO STOPPING FEATURE LANE DEPARTURE BLIND SPOT WARNING ETC SHOULD BE STANDARD BY THE WAS SO SHOULD ALL HISTRIONIC FEATURES I CO
THE WEAK HORN IS THE ONLY SAFETY FEATURE THAT SLIGHTLY DETRACTS FROM THE FEELING OF SAFETY WHILE DRIVING THE VEHICLE I WONDER IF OTHER DRIVERS WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR IT IF I NEED TO USE IT
THE LANE CHANGING WARNING SYSTEM COMPENSATES FOR ANY BLIND SPOTS
THE MOE TIRES ARE THE BIGGEST DRAWBACK IN TERMS OF SAFETY
A BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVER S SIDE LOOKING TO THE RIGHT
BLIND SPOTS ARE BIGGER THAN WITH PREVIOUS BENZ
THE BLIND SPOT FEATURE IS AN EXCELLENT SAFETY OPTION
I D LIKE TO HAVE A FRONT CAMERA FOR PARKING PURPOSES SIMILAR TO THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
WHEN WE BOUGHT THE CAR WE THOUGHT IT HAD FOG LIGHTS THAT WAS UNEXCEPTABLE
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR CAN BE SMALLER
SHOULD HAVE A LIGHT TO TELL WHEN IF THERE IS A CAR NEXT TO YOU IN THE BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY IS GOOD
I PURCHASED THIS CAR OVER ANOTHER DUE TO GOOD VISIBILITY FEEL THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN DRIVING AS MUCH AS I DO
CAR FEELS SOLID WHEN DRIVING IT GOOD FEELING A SAFETY WISH NISSAN WOULD MAKE STANDARD AT A MINIMUM THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEM IN ALL IT S VEHICLES REAR BACK UP CAMERA WAS A GOOD START
SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD ROTATE 10 RO 15 MORE DEGREES OUTWARDS THE CAR HAS ANNOYING BLIND SPOT WHEN THERE IS ANOTHER CAR ABOUT 5 FEED BEHIND IT IN THE NEXT LANE
BLIND SPOT VISION IS VIRTUALLY NON EXISTENT
I LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA
IT KIND OF BOTHERS ME THAT I CANNOT SEE THE END OF THE TRUNK WHEN I AM BACKING UP THANK GOODNESS I PURCHASED AN ALTIMA WITH BACKUP CAMERA OTHERWISE THERE WOULD BE A HUGE PROBLEM
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT IN REAR PASSENGER SIDE WHEN I TURN MY HEAD TO SEE IF A CAR IS NEARBY WHEN CHANGING LANES
SPOT MIRRORS AS STANDARD FEATURE BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY DRIVERS SIDE
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP IN THIS VEHICLE
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BUILD IN BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
ALL NEW CARS SUCK NOT JUST THIS NISSAN DESIGN OF 20 YEARS AGO HAD MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY
WITH THE BACK SEAT HEAD REST IT LIMITS YOUR VIEW FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND THE SIDE MIRRORS WOULD VE BEEN A LOT BETTER IF THEY WERE HEATED
WINDSHIELD CONSTRUCTION MAKES LEFT TURN VISIBILITY LIMITED
BLIND SPOT ALERT WOULD BE NICE MAYBE IF IT HAD THE AUTO HEAD ON AUTO STOP
THE CAR IS GREAT I LOVE THE WAY THE WINDSHIELD IS ANGLED IT MAKE VISIBILITY SO CLEAR
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ABSOLUTELY CRAP I OWNED A MAZDA 3 AND THOSE HEADLIGHTS WERE FAR SUPERIOR THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ALSO SUCK THEY SHOULD BE USING A SINGLE BLADE LIKE BOSCH ICON RATHER THAN THE 1980 S STYLE WIPER FURTHERMORE THE DOOR MIRRORS SH
YES IT HAS REAR CAMERA BUT I PERSONALLY LIKE VISIBILITY
THREE QUARTERS VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR DUE TO SMALL REAR WINDOWS
THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA PICTURE COULD BE IMPROVED
THE FRONT ROOF PILLAR HAS A STEEP SLOPE AND IS TOO WIDE IT DIMINISHES THE FRONT VIEW NOW THAT I M CONSCIOUS OF IT I LOOK VERY CAREFULLY
REAR WINDOW AND REAR SIDES ARE TINY AND POOR VISIBILITY FOR CHANGING LANES IN TRAFFIC
POOR CRASH TEST RATING WORRIES ME
1 BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM NEEDS OPTIONAL SWITCH TO ALLOW BEEPS EVERY TIME BLIND SPOT LIGHT TURNS ON 2 BLIND SPOT LOOK ANGLE NEEDS TO BE TWICE AS LARGE AS CURRENT FACTORY SET ANGLE I KEEP ENCOUNTERING CARS THAT THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM DOE
REAR BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE IT TAKE A WHILE TO GET USE TO
THE FRONT LEFT PILLAR BLOCKS VISIBILITY AND THE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL TO SEE BLINDSPOT
I GOT THIS VEHICLE IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY FEATURES BECAUSE I HAVE A NEWBORN AND WANTED TO FEEL SAFE WITH HER IN THE VEHICLE
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAVE HAD A VEHICLE THAT WARNS ME IF THERE IS A VEHICLE IN MY BLIND SPOT AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A SILLY NEW IDIOT LIGHT BUT AFTER HAVING DRIVEN THE CAR I DO NOT WANT A CAR WITHOUT THIS FEATURE IN THE FUTURE
BAD BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE WHEN DRIVING
IT NEEDS THE SAFETY FEATURES OF THE NEW ROUGE PLUS MORE
BACK UP CAMERA AND LANE DEPARTURE MAKE UP FOR SHORT COMINGS ON REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY
THE REASON I LIKE SUV S IS FOR THE HEIGHT AND ADDED VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING IN TRAFFIC THIS MODEL WAS REDESIGNED AND NOW I AM MORE AT THE LEVEL OF A CAR THAN AN SUV SO VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD
BECAUSE OF REAR SEAT HEADREST VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS POOR
REAR WINDOW IS VERY SMALL REAR BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BIG GOOD THING THERE IS A CAMERA
THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT IN THE BACK PASSENGER SIDE
REALLY LIKE BIRDS EYE VIEW
A REAR VIEW CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT IN SUCH A VEHICLE
THE COLOR OF THE WARNING LIGHTS FOR THE BLINDSPOT NOTIFICATION IS HARD TO SEE IN THE DAYTIME
VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING LEFT SECONDARY TO WHERE THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS AND WHERE I HAVE MY SEAT ADJUSTED FORWARD I AM SHORT AND IT BLOCKS MY VISIBILITY SOME I HAVE TO LEAN FORWARD TO BE SURE I CAN SEE THAT I AM CLEARING THE CORNER ALSO THE
STILL HAS BLIND SPOTS THAT HINDER BACKING UP AND SIDE VIEWS
SIDE MIRRORS CREATE A BLIND SPOT FOR SHORTER PEOPLE
THE VEHICLE RIDES A BIT HIGH AND THERE IS EXCELLENT DRIVER VISIBILITY I M GENUINELY IMPRESSED WITH HOW WELL DESIGNED THIS VEHICLE REALLY IS
I HAVE FOUND THE THERE IS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT WHILE LOOKING OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS TO THE LEFT OF THE VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING
VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WIDOW IS VERY POOR NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL OR INVEST IN A REAR VIEW CAMERA
THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTRAINTS OBSTRUCT THE DRIVER S REAR VIEW MUCH MORE SO ON MY XTERRA AS COMPARED TO MY XTERRA
NEED BETTER FRONT ANGLE VISIBILITY
REAT SEAT HEADREST INTERFERES WITH REAR VIEW
THIS IS AN EXTREMELY WELL CONSTRUCTED SUV TOUGH RELIABLE APPROPRIATELY STYLISH EASY TO DRIVE SOLID SAFE AND A GREAT VALUE BEST VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED FOR DRIVING ON SNOW AND ICE LOVE THE NEW BACK UP CAMERA
SURPRISINGLY GOOD REARWARD VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER S SEAT FOR A 2 SEAT SPORTS COUPE
THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE WAS THE HIGH VISIBILITY IT OFFERED
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WITH THE HEAD RESTS IN THE BACK SEAT AND THE BACK LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE CAR I MAY REMOVE THE HEAD RESTS IN THE SECOND ROW THEY ARE TOO HIGH WHAT I CAN T SEE OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER I CAN SEE WITH THE PASSENGER REAR VIEW M
MAKE BLIND SPOT WARNING STANDARD MY MACAN DID NOT COME WITH IT BUT THAT WASN T ENOUGH TO KEEP ME FROM BUYING THE CAR HOWEVER IT FEELS SILLY TO BE DRIVING AROUND AND SEE A FORD WITH BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHTING UP WHILE MY PORSCHE DOESN T
VERY POOR VISIBILITY BACKING UP AND LARGE SIDE BLIND SPOT
REAR VISIBILITY IS RESTRICTED BUT THAT S RESULT OF THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE I DIDN T OPT FOR REAR A VIEW CAMERA
IT HAS UNACCEPTABLY LARGE BLIND SPOTS
I M VERY HAPPY WITH THE VISIBILITY IN THE MACAN AND THE FEELING OF SAFETY WHILE DRIVING IT FEELS VERY STABLE AND PLANTED AT ALL TIMES NO MATTER WHAT THE DRIVING CONDITIONS ARE
WHEN GOING AROUND BENDS TO THE RIGHT PASSENGER SIDE THE VISION IS OBSCURED BY THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE DRIVERS POSITION IS HIGH UNLIKE MOST SMALL CARS GIVING A COMMANDING VIEW OF THE ROAD ALONG WITH PROPER SIDE VIEW MIRROR ADJUSTMENT TO ELIMINATE BLIND SPOTS MAKES VISIBILITY EXCEPTIONAL
REARWARD VISIBILITY BACKING OUT OF A PARKING AREA IS A LITTLE TOUGH BUT I KNEW THAT WOULD BE THE CASE WITH THE DESIGN OF THE CAR A STANDARD REAR VIEW CAMERA WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE EVEN ON THE BASE PACKAGE
PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT IS LARGE AND CAN ONLY BE SLIGHTLY REDUCED BY ADJUSTING MIRRORS REAR VISIBILITY IS HINDERED BY MESH WIND SCREEN
SINCE THE CAR IS NOT EQUIPPED WITH REAR CAMERA IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE BEHIND
RIGHT HAND REAR BLIND SPOT IS ESPECIALLY TOUGH DUE TO THE HIGH NATURE OF THE BACK SEATS
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE BIG IN THIS CAR I REALLY WISH IT HAD BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND REAR TRAFFIC ALERT AT LEAST LOVE THE LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY AND ITS SHARPNESS AND STABILITY AROUND THE CORNERS
REAR VISIBILITY IS BAD NEEDS BACKUP CAMERA
BLIND SPOT FOR DRIVER WHEN LOOKING TO RIGHT SIDE FOR TRAFFIC MUST MOVE PASSENGER HEADREST FORWARD I M SHORT SO IT S AN EXAGGERATED ISSUE
THEIS CARE NEEDS A BACKUP CAMERA IT S REALLY HARD TO SEE BEHIND THE CAR S REAR WHEN BACKING UP ALSO AWFUL BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING FROM DRIVEWAY AND LOOKING FOR ONCOMING CROSS TRAFFIC
PART OF THE REASON FOR PURCHASING THE SUBARU WAS THE VISIBILITY EXCELLENT
REARWARD VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED
REAR VISIBILITY IS BAD WHEN TURNING HEAD
I REALLY LIKE THE VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE
LOTS OF VISIBILITY LIKE BEING IN A FISH BOWL
MOVING SIDE MIRRORS BACK ON DOORS AN EXCELLENT WAY TO IMPROVE FRONT QUARTER DRIVER VISIBILITY
GREAT VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT QUALITIES THAT I LOOK FOR IN A CAR AND MY CURRENT CAR MEETS MY STANDARDS
EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY AND SAFETY ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS FOR PURCHASING THE CAR
THE VISOR ANGLE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE SEEMS A BIT OFF SOMETIMES SEEMS TO IMPAIR MY VIEW OUT REAR VIEW MIRROR AND DOESN T SEEM BIG ENOUGH FOR ADEQUATE SUN PROTECTION ON SIDE
I FEEL SAFE IN IT VISORS COULD BE IMPROVED MY ROUTE HOME PUTS ME DRIVING INTO SETTING SUN AND WINDING ROADS MEANS I M FLIPPING VISOR AROUND AND IT DOESN T ALWAYS DO THE TRICK ALSO EYE SIGHT GETS BLINDED AND THE CRUISE CONTROL CUTS OFF I WOULD
I THINK IT CAN USE SLIGHTLY WIDER MIRRORS OR POSSIBLY VERY SLIGHTLY CURVED MIRRORS BUT THIS IS PROBABLY MY PREFERENCE I LIKE TO SET MY MIRRORS SO I CAN SEE A LITTLE OF THE SIDE OF MY VEHICLE AND AS MUCH OF TRAFFIC AS POSSIBLE IT S A LITTLE DI
THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM IS FANTASTIC
THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO BLIND SPOTS IT IS HARD TO GET USED TO
ADDITION OF THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR WOULD BE A WELCOME DRIVING SAFETY ADDITION ADDITION OF AUDIBLE WARNING OF THE OBSTACLE OUTSIDE THE VIEW OF REAR CAMERA WOULD IMPROVE SAFETY DURING BACK UP MANEUVERS
I FEEL SAFE IN THE VEHICLE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS ALSO A GREAT FEATURE
IT IS EASIER TO SEE ALL AROUND THIS VEHICLE THAN OTHER CARS IT HAS EXTRA LITTLE WINDOWS THAT REDUCE BLIND SPOTS MORE THAN NORMAL
THE TINT ON THE WINDSHIELD PREVENTS HEADLIGHT GLARE AT NIGHT
EYE SIGHT TECHNOLOGY LIMITS EFFECTIVENESS OF SIDE VISORS EVEN WITH VISOR EXTENSIONS
GOOD VISIBILITY FROM ALL DIRECTIONS
SWITCHED TO A SUBARU BECAUSE OF SAFETY AND AWD
REALLY GREAT VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD FOR A VEHICLE OF THIS SIZE THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT S HARD TO TELL WHERE THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE REALLY IS
REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD FOR A SEDAN DROVE SEVERAL OTHER MAKES MODELS AND VISIBILITY WASN T VERY GOOD WE WERE GOING TO BUY AN AWD SEDAN LOTS OF COMPETITORS BUT WE CHOSE THE LEGACY SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE VISIBILITY
ANTI COLLISION SAVED ME FROM AN ACCIDENT REAR COLLISION DETECTION ALSO PREVENTED AN ACCIDENT
WE WANTED A VEHICLE THAT WOULD BE SAFER TO DRIVE ON LONG TRIPS THE STANDARD SAFETY FEATURES WORK GREAT AND WE PAY ATTENTION TO THEM BUT WE ALSO GOT THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM AND DAY OR NIGHT DRIVING ON THE INTERSTATE OR LARGE DIVIDED HIGHWAYS GIVES
THE SUN VISORS SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO BEHIND AROUND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THAT BAG UP CAMERA TAKES SOME GETTING USE TO NOT VERY RELIANT ON IT BECAUSE I STILL HAVE TO LOOK SIDE TO SIDE R L TO ENSURE NO TRAFFIC COMING
SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN BLIND SPOT WARNING LIVE AND LEARN
THE SAFETY FEATURES AND ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS ARE GREAT
LIKE THE ADDED VISIBILITY BETWEEN WINDOW AND WINDSHIELD
THE LANE DEPARTURE SYSTEM DOESN T WORK VERY ACCURATELY IN LOCAL TRAFFIC ALTHOUGH IT WORKS PRETTY WELL ON HIGHWAYS THE BLIND SPOT SENSING SYSTEM GOES OUT OF SERVICE RATHER TOO OFTEN
GAUGES ARE MOSTLY EASY TO READ BUT THERE IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION TOO DISTRACTING DUE TO IPOD PODCAST LISTING PROBLEM WOULD APPLE CARPLAY HELP
EYESIGHT IS AMAZING
AS A DRIVER THAT LIKES TO BACK INTO A PARKING SPACE I LOVE THE REARVIEW MIRROR VERY HELPFUL ALSO LIKE THE FACT THAT IF I AM BACKING OUT OF A SPACE CAR LETS ME KNOW AUDIBLY IF SOMEONE IS GOING BY
LIKE THE FOG LIGHTS AS YOU TURN IN A CORNER
WHEN LOOKING IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THE HEADRESTS FROM THE BACK ROW REALLY OBSTRUCT THE VIEW ALSO THE SEATBELT IN THE BACK ROW INTERFERES WITH MY VIEW THIS SEEMS TO BE THE DESIGN OF A LOT OF NEW VEHICLES AND NOT SPECIFIC TO SUBARU I JUST W
REAR SIDE OR LANE CHANGING VISIBILITY IS POOR WITH SEATBACK HEADRESTS IN PLACE LANE CHANGE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM SHOULD BE STANDARD ON VEHICLE TO IMPROVE SAFETY
THERE ARE MULTIPLE BLIND SPOTS BUT OVERALL STILL LOVE THE CAR
I ALWAYS FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE WHEN DRIVING MY LEGACY I LOVE THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE AND ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURES OF THE CAR
THE MIRRORS ARE LOCATED ON THE DOORS AND THIS ELIMINATES SOME POTENTIAL BLIND SPOTS I REALLY LIKE THIS FEATURE
LOVE THAT IT DIMS THE REAR VIEW LIGHTS
BLIND SPOT WARNING SHOULD BE MORE VISIBLE IN MIRRORS AND THE NOISE SHOULD BE LOUDER
VISIBILITY DECREASED WITH BACKING UP THE SEATS AND WINDOWS BLOCK VISIBILITY
WOULD LIKE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION STANDARD ON PREMIUM MODEL THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CLOSE CALLS HERE CAN YOU MAKE THIS STANDARD IN 2016
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE VISIBILITY WHEN MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN THEY HAVE POSITIONED THE SIDE MIRROR AND STRUCTURED THE WINDOW SO THAT I HAVE A CLEAR VIEW FOR INSTANCE WHEN I AM MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN INTO MY DRIVEWAY WHICH I DO INNUMERABLE
THE ONLY THING I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES THE BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES ARE VERY DANGEROUS COULDN T SEE THE OTHER CARS IN THE OTHER LANE WHEN I WANTED TO MOVE OVER BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS GOOD
HEADLIGHT ADJUSTMENT IS AMAZING
WISH THAT IT HAD A REAR BACK UP CAMERA INSTEAD OF JUST A PICTURE OF A FAKE CAR ON DISPLAY SCREEN
SHOULD HAVE AUTO DIMMING FOR REAR VIEW MIRROR
I THINK SOME OF THE FORDS HAVE A 2 PART OUTSIDE MIRROR THAT HELPS TO SHOW CARS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THAT FEATURE
I HARDLY HAVE A BLIND SPOT ON EITHER SIDE OF EACH FRONT SEATS THIS IS GREAT VISIBILITY
THE REAR WIPER SPRAYER IS PRETTY WEAK
I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE VEHICLES VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY FEATURES ONE OF THE REASONS I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE WAS FOR THE REAR CAMERA WHEN BACKING UP
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS EASY TO USE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE
TUNNEL VISION HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW REAR CAMERA EQUIPPED YES HOWEVER BLIND SPOTS ARE STILL THERE ITS NOT PANORAMIC VIEW
AS MENTIONED EARLIER I FEEL THE BACKUP CAMERA AND SUBSEQUENT SCREEN ON THE DASHBOARD ARE NOT ONLY A WASTE OF SPACE BUT GIVES THE DRIVE A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY IF YOU USE IT TO BACK THE CAR OUT OF A SPACE YOU CANNOT SEE IF THERE IS A PERSON
REAR HEAD RESTS BLOCK VISIBILITY
THERE ARE MANY BLIND SPOTS IN THE COUNTRYMAN COMPARED TO OTHER CARS I HAVE DRIVEN I FEEL SAFE BEING IN THE VEHICLE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS A SOLID BUILT CAR HOWEVER I DON T FEEL SAFE DRIVING IT DUE TO THE BLIND SPOTS AND DIFFICULTY OF SEEING
THE WINDSHIELD WASHER SPRAYERS SPRAY IN A SOLID STREAM INSTEAD OF AN EVEN SPRAY I END UP USING MORE THEN I NEED AND IT TENDS TO TAKE A WHILE TO SPREAD ALONG THE ENTIRE WINDSHIELD IT S GRUELING MY ONLY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE CAR AND GETTING IT
INTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO LARGE IT BLOCKS VISIBILITY TO THE RIGHT OF CENTER SMALLER MIRROR WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME
REAR VIEW MIRROR IS MUCH SMALLER THAN OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE DRIVEN I WOULD PREFER FOR IT TO BE A LITTLE LARGE FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT NOT EQUIPPED WITH DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS
GREAT FIELD OF VISION ALL THE WAY AROUND BACKUP CAMERA IS HANDY IN BACKING SITUATIONS
THERE IS ALWAYS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT NO MATTER WHAT HOWEVER THIS IS BETTER THAN MY LAST VEHICLE
REAR VISIBILITY A BIT LIMITED
THE HEAD RESTS ON THE BACK SEAT BLOCK A LOT OF VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING OUT THE SIDES
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT AT LEAST ON THE RIGHT SIDE
HEAD RESTS IN REAR SEAT BLOCK SOME OF THE VIEW THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
SOMETIMES THERE IS A BLIND SIDE IF THERE WAS SOUND THAT LET YOU KNOW THERE IS A CAR ON YOUR BLIND SIDE THAT WOULD HELP
FOG LIGHTS SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT DON T HAVE THEM BUT PLAN TO GET INSTALLED
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I BOUGHT THE OUTLANDER WAS BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY FEATURES THE CAR IS BUILT WELL AND IS VERY RELIABLE
THE LEFT RIGHT BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS NEW TO ME SO I AM GETTING USED TO RELYING ON IT WHILE ENSURING THAT I DRIVE SAFELY ANYWAY BUT IT IS CLEARLY A STRONG ADVANTAGE FOR ME AS A DRIVER THE VISORS ARE OK BUT I THINK THEY ARE SLIGHTLY LES
I WISH TOYOTA WOULD INSTALL INTEGRATED BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOWS THE CAMERA HELPS ALSO HARD TO SEE THE LOCK UNLOCK BUTTONS ON THE DRIVER SIDE PANEL
VISORS ARE GARBAGE AND HAS VEHICLE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
I WOULD FEEL BETTER IF I HAD UP AND DOWN MOBILITY OF THE SEAT FOR BETTER VISIBILITY CAPABILITY
WISH THE LE MODEL CAME WITH BLIND SPOT MONITORS
IT SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN I GLANCE OVER MY SHOULDER BEFORE A LANE CHANGE
HEAD LIGHT IS GOOD AND VERY WHITE BUT THE FOG LIGHT IS YELLOWISH WHEN YOU TURN ON FOG LIGHT VISIBILITY TURNS FROM WHITE TO YELLOW
REAR HEADRESTS INTERFERE WITH VISIBILITY OUT BACK WINDOW
I THINK THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS NOT AWFUL BUT COULD BE BETTER
REAR WIPER BLADE NEEDS TO FULLY SWING 180 DEGREES AS IT LEAVES A DIRTY SPOT RIGHT IN FIELD OF REAR VISION IF NOTHING ELSE IT NEEDS TO SWING FROM THE REVERSE SIDE AS THIS WAY IT WILL CLEAR THAT BLIND SPOT EVEN IF ARM DOESN T SWING THE FULL 180 D
WHEN RAINING THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORK VERY WELL AND THE LARGE WINDSHELD PROVIDES EXCELLANT VISABILITY
I DON T LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA THE LENS SEEMS TO GET ROAD FILM ON IT CONSTANTLY WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF ALSO THE FIELD OF VIEW SEEMS TOO NARROW
THERE IS POOR VISIBILITY WHEN USING THE HEADLIGHT S LOW BEAMS THERE IS A VERY DISTRACTING OBVIOUS DARK LINE WHERE THE LIGHT ENDS AND THE LIGHT DOES NOT EXTEND FAR ENOUGH IN FRONT OF THE CAR
MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP AND PARKING WHEN I PARK IN A TIGHT SPACE IT LIKES I AM GOING TO HIT THE CAR ON MY RIGHT ALTHOUGH I MAY HAVE 2 OR 3 FEET OF SPACE THIS DIDN T HAPPEN WITH MY FIRST 2 COROLLAS AND MY 2 CAMRYS ALSO IT S HARD TO S
I WISH THERE WAS A BLIND SPOT CAMERA CIRCULAR MIRROR
LANE DEPARTURE AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING ARE VERY HELPFUL FUNCTIONS
REAR VIEW MIRRORS BLOCK SIGHT WHEN MERGING ONTO FREEWAY
REAR CAMERA NEEDS TO BE CLEANED OFTEN
BLIND SPOTS TO THE LEFT FRONT OF CAR
WITHOUT THE REAR CAMERA I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE
REAR VISIBILITY IT TERRIBLE IF THIS CAR DID NOT HAVE A BACKUP CAMERA I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED IT
CANNOT SEE OUT REAR HATCH WINDOW AT NIGHT TOO DARK WHEN BACKING UP NOT GOOD AT USING THE CAMERA ON DASH
I LIKE HOW THE DRIVER S SEAT RAISES HIGH UP FOR SHORTER PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE BETTER VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD
MENTIONED ELSEWHERE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS CAN BLOCK VISIBILITY OF VEHICLES PEDESTRIANS AND CYCLISTS WHEN ENTERING TRAFFIC FROM SIDE STREET
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE UP AND OVER BACK DASHBOARD WHEN BACKING UP REAR VIEW CAMERA IS NICE PLUS THOUGH
I LIKE THAT IT HAS SO MUCH VISIBILITY AND THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE OTHERS IN THE SAME CLASS HAVE MORE BLIND SPOTS
I FIND THE POOR REAR VISIBILITY A MAJOR SHORTFALL OF THE PRIUS
LIMITED BLIND SPOT DETECTION THE LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY IS COMPENSATED FOR WITH THE REAR VIEW CAMERA WHEN NOT COVERED WITH DEBRIS
SIGHT LINES ARE POOR BECAUSE OF CURTAIN AIR BAGS
WISH TOYOTA WOULD DEVELOP A HEADS UP DISPLAY OF SPEED ETC ON WINDSHIELD ALSO WISH THEY WOULD INCLUDE LANE DEPARTURE COLLISION WARNING ETC ON ALL HIGHLANDER MODELS NOT JUST TOP OF THE LINE THE REAR CAMERA DISPLAY IS A VAST IMPROVEMENT OVE
THE READ VISIBILITY IS VERY LIMITED
GREAT FORWARD VISIBILITY BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE BLIND SPOT IS SOMEWHAT OBSCURED BY THE REAR LATERAL WINDOW BARS
YES DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY TOYOTA DID NOT INCLUDE LANE GUIDANCE WITH THE BACKUP CAMERA IT IS AVAILABLE ON OUR HIGHLANDER MANY OTHER TOYOTA MODELS AND CERTAINLY ON MANY COMPETITIVE MODELS DISAPPOINTING WHEN IT WOULD BE EASY TO DO SINCE YOU HAV
USE OF REAR VIEW MIRRORS IS HINDERED CONSIDERABLY BECAUSE OF DESIGN OF REAR COMPARTMENT
I NOTICED THAT THE REAR VIEW IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE BECAUSE THERE IS A BORDER SEPARATION BETWEEN ONE WINDOW TO ANOTHER THERE IS A LINE THAT RUNS ACROSS THE BACK WINDOW THAT SEPARATES THE WIPERS & A LOWER PART OF THE TRUNK IF IT WERE CO
BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE EDGE OF THE HOOD AND THERE SEEMS TO BE NO WAY TO RAISE THE DRIVER S SEAT TO IMPROVE THAT PROBLEM DISTANCE VISIBILITY IS OKAY BUT THE DRIVER S SEAT SEEMS UNNECESSARILY LOW
THE BAR IN THE BACK OVER THE CARGO AREA IMPEDES VISIBILITY
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT OUT TO THE BACK WINDOW
I CAN T SEE THE FRONT OF MY HOOD SO HARD TO GAUGE DISTANCE ALSO WITH THE LINE IN THE REAR VISIBILITY THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A DESIGN QUESTION FOR ME WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A LINE BAR IN THE MIDDLE OF YOUR REAR VISIBILITY
THERE SEEM TO BE MORE BLIND SPOTS IN THE PRIUS COMPARED TO OTHER CARS I HAVE DRIVEN
IF THERE WERE NO BLIND SPOTS IT WOULD BE AN AMAZING CAR
FRONT AND BACK VISIBILITY IS GREAT
I LIKE IT FEEL GOOD IN IT AND ABOUT IT AND ABOUT MY SAFETY AND THE SAFETY OF MY PASSENGERS
VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING UP IS OK NOT GREAT DEFINITELY NEED TO USE THE CAMERA AND MIRRORS SIMULTANEOUSLY
WHEN MAKING LEFT TURNS THE VISIBILITY IS OBSTRUCTED FROM THE PIECE BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE FRONT DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW I HAVE TO LEAN FORWARD TO SEE WHERE I M TURNING AND TO CLEARLY SEE MEDIAN
POOR REAR VISIBILITY DUE TO THE REAR HATCH DESIGN
WIPERS NEED MORE INTERVAL OPTIONS FRONT AND REAR SENSORS NEED MORE DISTANCE FOR OBJECT DETECTION TURN SIGNAL INDICATORS SHOULD BE VISIBLE FROM FRONT AND REAR OF VEHICLE ON THE EXTERNAL MIRRORS
REAR VISIBILITY IN PRIUSES SUCKS
DIFFICULT TO SEE FROM REARVIEW MIRROR WHEN DVD SCREEN IS DOWN
FAIRLY LARGE BLIND SPOT ABOUT 10 00 LOOKING OUT THE DRIVER S SIDE OF FRONT SEAT
THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES AND HEADLIGHTS ARE RATHER DIM UNLESS ON HIGH BEAMS
CONVEX SIDE VIEW MIRRORS BIG ONES LIKE PICKUP TRUCKS WITH TRAILER MIRRORS HAVE WOULD BE A NICE FEATURE
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM I THINK IT SHOULD BE A STANDARD SAFETY FEATURE ON EVERY NEW VEHICLE
BLIND SPOTS ARE BAD
LARGE BLIND SPOT ON BOTH SIDES WHEN CHANGING LANGES
THE SPEEDOMETER DOESN T HAVE BRIGHT ENOUGH LIGHTS TO BE VERY VISIBLE DURING DAY LIGHT THE AUDIO DISPLAY IS TOO BRIGHT AND DISTRACTING AT NIGHT
THE FRONT ROOF CORNER PANELS ARE FAIRLY WIDE CREATING SOMEWHAT OF A BLIND SPOT EITHER TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT
SMALL TRUNK WINDOW COUPLED WITH SMALL TAPERED BACK WINDOWS MAKE CHANGING LANES DIFFICULT SMALL TRUNK WINDOW ALSO MAKES REVERSING DIFFICULT BUT REAR VIEW CAMERA HELPS
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS HARD TO SEE BEHIND AND TO THE SIDES WIPERS ALWAYS LEAVE A FEW DROPS OF SPRAY ON THE WINDSHIELD AFTER WIPING NEVER FULLY CLEAN BECAUSE OF THIS VERY ANNOYING
I DO WISH THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE HAD THE FRONT END COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURE
REAR SEAT HEADRESTS ARE WAY TOO TALL AND RESTRICT REAR VISION
BLIND SPOTS TO REAR APPEAR LARGER THAN MY PRIUS
WOULD LIKE DUAL SUN VISORS ON DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE FRONT AND SIDE
XENON ADAPTIVE HEADLIGHTS WOULD MAKE A BIG IMPROVEMENT IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HEADLAMPS
LOVE OUR BACK UP CAMERA
THE CAB REAR VIEW MIRROR IS HARD TO SEE WITH A CAP INSTALLED OVER THE TRUCK BOX BUT THIS WAS EXPECTED THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS MAKE UP FOR THIS THE SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD HAVE THE SMALL WIDE VIEW BUTTON MIRRORS I INSTALLED MY OWN
SIDE PILLARS CREATE BLIND SPOTS
IT SHOULD HAVE BLIND SIDE MIRRORS
AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE FRONT HOOD IS A LITTLE BIT TOO LONG & BUMPED OUT FOR THE BEST VISIBILITY
VEHICLE COULD USE SMALL MIRROR ON SIDE MIRRORS TO SEE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
WOULD LOVE IT IF THE REAR VIEW CAMERA WOULD DISPLAY WHEN CHANGING LANES
NO BLIND SPOTS REAR VIEW CAMERA IS GREAT
 GOOD I VE BEEN TOLD BY FAMILY AND FRIENDS THE BACK SEATS GIVE THEM GOOD VISIBILITY OF THE OUTSIDE
GENERALLY VISIBILITY IS GOOD I FIND THAT THE WIDTH OF THE FRONT ROOF PILLARS AND THE SIDE MIRRORS CREATES A BLIND SPOT AT INTERSECTIONS
LOVE REARVIEW CAMERA
BIG BLINDS SPOTS WISH I WOULD HAVE GOT BLIND SPOT DETECTION
THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR S ARE A PROBLEM FOR ME WHEN I PASS VEHICLES THE ROUND SPOT MIRROR UP IN THE CORNER BLOCKS MY VISION SO I CAN T TELL IF I HAVE CLEARED THE VEHICLE I AM PASSING LIKED THE PREVIOUS MIRRORS BETTER
HARD TO SEE OVER LARGE HOOD ESPECIALLY WHEN PARKING VEHICLE FEELS SOLID AND SAFE WHEN DRIVING VISIBILITY IS GOOD FOR A LARGE VEHICLE WHEN DRIVING AND CHANGING LANES
I REALLY MISS THE RIGHT SIDE CAMERA THAT COMES ON WHENEVER TURNING RIGHT WITH BLINKER ON THAT MADE BLIND SPOTS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE LOVED THAT FEATURE AND WISH THIS CAR HAD IT
BLIND SPOT IS SOMEWHAT LARGER DUE TO THE LARGE SIZE OF THE TRUCK A REDESIGNED OUTSIDE REVIEW MIRROR WITH A BLINDSPOT FEATURE WOULD BE OF GREAT BENEFIT ADDING AN AFTERMARKET BLINDSPOT MIRROR ONTO THE EXISTING MIRROR MAKES A GREAT DIFFERENCE
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS VERY HANDY FOR GETTING AROUND IN PARKING LOTS
VEHICLE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE
BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE INCORRECTLY LOCATED THEY SHOULD BE IN THE LOWER OUTSIDE CORNER NOT THE UPPER
WITH A BACK WIND SHIELD THAT IS AS FLAT AS THE FRS S IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE A BACK WINDSHIELD WIPER THAT S JUST MY OPINION OTHERS MAY NOT AGREE
THE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVE SIDE IS LARGE I HAVE MADE LANE CHANGES TO THE LEFT CUTTING OFF PEOPLE BECAUSE I COULDN T SEE THEM
I HAVE MANY TOYOTA VEHICLES AND FOR SOME REASON THE TUNDRA SEEMS TO HAVE LEAST BRIGHTEST HEADLIGHTS
I HAVE ADDED CONVEX MIRRORS TO AID IN SEEING DRIVERS BESIDE ME THE BACK WINDOW IS NOT THE BEST TO SEE OUT OF I DON T KNOW IF IT S BECAUSE OF THE NUMEROUS LINES OF THE REAR DEFROSTING SYSTEM AND OR THE WINDOW TINT WHICH WAS DONE AT THE DEALERSHI
BLIND SPOTS ARENT TO BAD BUT THEY ARE THERE BUT EVERY CAR HAS THEM
REAR SEAT HEADRESTS RESTRICT REAR VIEW MIRROR EFFECTIVENESS
EXCELLENT DRIVING HANDLING NICE SAFTEY EQUIPPED AIRBAGS
FRONT PILLARS SOMETIMES BLOCK OBJECTS MOVING AT SIMILAR SPEED REAR HEADRESTS BLOCK REAR VISIBILITY I REMOVE THE REAR HEADRESTS WHEN THERE ARE NO PASSENGERS IN THE BACK
THE VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT IS NOT GOOD WHEN VISOR IS PULLED DOWN IT IS ALSO DIFFICULT TO CHECK YOUR BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
VEHICLE S VISIBILITY IS SO GREAT FOR THIS KIND OF SMALL SPORT CAR GOOD JOB
BLIND SPOTS ARE HORRIBLE IN THIS VEHICLE TOOK ME SOME GETTING USED TO WITH THE SMALL BACK WINDOWS
NO REAR CAMERA I WAS TOLD BY THE DEALER NO CAMERAS IN SCION VERY PROBLEMATIC BACKING UP WITH THE TC BECAUSE OF THE HATCHBACK WOULD HAVE PREFERRED REAR CAMERA TO BE STANDARD OR AVAILABLE AT THE LEAST
OVERALL VISIBILITY IS FINE COULD BE BETTER WHEN LOOKING OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER TO CHANGE LANES I HAVE FOUND THAT CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE A LITTLE TRICKY A PERSON WITH LIMITED FLEXIBILITY MAY HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY THE CAR S DESIGN IS SOMEWHAT BOXY CA
A MINOR BLIND SPOT BY THE BACK ROOF FRAME
BLIND SPOT IN SIDES OF REAR
SPOILER REDUCES REAR VIEW VISIBILITY
I REALLY LIKE THAT BLIND SPOTS ARE ALMOST NON EXISTENT
I DO HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING TO BACK UP REGARDLESS OF THE CAMERA MAYBE SOMEDAY I WILL START TRUSTING THE CAMERA BUT FOR NOW IT IS HARD TO TELL WHERE I AM GOING IN REVERSE
LOVE THE REAR CAMERA
GREAT FORWARD VISIBILITY
REAR CAMARA DISPLAY IS TOO SMALL
MANEUVERABILITY ADDS TO FEELING OF SAFETY
WISH IT HAS WIDE ANGLE SIDE MIRRORS FOR MORE VISIBILITY THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A BLIND SPOT VERY TINY BUT THERE
THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT FROM ALL ANGLES
VISIBILITY IS OVERALL PRETTY GOOD REAR WINDOW IS A LITTLE SMALL
ON ONE HAND I LIKE THE REAR MIRRORS DIMMING AT NIGHT BUT ALSO REDUCES VISIBILITY I WISH THEY INCLUDED PASSING WARNING LIGHT TO ASSIST WITH THIS FEATURE
HARD TO SEE REAR VISION CAMERA WHEN SUNNY OUTSIDE
REAR WIPER DOES NOT CLEAN MOST OF BACK WINDOW
VISIBILITY IS AMAZING
BEST VISIBILITY OF ANY MODERN COMPACT IVE DRIVEN
I WISH THE WRX PREMIUM CAME WITH LED HEADLIGHTS THE ONES THAT IT CAME WITH ARE ADEQUATE BUT SUBPAR COMPARED TO THE COMPETITION ALSO ONE OF MY FOG LIGHTS STOPPED WORKING
VISIBILITY IS PRETTY GOOD SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO QUICKLY LOOK OUT OF THE BACK
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH REAR VIEW BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT REAR PASSENGER HEADREST
I WISH THE BACK UP CAMERA ALSO MADE NOISE WHEN YOU GOT TOO CLOSE TO SOMETHING
A PILLARS COVER TOO MUCH AREA FACTORY INSTALLED BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ALA FORD WOULD BE A NICE TOUCH
LIKE THE EXTRA WEIGHT OF A SUV FOR SAFETY
DISPLAY SIZE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE REVIEW VIEW CAMERA IS VERY GOOD
I AM SHORT MAKING SUN VISORS TYPICALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE ACURA MDX HAD HALOGEN HEADLAMPS WHICH I DID LIKE MUCH MORE
LOVE THE FULL GLASS IN FRONT SIDE WINDOWS ELIMINATES BLIND SPOTS
REAR VIEW MIRROR S AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT TO DIM HEADLIGHT REFLECTION IS A GREAT ADDITION
FORWARD AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS GENERALLY VERY GOOD REAR VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REARVIEW MIRROR IS FINE BUT BACKING UP IS A CHORE THE CAR HAS A BACKUP CAMERA BUT THE DISPLAY IS TOO SMALL TO BE REALLY USEFUL IN COMPLICATED BACKING MANEUVERS T
I FEEL THIS CAR HAS GREAT VISIBILITY AND HANDLES REALLY WELL THIS ADDS TO THE OVERALL FEELING OF SAFETY
GREAT FORWARD AND SIDE VISIBILITY MIRRORS MOVED TO DOOR WITH ADDED CORNER WINDOW IS NICE EYESIGHT AND SIDE COLLISION NOTICE IS EXCELLENT FEELS GREAT DRIVING IN WET WEATHER NOT SURE IF I COULD FEEL SAFER IN ANY OTHER CAR
THE SIDE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM AND REAR WARNING SYSTEM ARE FANTASTIC  I HAVE ALREADY BEEN SAVED AT LEAST TWICE FROM LIKELY COLLISIONS WHEN BACKING AND CHANGING LANES
WOULD BE NICE IF REAR WIPER COVERED MORE OF THE WINDOW
REAR WINDOW WIPER IS NOT VERY EFFECTIVE IT DOESN T CLEAR MUCH OF THE BACK WINDOW
NOTICEABLE BLIND SPOT FOR DRIVER WHEN CHANGING LANES
I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHILE BACKING UP UNLESS I USE THE BACK UP CAMERA
THE VISIBILITY OF THE 15 WRX IS MUCH HIGHER THEN THE 13 THE SMALL WINDOW NEAR THE SIDE MIRRORS HELP WITH SHARP TURNS IN PARKING LOTS AND SAME GOES WITH THE SMALL REAR ONES HELPS WITH LANE CHANGES THE CAR IS SOLID BUT NOT HARSH THE ONLY THING
THE BLIND SPOT FOR CHANGING LANES SEEMS TO BE GREATER THAN FOR MY PREVIOUS 1996 CAMRY I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING OVER THE HOOD WHEN DRIVING UP DOWN A HILL I M GOING TO TRY RAISING THE SEAT TO SEE IF THAT HELPS MY HUSBAND AND I LOVE THE REAR V
I FEEL THAT I HAVE SLIGHT BLIND SPOTS CONCERNING CHANGING LANES
BLIND SPOT MONITOR WOULD HELP LARGER REAR VIEW MIRROR A PILLAR DOES INTERFERE WITH MY VISION ESPECIALLY WHEN TURNING AND PEDESTRIANS POP OUT OF NOWHERE AND THINK IM A CARELESS DRIVER BECAUSE I HAVE TO STOP ABRUPTLY ABOUT 5 10FT BEFORE HITTING TH
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE A BIT SMALL IN MY OPINION I ADDED SPOT MIRRORS TO HELP WITH BLIND SPOTS BUT I THINK THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA
BLIND SPOT RIGHT BETWEEN PASSENGER SIDE DOORS VERY DANGEROUS
THE RIGTH BACK HEAD REST CAUSES A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT
WINDSHIELD WIPERS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AT SENSING MOISTURE WITH SNOW
AS NOTED ABOVE I SPEND A LOT OF TIME PEERING AROUND THE DOOR FRAME AND HEADRESTS BEFORE I CHANGE LANES AS IN ALL CARS THERE S A BLIND SPOT BETWEEN THE CENTER AND SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS I CAN T SPEAK TO MY OWN CAR S VISIBILITY BUT THE MARKER
I WISH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WAS AUTO DIMMING
IT IS THE SAFEST CAR I HAVE EVER HAD THE VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT
THE REAR WINDOW WHEN IT GETS FROSTED DOESN T DEFROST MAKING IT HARD TO SEE CARS IN MY REAR VIEW WINDOWS BLIND SPOT
THE BACK UP CAMERA DOES NOT MAKE A SOUND WHEN YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO AN OBJECT IT IS LITERALLY JUST A CAMERA WITH NO WARNING SYSTEM
WISH THEY OFFERED A BLIND SPOT WARNING FEATURE ALSO EVEN THOUGH IT S NOT A LOT BIGGER THAN MY LAST CAR VW JETTA WAGON TDI IT FEELS LARGER TO ME AND I M STILL ADJUSTING TO PARKING IT
I LOVE THE SHORT OVERALL LENGTH ABUNDANCE OF GLASS AREA AND UPRIGHT DESIGN THAT COMBINE TO GIVE EXCELLENT VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT IS DESIGNED FROM THE GROUND UP AS A HATCHBACK
REAR HEAD REST BLOCK REAR VIEW HAD TO REMOVE ALL THREE
I M TALL SO EVEN WITH SEAT IN LOWEST POSITION MY HEAD IS ABOVE MID LEVEL SO REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS LARGER THAN OTHER VEHICLES AND OBSCURES MY VISIBILITY AT TIMES
WINDOW EXPANSE IS LARGE ENOUGH THAT I DON T HAVE A BLIND SPOT
I LIKE THE LACK OF BLINDSPOTS
THE REAR CAMERA SHOULD HAVE A WIDER FIELD OF VISION
WISH IT HAD HID HEADLIGHTS AND LED LIGHTS
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A REALLY BIG BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY AND CHANGING LANES IF THERE IS A CAR DRIVING RIGHT AT THE REAR OF MY PASSENGER SIDE IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO SEE
I AM AN OLDER DRIVER AND I HAVE DIFFICULTY TURNING MY NECK TO LOOK BEHIND ME I DEPEND ON MY MIRRORS THIS STILL LEAVES A SMALL BLIND SPOT I INSTALL A SMALL AFTERMARKET CONCAVE MIRROR TO ASSIST IN VISIBILITY IN ALL MY VEHICLES
POOR VISIBILITY OF BLIND SPOT
OVERALL GOOD IF I HAD ONE THING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IT WOULD BE THAT THE SIDE MIRRORS DO NOT HAVE A GREAT VIEWING AREA I WILL BE CHANGING THESE MIRRORS TO CURVED BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
THE SOLID SPACE BETWEEN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND PASSENGER FRONT WINDOWS IS SLIGHTLY WIDER THAN IN MY 04 GOLF DECREASING DRIVER S VISIBILITY SLIGHTLY
SOME BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
REAR VIEW CAMERA IS SO SLOW TO BOOT UP THAT IT IS TOTALLY USELESS FOR BACKING OUT OF THE GARAGE AFTER THE CAR IS STARTED IN THE MORNING MY ACURA RDX IS PRETTY MUCH INSTANTANEOUS
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS USELESS AT NIGHT
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT THAT S DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME
LOVE THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA
THE BI XENON HEADLIGHTS ARE THE BEST I VE EVER HAD BETTER THAN THE GTI AND MY 2004 SAAB AERO
I GOT THE CAR FOR ITS SAFETY FEATURES AND HAVE NOT BEEN DISAPPOINTED
THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOTS HOWEVER I M STILL GETTING USED TO DRIVING THE BRAND NEW VEHICLE
IT HANDLES VERY WELL AND HAS GOOD BRAKING IT HAS A GOOD SIZE IT IS EASY TO SEE THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW WHEN BACKING UP AND EASY TO SEE THROUGH ALL THE SIDE WINDOWS WHEN HEAD CHECKING WHEN CHANGING LANES THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SAFETY FEATURE I RE
AUTOMATIC WIPERS ARE A REALLY HELPFUL FEATURE
I FEEL EXCEPTIONAL TRUST IN ALL THE SAFETY FEATURES OF MY VOLVO
VOLVO S HAVE BLIND SPOTS THEY ALL DO
CANNOT SEE THE FRONT OF THE HOOD DEPEND UPON THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM TO NOT BUMP INTO WHATEVER IS IN FRONT OF ME WISH I HAD A CAMERA ON THE FRONT TO KNOW IF ANYTHING IS IN FRONT OF THE CAR BEFORE ENGAGING TRANSMISSION INTO DRIVE
THE REASONS I PURCHASED THIS VEHICLE WAS BECAUSE OF THE SLEEK SPORTY DESIGN AND THE HISTORICAL SAFETY FACTOR THAT COMES WITH A VOLVO CAR
WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM THERE WOULD BE VERY BAD BLIND SPOT ISSUES
FOLDING REAR HEADRESTS ARE A GREAT FEATURE TO ENHANCE REARWARD VISABILITY
THE HIGH BEAMS ARE EXCEPTIONAL THE LANE CHANGE WARNING INDICATORS ARE TOO SENSITIVE
ONE OF THE REASONS I BOUGHT THIS CAR WAS BECAUSE THE VISIBILITY IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE OLD V70 WAS
I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE LIGHT WARNING FOR A BLIND SPOT VEHICLE TO BE IN THE OUTSIDE MIRROR RATHER THAN BEING PLACED ON THE FRONT DOORS
I FIND THE VISIBILITY TOWARD THE LEFT FRONT TO BE OBSTRUCTED
FEEL VERY SAFE BETWEEN THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING COLLISION AVOIDANCE AND SPEED COMPENSATING CRUISE CONTROL THERE ARE PLENTY OF SAFETY FEATURES
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO DARK AT NIGHT LIMITING VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES
THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS WHICH ACTIVATE WHEN THE WINDSHIELD GETS WET ARE A NICE TOUCH THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT CAR IS SOLID AND HAS A LEGACY OF SAFETY
WIPERS HAVE BEEN POOR SINCE WE PICKED UP THE VEHICLE BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGE WHEN CHANGING LANES
BLIND SPOT DETECTION MAKES COMPENSATES FOR ONLY FAIR REAR VISIBILITY VERY MUCH LIKE THE BLIND SPOT FEATURE THAT FLASHES WHEN YOU SIGNAL A LANE CHANGE AND SOMEONE IS IN BLIND SPOT THE LEFT LAND BLIND SPOT LIGHT IS IN DRIVERS PERIPHERAL VISION ON
DON T LIKE THE BACKUP CAMERA CANT SEE WHEN RAINING GET WET AND DIRTY WHEN SUN SHINING HARD TO SEE TOO WHEN BACKING THE SCREEN IS BLURRY AND NOT CLEAR TOOK TO DEALERSHIP SAID MADE THAT WAY
THE FORWARD VISIBILITY WIPERS AND HEADLIGHTS ARE AMAZING ESPECIALLY THE HEADLIGHTS
REALLY DIFFICULT TO SEE BLIND SPOT WE DON T HAVE THE DETECTING DEVICE
THE BLIND SPOT IS HUGE FOR SHORT PEOPLE
THERE ARE TWO REALLY BAD BLIND SPOTS THE RIGHT HAND BACK SEAT HAS A SUPPORT TO THE ROOF THAT CUTS OFF VISION TO THE RIGHT VERY BADLY ALSO THE LEFT SIDE WHILE BACKING COULD BE A LOT BETTER IF YOU WATCH THE BACKING CAMERA YOU DO NOT SEE ONCO
IT DOES NOT HAVE BLIND SPOT DETECTION OR CHANGING LANE HELP AND IT DOESNT HAVE A WARNING WHEN YOU ARE BACKING UP THAT YOU ARE CLOSE TO ANOTHER CAR
REAR VISIBILITY AND VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS WORSE THAN MY PREVIOUS GOLFS 2003
VOLVO EMPHASIZES THE SAFETY OF THE CAR BUT DON T PROVIDE A SPARE OR PLACE TO STORE SPARE IF OWNER PURCHASES I HAVE HAD 2 FLATS IN 4 MONTHS OF OWNING THE CAR & VOLVO SERVICE IS STATING THAT THE LOW PROFILE TIRES ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET FLATS FROM P
EXCELLENT ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL FORWARD RADAR CAMERA & LASER
THE WINDSHIELD WASHERS ARE STRAIGHT STREAMS OF FLUID PLEASE CHANGE THE WINDSHIELD WASHER SPRAYERS TO FAN THE FLUID SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS VOLVO MODELS ADDITIONALLY ADD AN OPTION TO ENABLE DISABLE THE HEADLIGHT WASHERS THEY WASTE A TREMENDOU
LANE DEPARTURE WARNING FRONT CAMERAS BLIND SPOT WARNING ARE ALL USEFUL
THE TINTED WINDOWS MAKE IT HARD TO SEE OUT THE REAR AND BACK WINDOWS WHILE CHANGING LANES AND BACKING UP
I LOVE THE STYLE OF THE VEHICLE BUT REWARD VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOWS IS COMPROMISED I KNEW THAT WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE BUT I LIKED THE STYLE SO MUCH IT WAS WORTH IT
VISIBILITY FORWARD AND TO THE LEFT IS MUCH IMPROVED OVER THE V50 WHERE THE SUPPORT POST FOR THE ROOF CONSTANTLY BLOCKED MY VIEW OF PEDESTRIANS APPROACHING FROM THE LEFT
APPRECIATE AND UTILIZE THE BLIND SPOT INFORMATION SYSTEM
AT TIMES DUE TO THE DRIVER S SIDE HEADREST AND THE WINDOW BAR BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR SEAT THERE MAY BE A BLIND SPOT THAT MIGHT HIDE AN OVERTAKING VEHICLE
I AM 4FT 11INCHES TALL I WOULD LIKE THE CAR TO HAVE THE OPTION OF PEDAL EXTENDERS I HAVE TO MOVE THE SEAT TOO FAR FORWARD FOR AIRBAG SAFETY BUT I DO IT ANYWAY SITTING THAT FAR FORWARD PUTS MY LINE OF SIGHT IN THE PASSENGER FRONT AIRBAG I H
NOT PLEASED WITH REAR VISIBILITY FEEL THAT I AM NOT GETTING TOTAL PICTURE HAVE TO LOOK BACK TO RECONFIRM EVERYTHING
NOT ENOUGH VISIBILITY FROM THE SIDES BLIND SPOTS
SEEMS TO HAVE A LARGER THAN NORMAL BLIND SPOT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL EFFORT WHEN LANE CHANGING BUT I WOULD ADD THAT IT IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR SPORTS CAR LOOKS
EASY TO DRIVE VISIBILITY IS GOOD SEE WELL AT NIGHT
REAR CAMERA NOT REAL CLEAR
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT VEHICLE WARNING AND THE AUTOMATIC HIGH BEAM
THERE ARE NO FRONT FOG LIGHTS AVAILABLE ON THE VEHICLE THERE IS A DEAD BUTTON WHERE I WOULD EXPECT THE FRONT FOG LIGHTS TO BE CONTROLLED
EVERYTHING IS EXCELLENT THE ONLY POSSIBLE ISSUE WHICH I AM SURE WOULD EFFECT ANY CAR WITH THIS FEATURE IS THAT DIRECTIONAL HEADLIGHTS CAN BE QUITE DISTRACTING WHEN DRIVING IN THICK FOG AS THEY ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE STEERING
WISH I HAD BLIND SPOT ALERT
LIMITED VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS AND GUIDANCE
INTERRUPTED VISIBILTY WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN BECAUSE OF VERTICAL WINDOW SUPPORT PLACEMENT
THE WINDSHIELD WASHERS WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY CAME FROM IN FRONT OF THE WINDSHIELD IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY INSTEAD OF FROM THE WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES
WIPERS DON T ALWAYS CLEAR THE WINDSHIELD ENTIRELY ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT LOVE THE REAR CAMERA AND LANE CHANGE WARNINGS IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
WISH IT HAD THE LIGHT INDICTORS IN THE MIRRORS FOR THE BLIND SPOT
LOVE THE SAFETY FEATURES THE SIDE WINDOW ALERTS THE ALERTS AROUND THE CAR WHEN SOMEONE IS APPROACHING OR WHEN I M ABOUT TO HIT SOMETHING THE REAR CAMERA WHEN BACKING UP AND PARALLEL PARKING ASSIST
BLIND SPOT TO BACK AND LEFT OVER DRIVERS SHOULDER
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS AND BACK UP CAM
IT IS HARD TO SEE WHEN PASSING   CHANGING LANES DUE TO THE VERY SMALL BACK SEAT SIDE WINDOW THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS HELPFUL BUT SEEMS A BIT TOO SENSITIVE OCCASIONALLY IT GOES OFF WHEN CARS NOT ACTUALLY IN THE ADJACENT LANE BUT ARE ONE MORE
HEADS UP DISPLAY SHOULD BE EQUIPED ON ALL X4 S FOR SAFETY
LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER S LEFT BUT THAT S DUE TO THE CONVERTIBLE TOP
CONVENTIONAL MIRRORS NEED TO GO WE DRIVE FAST IN SPORTS CARS AND NEED QUICK REAR VISUAL AID MAYBE CAMERA MIRRORS OR A CAMERA HEADER ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD
REAR VISIBILITY WHILE BACKING COULD BE IMPROVED
REAR VISIBILITY POOR DUE TO WING ON GT3
VISIBILITY FROM THE 2 REAR CORNERS IS LIMITED DUE THE SOFT TOP DESIGN BUT THE DESIGN IS SO GOOD AND SIDE MIRRORS AND REAR CAMERA ARE SO EFFECTIVE THAT IT S FINE SUN VISORS SHOULD BE TELESCOPING I VE THOUGHT THAT SINCE MY FIRST 1978 911 SC
REAR VISIBILITY LIMITED WHEN BACKING REAR PARKING SENSORS OR CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD
RESTRICTED REAR VISIBILITY THOUGH I M NOT SURE THERE IS ANYTHING THAT COULD BE DONE TO IMPROVE IT GIVEN CAR S STYLING
WOULD LIKE BACK UP CAMERA
SERIOUSLY NEEDS A BLIS SYSTEM
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT GT3 WING BLOCKS MOST OF THE VIEW BASIC 911 CARS HAVE EXCELLENT REAR VIEW VISIBILITY
THE WING BLOCKS REAR VISABLITY
BEING A SMALL CAR VISIBILITY FOR OTHER BIGGER VEHICLES IS A CONCERN ONE REASON I CHOSE BRIGHT YELLOW
THE FEELING OF SAFETY IS UNSURPASSED
I FEEL THIS VEHICLE IS EXTREMELY SAFE THE ONLY AREA THAT COULD USE IMPROVEMENT IS IN THE REAR CAMERA I PREVIOUSLY HAD AN AUDI Q7 AND THE REAR CAMERA ON THAT OPERATED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IN LOW LIGHT CONDITIONS THAT MY PORSCHE CAYENNE S REAR C
THE LED HEADLIGHTS PROVIDE GOOD LIGHTING AT NIGHT AND THE AUTO HIGHBEAM ASSISTANCE WORKS VERY WELL
BECAUSE DRIVING POSITION IS LOW DIFFICULT TO SEE THROUGH OR AROUND LARGER TALLER VEHICLES IN FRONT WHEN IN STOPPED SLOW TRAFFIC COMES WITH THE [SPORTS CAR] TERRITORY THOUGH
LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEM SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE ON A CAR AT THIS PRICE POINT
THIS IS A SOLID CAR WITH ALL OF THE LATEST SAFETY FEATURES I FRONT AND REAR BACK UP CAMERA WOULD BE NICE BUT NOT EXPECTED DUE TO THE WEIGHT SAVINGS PORSCHE EMPHASIZES ON THE GT3 VERSION OF THE 911 I SUPPOSE ONE COULD GET A 911 TURBO OR TURBO
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE APPEARS LARGER THEN USUSAL
THE NEW HIGH BELT LINE DESIGN OF ALL NEW VEHICLES HAS MADE THEM LESS SAFE TO DRIVE BECAUSE OF POOR VISIBILITY
THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE MAKES REAR VISIBILITY DIFFICULT I HAVE ALSO FOUND MERGING INTO TRAFFIC DIFFICULT DUE TO THE LARGE PILLAR BETWEEN FRONT DRIVER DOOR AND THE BACK DOOR I NOTICED THIS DURING MY INITIAL TEST DRIVE AND THAT S WHY I ORDERED T
THE CAR S RESPONSIVENESS ENHANCES THE OVERALL SENSE OF SAFETY
SUN VISORS ARE TOO SHORT AND NO LIGHTED MIRROR INCLUDED UNLESS YOU ORDER THE FULL LEATHER INTERIOR LOVE THE SAFETY FEATURE OF LANE CHANGE ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
LANE CHANGE ASSIST SHOULD BE A STANDARD ITEM NOT AN OPTION AS THIS IS A MUST FOR HELPING WITH BLIND SPOTS
FRONT FENDER ARE A BIT TOO TALL
VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK IS LIMITED I REMOVED THE REAR PASSENGER HEAD RESTS TO SEE BETTER
IT IS A LOW SLUNG SPORTS CAR THERE WILL ALWAYS BE COMPROMISES WITH SAFETY
B PILAR VERY WIDE CAUSING POOR DRIVER REARWARD VISIBILITY
THE MACAN IS SO STABLE AND ACCELERATES SO EFFORTLESSLY THAT I FEAR I WILL GET A SPEEDING TICKET BECAUSE I DIDN T REALIZE HOW FAST I WAS GOING THE SPEEDOMETER WORKS JUST FINE BUT IT FEELS LIKE I M JUST GOING 35 MPH WHEN I M ACTUALLY GOING 50
BLIND SPOT INDICATOR IS MOST HELPFUL
BLIND SPOTS ARE SLIGHTLY WORSE THAN EXPECTED
REAR WINDOW IS SMALL REDUCES VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOTS INCLUDE THE PASSENGER SIDE HEADREST WHEN LOOKING BACK
THE HEAD RESTS IN THE BACK SEAT BLOCK SOME OF THE VISIBILITY TO THE REAR
VISIBILITY AND SAFETY IS MORE THAN WHAT I EXPECTED
THE REAR CAMERA IS A LITTLE STRANGE LIKE CVR BETTER ALSO THEIRE IS A GLARE FROM DASHBOARD ONTO THE FRONT WINDOW IT TOOK TIME TO NOT NOTICE ON SUNNY DAYS
EVEN THOUGH THE REAR VIEW IS NARROW I WOULDN T CHANGE IT IF IT WOULD CHANGE THE OVERALL SLICK LOOK OF THE VEHICLE
ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL IS A GAME CHANGER
VISIBILITY IS NOT A PROBLEM
THE HEADRESTS BLOCK MUCH OF AN ALREADY SMALL REAR WINDSHIELD I OFTEN PUT THE SEATS DOWN TO IMPROVE VISIBILITY ALTERNATIVELY ONE COULD MAKE THE HEADRESTS ADJUSTABLE SO THAT THEY FALL FORWARD WHEN NOT IN USE AND ALSO CONSIDER ALWAYS MAKING THE M
EXCEPTIONAL SEAT POSITION AND WINDOW PLACEMENT FOR VISIBILITY
I WOULD LIKE BETTER VISIBILITY TO REAR  WHY CAN T I LOWER REAR HEADRESTS I VIRTUALLY NEVER HAVE ANYONE IN BACK SEATS
REAR VISIBILITY IS SOMEWHAT OBSTRUCTED BY THE REAR HEADRESTS BUT IS ACCEPTABLE
BECAUSE REAR VISIBILITY IS SO POOR LARGER MIRRORS OR MULTI VIEW MIRRORS WOULD BE HELPFUL CHANGING LANES EVEN WITH LCA IS DIFFICULT IN CONGESTED TRAFFIC OR BAD WEATHER
REAR CAMERA COLOR OPTIONS INTERFERES WITH REAR VISION
YOUR A B C PILLARS ARE STILL TOO THICK AND BLOCK THE DRIVER S VIEW OF CARS AND PEDESTRIANS
REAR HEADRESTS OBSCURE VISIBILITY IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY COULD FOLD DOWN JUST THE HEADRESTS AS THEY DO IN MY FORD
SIGHT LINES AND GENERAL VISIBILITY IS BAD WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPOT
THE VW BEETLE CLASSIC HAS A TOP SAFETY RATING FROM US NEWS & WORLD REPORT THE VEHICLE FEELS SOLID AND THE VISIBILITY IN BOTH FRONT & REAR ARE ABOVE AVERAGE FOR A VEHICLE THIS SIZE THE ONLY SAFETY FEATURE THAT IS LACKING ON THE VW BEETLE CLAS
STANDARDIZE APPROACH SENSORS COLLISION SENSORS AND REAR VIEW CAMERA BY THIS I MEAN HAVE IT IN ALL THE VEHICLES AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT
REAR HEADRESTS DIMINISH DRIVERS REAR VISIBILITY SOMEWHAT
SPEEDOMETER LACKS ODD MPH NUMERAL DISPLAYS E G 30 50 70 ETC REQUIRES LONGER THAN NORMAL EYES ON EFFORT TO DETERMINE SPEED TOO LONG EYES OFF THE ROAD DISTRACTION A SERIOUS UNNECESSARY OMISSION IN MY OPINION
CONVERTTIBLE ROOF HAMPERS VISIBILITY FOR DRIVER OVER LEFT RIGHT SHOULDERS
LARGE BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT REAR SIDE WHILE DRIVING
THE WIPERS DO A VERY BAD JOB OF CLEANING THE FRONT WINDSHIELD DUE TO THE HEAD RESTS IN THE BACK SEAT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW THE TINY SIDE WINDOWS MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT
JUDGING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE CAR S EXTERIOR TAKES A LITTLE GETTING USED TO BECAUSE OF THE WIDE REAR FENDERS BUT AFTER A FEW DAYS ADJUSTING VISIBILITY IS NOT A PROBLEM
LARGE BLIND SPOTS IN REAR OF VEHICLE DIFFICULT TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES WHEN BACKING UP OR CHANGING LANES
I WISH THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS HAD THE SMALL INSERT MIRROR THAT HELPS WITH THE BLIND SPOT OF OTHER CARS BESIDE YOU
AS I SAID PREVIOUSLY I AM SHORT AND WOULD APPRECIATE A FACTORY INSTALLED BACK UP CAMERA I WOULD EVEN BE WILLING TO TAKE THE CAMERA OVER THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ALL I SEE WHEN I TURN AROUND TO LOOK THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW IS THE SPOILER I HAVE H
GETTING USED TO THE SEMI BLIND SPOT CHANGE OF LANES READ SPOT CAN BE TOUGH
REAR CAMERA SEES WHAT I CAN T
IT S A CONVERTIBLE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS WHEN TOP IS UP BUT WE STILL LOVE IT
CONVERTIBLE TOP DOES DIMINISH SOME VISIBILITY
I LOVE THE FOG LIGHTS THEY REALLY HELP WITH OVERALL VISIBILITY AT NIGHT THERE WAS A RECALL ON THE HEADLIGHTS THANK YOU VW FOR CARING AND GETTING THIS INFO OUT TO THE CUSTOMER
FOG LAMPS ARE A NICE ADDITION TO THE FORWARD VISIBILITY
IT CAN SOMETIMES BE A LITTLE HARD TO SEE BEHIND ME WHEN REVERSING BUT I WAS USED TO DRIVING A TRUCK BEFORE THIS VEHICLE AND I ALSO HAVE A HIGH PROFILE SPOILER ON THIS VEHICLE SO THAT AFFECTS THE REAR VISIBILITY
THE FRONT AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT IN FACT IT IS ONE OF THE TOP THINGS I LOOKED FOR WHEN I TEST DROVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CARS BECAUSE I DO NOT LIKE TO RELY ON THE BACK UP CAMERA AND OR WARNING SYSTEMS THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO BLIND SPOT IN
SOME OF THE PILLARS ARE A BIT BULKY BUT DOESN T POSE A SAFETY CONCERN
BEST VISIBILITY AND FEELING SAFE WHILE DRIVING
THE BLIND SPOT IS THE ONE SPOT THAT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WITH THE THICKNESS AND LOCATION OF THE FRAME OF THE CAR BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR WINDOW NOT SO MUCH ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BUT ON THE DRIVER SIDE WHEN CHECKING THE LEFT BLIND SPOT NEED C
THE HEADLIGHTS WITH THE TURN FEATURE IMPROVES VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING
NOT MUCH SMALL CAR IS A SMALL CAR IN TERMS OF SAFETY
SOMETIMES I FEEL THE BLIND SPOT IS PRETTY BIG WHEN CHANGING LANES CHANGING THE DESIGN OF THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS AND OR CHANGING THE SPACE BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOORS TO MINIMIZE THE VISUAL BLOCKAGE
REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT VERY GOOD
VEHICLE IS WELL ENGINEERED AND VISIBILITY IS GOOD FROM ALL ANGLES
I DO FEEL LIKE I M SITTING IN THE BOTTOM OF A BATHTUB ESPECIALLY WHEN CHANGING LANES ALL OF MY ACCIDENTS HAVE BEEN IN REVERSE I M A LITTLE TOUCHY ABOUT BACKING UP VEHICLE COULD USE A BACKUP CAMERA
I WOULD MAKE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA STANDARD IT IS HARD TO SEE IN THE BACK WITH THE CONVERTIBLE TOP ON
THE RADICAL AND AWESOME DESIGN OF THE REAR OF THE V COUPE DOES LEND ITSELF TO GREAT REARWARD VISIBILITY I KNEW THIS GOING IN SO NOT A REAL PROBLEM THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A NICE TOUCH FOR PARKING CAR IS AWESOME
NEEDS A CAMERA ON THE FRONT ALSO
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE SELF DIMMING HEADLIGHTS THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL VEHICLES
SIDE MIRRORS ARE SMALL BUT IT S UNDERSTANDABLE CONSIDERING SPORTINESS IS AN IMPORTANT SELLING POINT FOR THE VEHICLE THERE ARE CLEAR BLIND SPOTS BECAUSE OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE WINDSHIELD YIELDS GREAT FORWARD LOOKING
AS I NOTED BEFORE THE NIGHT VISIBILITY THROUGH THE 360 DEGREE AND BACKUP CAMERAS IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE
SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS MAKES DRIVING A LITTLE DIFFICULT
SINCE MY REAR CAMERA IS NOT OPTIMAL REVERSING IS NOT SAFE
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FRONT THE BACK RIGHT HEADREST
SLIGHT BLIND SPOT WITH FRONT DRIVER SIDE
BLIND SPOTS WISH I WOULD HAVE HAD OPTION TO GET THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM
SIDEWAYS VISIBILITY
B PILLARS CREATE A LARGE BLIND SPOT WHEN GLANCING OVER TO DOUBLE CHECK FOR SIDE CLEARANCE OR ALONG SIDE TRAFFIC
THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS ARE AN AMAZING ASPECT
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
BIG VEHICLE WHICH NATURALLY MAKES VISIBILITY DIFFICULT
IMPROVE ON THE BLIND SPOT WARNING
NEEDS TO INCLUDE A FRONT LOWER CAMERA AS WELL TO SEE CURBS AND POSTS IN FRONT
CONSOLE TOUCHSCREEN IS INCONVENIENT SHOULD BE GLARE RESISTANT AND SHOULD BE FINGERPRINT RESISTANT
THE SMALLER REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE A BIG MISTAKE
POOR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN ESPECIALLY BAD AT NIGHT IT SEEMS THE SUPPORT BEAM FROM ROOF LINE TO DASH LINE IS RIGHT IN MY LINE OF SIGHT I HAVE TO ADJUST TO ENSURE I M CLEAR OF OBSTRUCTIONS OR ROAD HAZARDS AND TRAFFIC
HARD TO SEE THROUGH BACK WINDOWS BACKUP CAMERA IS GREAT REARVIEW MIRRORS GIVE GOOD VISABILITY
THERE SEEMS TO BE A FAIRLY BIG BLIND SPOT ON THE VEHICLE THE MIRRORS AND ADDITIONAL FEATURES HELP WITH THIS
IT IS VERY COMFORTING THAT THE VEHICLE DETECTS HAZARDS THAT I MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN UNAWARE THE VEHICLE S SENSORS THEREFORE ENHANCE MY VISIBILITY WITHIN ANY BLIND SPOTS
LOVE ODOMETER ON WINDSHIELD SO I DON T HAVE TO LOOK DOWN LOVE VIBRATING SEAT FOR WARNINGS
HAS SOME BLIND SPOTS THAT YOU HAVE TO GET USE TO
THE HIGH TECH SAFETY FEATURES ARE WONDERFUL KEEP MY FAMILY SAFE AND HAS IMPROVED MY SAFE DRIVING
GREAT VISABILITY AROUND VEHICLE REAR VIEW CAMERA COULD USE SOME WORK THOUGH NOT VERY HIGH CONTRAST AND RESOLUTION IS PRETTY LOW
THE 360 CAMERA SYSTEM IN THIS ESCALADE IS SO BAD THAT YOU CAN T SEE ANYTHING WHEN BACKING UP OR PARKING IN TERMS OF VISIBILITY IT IS TERRIBLE GM NEEDS TO IMPROVE THIS FEATURE I HAVE ALREADY COMPLAINED TO THE DEALER ABOUT IT
WOULD LIKE HEADS UP DISPLAY AS AN OPTION
FORWARD POSTS ARE LARGE AND RESTRICT VISIBILITY SIDE VIEWING IS MARGINAL AND REAR WINDOW IS SMALLER THAN OTHER COMPARABLE SUVS
I PREVIOUSLY OWNED AN INFINITI M35X THAT HAD A MUCH LARGER REAR VIEW MIRROR THAN THE CADILLAC AND I PREFER THE INFINITI MIRROR RATHER THAN THE CADILLAC I THINK CADILLAC S MIRROR SHOULD BE LARGER ALSO THE INFINITI HAD TWO FRONT DRIVER SUN VISORS
WITH REGARDS TO THE CHILD VIEW MIRROR WHILE AN EXCELLENT IDEA THE MIRROR ITSELF IS DISTORTED AND DIFFICULT TO SEE CLEARLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE BACK SEAT ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF VEHICLE SAFETY I AM PLEASED WITH OVERALL AS A MOTHER OF 2 ELE
I WOULD LIKE THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS TO BE BIGGER
ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS & AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION MAKE IT EASY TO SAFELY DRIVE
ITS A LARGER VEHICLE BUT THE BACK UP CAMERA REALLY DOES HELP
GETTING USED TO BACK UP CAMERA IT IS DECEPTIVE
VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN AND I HAVE OWNED OVER 25 CARS
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING FORM SIDE TO SIDE BUT I M NOT SURE HOW TO AVOID THAT ISSUE
THE TWO REAR WINDOWS DONT REALLY HELP MUCH CHANGING LANES BUT IS STILL EASY TO CHECK BLIND SPOTS OUT OF FRONT SIDE WINDOWS
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS EXTREMALY POOR THEREFORE HAZARDOUS WHIS THESE TYPE OF MODELS IT IS NECESARY A REAR BACKUP CAMERA FABRIC INSTALLED
VISIBILITY IS TERRIBLE BARELY GOOD ENOUGH TO LIVE WITH IT REQUIRES AN EXTRA EFFORT TO PRECISELY PLACE THE CAR IN A LANE ON SOME OF THE TIGHTER HIGHWAYS IN NEW YORK CITY CHANGING LANES WHILE NOT A BIG ISSUE DOES REQUIRE A LITTLE EXTRA ATTENTIO
GREAT SAFETY RATINGS
DRIVING SAFETY IN SNOWY ICY CONDITION IS NOT EXISTENT IMPOSSIBLE TO DRIVE CAR SLIDES ALL OVER THE ROAD
FRONT WIPER SPRAY IS DIRECTED TO LOW NOT ALLOWING FLUID TO MID UPPER AREAS OF WINDOW REAR WIPER DIFFICULT TO ACCESS TO CLEAN SNOW AND ICE FROM AND DOES NOT SELF CLEAN WELL AT ALL
ADDED BONUS OF THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
WHEN TOP UP REAR VISIBILTY POR
IT COULD USE A BACK UP CAMERA BECAUSE BACKING UP IS A CHALLENGE IN A CAMARO
IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE IN FRONT OF THE CAR AND SOMETIMES JUDGING RIGHT TURN ALSO BAD BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT REAR SIDE
CLEAR VISIBILITY
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS IN CAR
IT S JUST HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE AND SOME BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOTS ARE REALLY BLIND I THINK TWICE BEFORE CHANGING LANES MIRRORS ARE BETTER THAN THE USUAL CAR BUT THERE IS A VERY SMALL AREA WHERE YOU CAN T SEE SOMETIMES
FRONT WIPERS DO HAVE AN ISSUE WHEN DRIVING IN SNOW THE WIPER REST AREA ARE SO FAR BELOW THE DEFROSTER THE WIPER BLADES FREEZE QUICKLY AND DO NOT CLEAR THE WINDSHIELD RECENT BAD WEATHER I HAD TO PULL OVER AND BEAT THE ICE OFF SEVERAL TIMES IN A 4
PRETTY VISIBLE AND SAFE WHEN DRIVING
THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS BUT YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR MIRRORS MY LAST TWO CARS WERE SPORTY CARS WITH LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS AND YOU HAVE TO USE YOUR MIRRORS IT S THAT SIMPLE
DOOR POSTS TOO LARGE BLIND SPOTS AT CORNERS AND PARKING LOTS FOCUSED HEADLIGHTS DO NOT ILLUMINATE OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE HARD TO SEE OFF TO THE SIDE IN DARK AREAS OR WHEN MANEUVERING IN A POORLY LIT PARKING LOTS OR STREETS UNLESS I SWI
HORRIBLE BLIND SPOT WHEN PULLING OUT OF DIAGONAL PARKING
I LIKE THE WAY THE REAR HEADRESTS FOLD DOWN FOR VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY IS THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR STYLING
IT IS VERY EASY TO SEE BLIND SPOTS
DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS IN BLIND SPOTS BLIND SPOT SENSORS SHOULD BE MANDATORY ON A CAR WITH THIS PROFILE
ALL CORVETTES SHOULD HAVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
GREAT LIGHT SYSTEM AND FOG LIGHTS
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE CRASH TEST DATA SAFETY IS A VERY BIG FACTOR FOR ME
WHEN MY CONVERTIBLE TOP IS UP IT IS HARD TO SEE BEHIND ME FROM THE INTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR
YOU HAVE TO REALLY CHECK YOU OBLIQUE BLIND SPOTS JUST OFF READ SIDE BECAUSE REAR WINDOWS ARE SMALLER THEN FRONT SIDE WINDOWS AND FRONT SEAT SITS HIGH TO SUPPORT YOU SO REALLY LOOK OVER SHOULDER TO MAKE SURE SOMEONE IS NOT SITTING OFF YOUR QUARTER
A VEHICLE OF THIS COST SHOULD HAVE LANE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM AND SHOULD HAVE FRONT SENSORS TO TELL YOU WHEN PARKING IF YOU ARE GETTING TOO CLOSE TO A CURB ETC VERY HARD TO JUDGE THE AREA OVER THE HOOD
WHEN PARKING PULLING STRAIGHT IN SPOT CAN NOT SEE MIGHT DAMAGE FRONT END NEEDS SOME KIND OF FEELERS OR CAMERA
FOR OUTSIDE VISIBILITY ESSENTIAL TO HAVE MIRRORS SET CORRECTLY MY MEMORY SEATING SETTING SEEMS TO HAVE TOO MUCH FLEXIBILITY IN SETTING OF PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR
REAR VISIBILITY IS MARGINAL WHEN TOP IS UP OTHERWISE EXCELLENT VISIBILITY WHEN TOP IS DOWN
I WISH IT HAD THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SIGNAL ON THE MIRRORS
VEHICLE HAS VERY BAD BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES NO BLIND SPOT WARNING INDICATORS
I WOULD LIKE BLIND SPOT DETECTORS ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
THE VEHICLE HAS FEW BLIND SPOTS IT IS VERY EASY TO SEE CARS DRIVING NEXT TO YOU
BLIND SPOTS ARE A REAL PROBLEM
SOME BLIND SPOTS LOOKING OVER SHOULDER CHANGING LANES NOT THAT BAD
BLINDS SPOTS AR REAR SIDES
MUST ADD BLIND SPOT SYSTEM FOR ALL TRIMS OF THE CAMARO NOT JUST THE REALLY EXPENSIVE ONES INCLUDE IT IN THE BACK UP CAMERA SYSTEM THE SUN VISORS ARE USELESS WHEN TURNED TO THE SIDE BECAUSE THEY ARE SO SMALL THE NEED TO SLIDE AND BE BIGGER FROM
I HAVE HAD THREE OTHER GM VEHICLES WITH LANE DEPARTURE AND BLIND SPOT WARNING THAT WORKED VERY WELL IF ANY CAR NEED THESE FEATURES IT S THE CAMARO I HOPE THEY ADD THAT FEATURE ON FUTURE CAMARO THE SUN VISOR IN MY CONVERTIBLE IS A JOKE OTHER TH
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES LIKE THE WAY YOU CAN SEE FORWARD
VISIBILITY OVER HOOD DIFFICULT READ HEAD RESTS HAD TO BE REMOVED FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
DOOR POST CREATES A BLINDSPOT
VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING IS LOW BUT THAT S EXPECTED THE REARVIEW CAMERA IS USEFUL
MANDATORY SENSORS ON ALL SIDES THIS IS STANDARD ON CADILLAC SRX AND SHOULD BE ON THIS VEHICLE ALSO THE SIDE REAR BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES ARE TRULY AWFUL
THE CAR HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY WHEN CHANGING LANES BLIND SPOT MONITORING WOULD BE A WELCOME ADDITION TO THIS VEHICLE
ADD A BLIND SPOT MIRROR PANEL TO THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
PLEASE ADJUST THE HIGHT TRAVEL ON THE DRIVERS POWER SEAT SO SHORTER PEOPLE LIKE ME 5 7 SIT UP HIGHER TO GIVE US BETTER FORWARD VISBILITY
I FEEL THAT THE VEHICLE IS VERY SAFE AND AM HAPPY WITH THE NUMBER OF AIR BAGS AND THE OVERALL CONSTRUCTION OF THE VEHICLE
THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE SIDE AND REAR WINDOWS IS PRETTY BAD BUT THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A SPORTS CAR
THE VISIBILITY IN THIS VEHICLE IS MUCH REDUCED FROM THE FORD ESCAPE I DROVE FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS VISIBILITY MAY BE IMPROVED BY INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE BACK WINDOWS AND REDUCING THE SIZE OF THE BULKY FRAME
WE THINK THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE OUTSTANDING REALLY ENJOY THE REAR CAMERA COMES IN HANDY
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THAT REQUIRES A DOUBLE CHECK IN THE MIRRORS BEFORE CHANGING LANES
I REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT FEATURE AS I HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF NEAR MISSES WHEN SWITCHING LANES CARS THAT ARE GOING WAY OVER THE SPEED LIMIT WERE NOT THERE THEN ALL OF THE SUDDEN THEY WERE ALMOST NEXT TO ME IT IS A GREAT SAFETY FEATURE I HAVE ON
FOUR POSTS ARE RATHER CUMBERSOME AND DO DETRACT FROM VISIBILITY ISSUES IN THE CAR
I WISH THE FRAME OF THE VEHICLE ALONG THE WINDSHIELD WOULD BE A BIT NARROWER TO HELP WITH THE BLINDSPOT WHEN LOOKING OUT AND TO THE SIDE
I M NOT FINDING AN PROBLEM WITH BLIND SPOTS PLUS THE BACK UP AND COLLISION FEATURE ARE A GREAT HELP LOVE THEM ONE OF MY REQUIREMENTS WHEN LEASING THIS CAR
I THINK ALL MODELS AND MINE IS THE BASE MODEL OUGHT TO COME WITH BACK UP CAMERA TO GET THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD CAR PAYMENTS I COULDN T AFFORD I DON T THINK THAT SAFETY IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO HAVE NEXT STEP UP WOULD
WE HAVE PUT SMALL CONVEX MIRRORS ON THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS SO I CAN SEE CARS TO THE SIDE OF ME ALSO HELPS WITH CARS BEHIND ME
THERE S A BLIND SPOT LOOKING BACK TOWARDS THE REAR ANGLE CORNER CHANGING LANE HAS BEEN HAZARDOUS
DIFFICULT CHECKING BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT WHEN CHANGING LANES
HAVE A BLIND SPOT WARNING
I WISH THE REAR WINDOW HAD A WINDSHIELD WIPER
THERE IS TO MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO BACK UP
CHEVROLET HAS A PROBLEM WITH LARGE BLIND SPOTS ON THEIR SUV S MAYBE ALL SUV S HAVE THE PROBLEM
OLD FASHIONED DRIVER AND TURN HEAD TO CHECK BLIND SPOTS LOOKING OUT THE REAR WINDOW NEW CAR AND HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING A CLEAR SHOT FAST
THE VIEW FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS SMALL
DIFFICULT TO SEE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
REAR CAMERA IS GREAT FOR BACKING UP HOOD ORNAMENT WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE ABILITY TO JUDGE THE FRONT OF THE CAR
VISUAL LINE OF SIGHT IS POOR BUT ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS HELP DRAMATICALLY
IF I HAD A NEWBORN I WOULD FEEL SAFE AND VERY CONFIDENT OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY OF THIS CAR
I AM VERY COMFORTABLE CHANGING LANES BECAUSE OF THE WARNING SYSTEMS
WHILE REAR VIEW FROM DRIVERS SEAT IS LIMITED DUE TO SIZE OF THE WINDOW THIS HAS NOT YET POSED A PROBLEM AND THE ADAS DEFINITELY PROVIDES COMFORT LEVEL WITH THE RESTRICTED VISIBILITY
REAR CAMERA SOMETIMES FOGS AND IS UNCLEAR
DEFOG A LARGER AREA ON THE REAR WINDOW MAKE HEATED MIRRORS STANDARD ON ALL TRIM LEVELS ABOVE THE BASE LEVEL SLIGHTLY BIGGER OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
WENT FROM AN SUV TO A CAR SO VISIBILITY IS MUCH LOWER
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SUN VISOR EXTENDERS PUT IN FOR BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER VISORS
REALLY LIKE REAR VIEW CAMERA
SUN VISOR NEEDS TO HAVE THE PULL OUT TO EXTEND THE AREA COVERED VISIBILITY ON LEFT SIDE IS POOR
HAS SMALL ROUND MIRROR ON DRIVERS SIDE TO SEE IN BLIND SPOT NEEDS TO BE BIGGER
NOT ENOUGH VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD OVER THE CAR HOOD
BLIND SPOTS ARE BAD
THE BLIND SPOT IS VERY BAD IN THIS VEHICLE I HAVE ALMOST HAD SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BECAUSE I CANNOT SEE ANOTHER CAR ALONG SIDE OF THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE LANES BAD BLIND SPOT
MY SILVERADO HAD RAIN SENSING WIPERS I LIKED THAT FEATURE AND WISH I THEY WERE OFFERED ON THIS TRUCK
WANTED HID HEADLIGHTS
MIRRORS CREATE BLIND SPOTS TOUGH TO LOOK OVER DRIVER SHOULDER WHEN CHANGING INTO LEFT LANE ALSO THE LINES OF THE TRUCK ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT MAKE IT HARD TO GET CLOSE TO OBJECTS WHEN PARKING OR IN TIGHT SPACES
I FELL EXTREMELY SAFE OPERATING THE VEHICLE SEATING IS HIGH AND VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT
LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA AND HOOKING UP TRAILER BY MYSELF
GREAT OUTSIDE MIRRORS AND VISABILITY
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS IN THE FRONT CORNERS OF THE WINDSHIELD WHERE THE ROOF SUPPORTS COME DOWN
VISIBILITY IS NOT SO GOOD AROUND THE A PILLARS NICE BRAKES AND THE CAR FEELS VERY SOLID I LIKE THE SIZE AND WEIGHT OF THIS CAR
HAS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT ELECTRONIC AIDS HELP
BLIND SPOT DETECTION NEEDS TO BE ACTIVATED ABOVE 15 MPH NOT 30 MPH
BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT A LITTLE HARD TO SEE
NAVIGATION PANEL LIGHTING TOO DIM ND NOT VIVID ENOUGH
WANTED BLIND SPOT WARNING BUT N A ON CAR PURCHASED SPECIAL PRICE DEAL COULD NOT ORDER SELECT MODEL WITH ITEM BUT WANTED IT
SINCE I CANNOT SEE THE FRONT OF THE CAR WHEN DRIVING I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PULL UP TO THE CURB OR PULL INTO A PARKING SPACE WITHOUT HITTING THE CONCRETE BUMP WHEN PULLING UP TO A CURB I DO NOT WANT TO HIT THE CURB WITH MY TIRE BUT SINCE I
REAR VISION SHOULD BE IMPROVED
BLIND SPOT WARNING IS NICE BUT ADDING BUILT IN BLIND SPOT MIRRORS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER I ADDED 1 AND 1 2 INCH ROUND ROTATING BLIND SPOT MIRRORS TO MY LACROSSE TO FURTHER IMPROVE THE VISIBILITY OF VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT ALSO THESE ADDED MI
I NOTICE A LARGE BLIND SPOT ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE OF VEHICLE
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS IMPAIRED AND ITS DIFFICULT TO SEE LOWER OBJECTS IN THE FRONT
HUD IS GOOD
LARGE DRIVER LEFT BLINDSPOT
THE COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM REAR CAMERA LANE CHANGING ALERT AND BLIND SPOT ALERT ARE ALL FANTASTIC FEATURES THAT MAKE THE VEHICLE OUTSTANDING
I TEST DROVE MANY EQUAL SIZED VEHICLES AND FOUND THE VISIBILITY OF THE BUICK REGAL WAS THE BEST THAT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I CHOSE THIS VEHICLE TO LEASE
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE BACK WIND THE ELECTRONIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT IS GOOD AND ESPECIALLY LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA
BLIND SPOTS FROM RIGHT AND LEFT ROOF SUPPORTS
I LOVE THE LANE CHANGE WARNING IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK IS NOT GOOD SO REAR CAMERA IS ESSENTIAL I WISH THERE WAS A SENSOR FOR THE FRONT WHEN PARKING VERY HARD TO TELL HOW CLOSE YOU ARE I OFTEN HAVE TO GET OUT AND CHECK
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT SENSOR AND THE DRIVER CONFIDENCE PACKAGE  1 IN GENERAL
BIGGEST CONCERN WITH SAFETY OF VEHICLE IS REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT MEANING WHEN THE DRIVER LOOKS BACK ON THE DRIVER S SIDE THE VISIBILITY IS HORRIBLE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE IN PLACE BECAUSE THE DRIVER CANNOT SEE WELL TRAF
I HAVE NOTICED THAT THE LOCATION AND SIZE OF THE SIDE MIRRORS ALONG WITH THE ROOF PILLARS CREATE A BLIND SPOT SINCE THEY ARE SO CLOSE TOGETHER
DRIVER SIDE SUN VISOR DOES NOT COVER ENTIRE SIDE WINDOW WHEN DRIVING NEEDS EXTENSION TO COVER 6 INCH GAP TO END OF SIDE WINDOW VERY ANNOYING WHEN SUN IS ON DRIVER SIDE OF VEHICLE WHEN DRIVING
I HAD THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS FOLDED DOWN AS THEY OBSTRUCTED BACK VISION GREATLY I FOUND I HAD A SERIOUS BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT SO FAR I HAVE COMPENSATED FOR THIS WITH MIRRORS AND DRIVING A LITTLE SLOWER
THE VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING IS POOR BECAUSE OF THE WIDE SIDE AREAS TO THE SIDES OF THE WINDSHIELD I AM USED TO A GREATER AMOUNT OF FORWARD SIDE VISIBILITY
REAR CAMERA ON THIS CAR IS NEEDED DUE TO POOR REAR VISIBILITY
I FEEL VERY SAFE ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE SIDE WARNING FEATURES THE REARVIEW CAMERA AND FRANKLY THE HEATED OUTSIDE MIRRORS
FEEL BLIND SPOTS IN REAR SIDE VISION
I HAVE SOME TROUBLE WITH REAR VISIBILITY BUT THE BACK UP CAMERA COMPENSATES FOR MOST OF MY PROBLEM
THE REAR WINDOW WIPER SWIPES TOO SMALL AN AREA
SOME BLIND SPOTS THAT TAKE GETTING USED TO WHEN CHANGING LANES
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF BLIND SPOTS ON THE REAR SIDES WHEN CHANGING LANES HOWEVER WITH THE SIDE LANE INDICATORS IT REDUCES RISK OF OTHER VEHICLES IN THESE BLIND SPOTS
LOVE ALL THE SAFETY FEATURES
FRONT POSTS BLOCK VISIBILITY
FEEL AS IF I HAVE A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OFF TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS IF THE FRAME IS A BIT TOO WIDE BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE SIDE WINDOWS
WITH THE ADDITION SAFETY PACKAGE LANE CHANGE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR WORKS GREAT COLLISION ALERT SOMETIMES GOES OFF WITH NO TRAFFIC
SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING UP AT THE REAR DOORS
FOR SOME REASON IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO SEE IF THERE IS A CAR IMMEDIATELY NEXT TO MY PASSENGER REAR DOOR ESPECIALLY IF IT IS A CAR THAT IS SHORTER THAN MINE I JUST THINK THE TRUCK SHOULD COME EQUIP WITH ONE OF THOSE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON B
WHEN BACKING UP REAR VISIBILITY NEEDS IMPROVING HAS MANY BLIND SPOTS
AWESOME VISIBILITY OUT OF THE VEHICLE
PRETTY BAD BLIND SPOT ON REAR PASSENGER SIDE AND DRIVER SIDE ISN T THE GREATEST EITHER
DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW THE BACK UP CAMERA DOES HELP
LARGE BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE WITHOUT MY TURNING MY HEAD TO AN UNCOMFORTABLE LIMIT ALSO TAKING MY EYES OFF THE ROAD IN FRONT FOR TO LONG A PERIOD I HAD OTHER PREVIOUS OWNERS TELL ME THIS AFTER I
SHOULD HAVE SIDE VIEWS MIRRORS WITH BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ONES WE BUY COME OF IN EXTREME COLD LIKE TODAY 25 COULD BE BUILIT IN
THERE IS SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS FOR CHECKING REAR VIEW FROM THE DRIVING POSITION
I MISS THE BLIND SPOT SECTION OF MY OUTSIDE MIRRORS I HAD IT ON MY LAST TRAVERSE
REAR BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY ROUGH
BLIND SPOTS TAKE GETTING USE TO
THE VARIOUS SAFETY FEATURES ARE NICE TO HAVE
THE HIGH SMALL SIDE WINDOWS AND FRONT SIDE AIRBAGS REDUCE VISIBILITY
W O THE BACK UP CAMERA IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW
OVERALL THERE JUST SEEM TO BE A FEW TOO MANY LARGE BLIND SPOTS BUT I GUESS THAT S WHERE ALL THOSE AIRBAGS ARE I LIKE AND IT ONLY INTERFERES ON OCCASION BUT IT S DISCONCERTING WHEN A PORTION OF THE ROAD DISAPPEARS AS YOUR ROUND A BEND
BLIND SPOT WHERE FRONT WINDSHIELD MEETS SIDE WINDOW IS TO LARGE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY IS SMALL BUT UNDERSTANDABLE FOR SHAPE OF CAR
VISIBILITY IS NOT VERY GOOD THE FRONT COLUMN BETWEEN FRONT WINDSHIELD AND DRIVER WINDOW CREATES A LARGE BLIND SPOT AND I VE NOT SEEN TWO PEOPLE CROSSING AT A CROSSWALK BECAUSE OF IT
NEEDS REAR WINDOW WIPER
IT S AWFUL SEEING OUT THE BACK THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL AND THE REAR VISIBILITY IS ATROCIOUS I HAVE TO MOVE AROUND TO SEE IF I CAN CHANGE LANES
SPLIT BACK WINDOW TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO VISIBILITY FOR LANE CHANGING NOT GREAT
BLIND SPOTS BIGGER THAN OUR OLD SUBURBAN
DRIVER S SIDE COLUMN VERY BIG CUTS VISIBILITY
REAR VIEW MIRROR VISIBILITY IS LIMITED EXTERNAL MIRRORS ARE AMPLY SIZED
HARD TO SEE OUT MANY BLIND SPOTS
REALLY LIKE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
REAR VIS IS POOR BUT A PILLARS BLOCK A GREAT DEAL OF VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING
THERE ARE MANY BLIND SPOTS IN THE CAR WISH I HAD THE DEVICE THAT TELLS ME SOMEONE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT SHOULD BE STANDARD
BLIND SPOTS SEEM TO BE LARGER HARDER TO JUDGE
IT S ESSENTIAL TO HAVE A REAR VIEW CAM WHEN BACKING UP THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT NOT JUST AN OPTION
GREAT SAFETY FEATURES WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT THE BEST PERFORMING
FORWARD ROOF STRUTS ARE TOO WIDE THEY OBSCURE FORWARD QUARTER VISIBILITY
THE SAFETY OF VEHICLE WAS ANOTHER KEY FACTOR IN PURCHASE DECISION
IT REALLY NEEDS A REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER
DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF VEHICLE SO I HAVE TO TRUST THE BACKUP CAMERA
IMAGE QUALITY OF REAR CAMERA IS GRAINY AND POOR I HAVE IT TURNED ON BUT I DON T RELY ON IT
THE BLIND SPOT IS VERY BAD
HAVING A FRONT CAMERA VIEW AS WELL AS THE REAR
THE FRONT PILLARS ARE SLOPED IN A WAY THAT FAVORS AERODYNAMICS BUT OBSTRUCTS SOME VISIBILITY THIS IS EVEN MORE TRUE FOR THE REAR PILLARS WHICH ARE THICK AND HEAVILY OBSCURE THE REAR QUARTER VIEW
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR ESPECIALLY FOR TALL DRIVERS
I FEEL MORE ACTIVE WHEN CHECKING BLIND SPOTS RATHER THAN LOOKING AT SIDE MIRRORS YOU HAVE TO TURN YOUR HEAD AND SHIFT YOUR BODY IN SOME SITUATIONS
BEST IS BACK UP CAMERA
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE OF THE VEHICLE IN ADDITION VEHICLE SIDE WARNING SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE
INSTANTANEOUS ELECTRIC POWER TO THE WHEELS WITH PERFECT TRACTION CONTROL GIVES SUPERB CONTROL IN DIFFICULT TRAFFIC COMBINED WITH THE FORWARD RADAR MAKES IT THE SAFEST FEELING CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN
VISIBILITY TERRIBLE MANY BLIND SPOTS
I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT WHAT IS BEHIND ME BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES AND TURNING
DIFFICULT TO CLEAN BOTTOM OF REAR WINDOW NO SPACE HIGH BELT LINE AND LOWER ROOF MAKE FOR LIMITED VISIBILITY AND HARD TO ENTER WITHOUT HITTING HEAD ON THE LOW ROOF
THE REARVIEW MIRROR CREATES A MASSIVE BLINDSPOT FOR THE DRIVER I M NOT TALL ONLY 6 EVEN BUT I HAVE TO DUCK MY HEAD OR MOVE TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT TO SEE CARS THAT WOULD BE APPROACHING AT 90 DEGREES TO MY RIGHT WHEN CLOSING ON AN INTERSECTION
THE BACK GLASS IS SMALL AND THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE SMALL CREATING BLIND SPOTS I WOULD NOT OWN THIS VEHICLE WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT ASSIST SYSTEM WISH WORKS GREAT
FORWARD AND FORWARD ANGLE VISIBILITY IS POOR THE FRAME BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND DOOR WINDOWS A PILLAR IS VERY THICK AND OFTEN BLOCKS LARGE CRITICAL AREAS WHEN MAKING TURNS PEDESTRIANS WATCH OUT THE ENORMOUS SENSOR BLOCK BEHIND THE REA
REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS RESTRICTED BY CAR S FRAME
DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS IN BLIND SPOT
HEADREST ON THE REAR 3RD ROW CAUSE DIFFICULTY SEEING OUT THE SIDE BACK WINDOW FOR CARS IN THE BLIND SPOT BOTH ROWS OF HEADRESTS OBLITERATE THE REAR WINDOW PARTIALLY
THERE S A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT DRIVER SIDE
CAN T SEE OUT REAR WINDOW WHEN MOVIE SCREEN IS DOWN
JUST WOULD LIKE AUTO HEADLIGHTS
A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS THAT YOU NEED TO LEARN TO NAVIGATE I CAME FROM AN SUV WITH NO BLIND SPOTS TO A CAR WITH BLIND SPOTS AND ITS TAKEN SOME BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION TO GET USED TO A CAR AGAIN
CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW FOR ME ALSO AT TIMES CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT BACK BUT THE CAMERA WORKS GREAT
I FEEL THERE IS A SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN AVERAGE BLIND SPOT LR
HEADLIGHTS BEST WITH FOG LIGHTS ON LOVE THE MINI OPERA WINDOWS SIDES BACK
DIFFICULTY SEEING WHILE NIGHT DRIVING DUE TO NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH HEADLIGHTS
MORE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES I LOOK TWO TIMES QUITE OFTEN
NEED LARGER OR LONGER SUN VISORS
HAS BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
VERY BAD BLIND SPOT OVER THE DRIVERS RIGHT BACK SIDE
ADDING A BLIND SPOT MIRROR WOULD BE NICE
I AM USED TO DRIVING SUVS THIS IS MY VERY FIRST CAR THAT ISN T AND SUV SO THERE IS SOME CHALLENGE IN SEEING THE BLIND SPOT ON THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE DUE TO THE SMALL REAR WINDOW BUT OVERALL IT S GOT GREAT VISIBILITY I CHOSE THIS CAR BECAUSE I
LOVE THE ARROWS IN THE MIRRORS FOR BLINDSPOT LIKE ANY SPORTSCAR THOUGH LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER TO CHANGE LANES IS TRICKY DUE TO REAR WINDOW SIZE OVERALL THINGS ARE OK
VISIBILITY CAN BE TOUGH WITH BLIND SPOTS THE LANE CHANGE WARNING COMES IN HANDY TO MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM
A BAD BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES THANKFULLY I HAVE THE LANE DEPARTURE SYSTEM
YOU CANNOT TELL WHERE THE FRONT OF THE CAR IS WHEN PARKING IT HAS A REALLY LOW FRONT SPOILER THAT WILL HIT PARKING CURBS CAR NEEDS A FRONT VIEW CAMERA FOR PARKING
VEHICLE VISIBILITY DIFFICULT BUT MUCH IMPROVED BY BLIND SPOT MONITORING
ALL AROUND VISIBILITY IS JUST OK TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO THE REAR CAMERA DEFINITELY HELPS
I REALLY LIKE THE VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD AHEAD
I HAVE SLX PACKAGE WHY INSTALL INTERIOR AUTOMATED REAR VIEW MIRROR ISN T THE MANUAL MIRROR GOOD ENOUGH
GREAT VISIBILITY FOR A VECHILE WITH 3 ROWS OF SEATING GREAT SIZE DRIVE PASSENGER MIRRORS THE INTERIOR PANORAMIC MIRROR IS A NICE TOUCH
THE DODGE CHALLENGER HAS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF BLIND SPOTS AND IS ALSO VERY EASY TO SEE OUT OF COMPARED TO MUSTANGS OTHER CARS LIKE SO
LOTS OF VISIBILITY
BIG BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDE BUT IM SURE YOU KNOW THAT ALREADY
BLIND SPOTS ARE HORRIBLE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SHOULD COME STANDARD IN THESE CARS DUE TO VISIBILITY
THE BLIND SPOT CENSORS ARE A GOD S SEND
DESIGN IS EXCEPTIONAL BUT REAR VISION SUFFERS THANK GOODNESS FOR REAR CAMERA
CLEAR ISSUE WITH BLINDSPOT WHEN DRIVER LOOKS OVER RIGHT SHOULDER TO SEE ANY TRAFFIC TO THE RIGHT THE BACKUP CAMERA DOES HELP MITIGATE THIS ISSUE WHEN BACKING UP
THERE S A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN A VEHICLE IS DRIVING NEXT TO ME NOT PICKED UP BY THE SIDE MIRROR
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW BLIND SPOTS IN THIS VEHICLE TOOK A WHILE TO GET USED TO
THERE IS A RIGHT SIDE BLIND SPOT
SIDE BLIND SPOTS CAN BE OF CONCERN
SMALL BACK WINDOWS MAKE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE CAR HAS SOME BLIND SPOTS THE HEADLIGHTS ON BRIGHT ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH
THE CAR FEELS STURDY AND SAFE WHEN DRIVING AND VISIBILITY IS GOOD
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN BACKING UP VISIBILITY IS TERRIBLE
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT AND THE BACK SEATS HEADREST ARE IN WAY OF SEEING BUT I AM GETTING USE TO IT BETTER THAN AT FIRST
I WISH ALL MODELS CAME STANDARD WITH REAR VIEW CAMERA MINE DOES NOT
VEHICLE HAS BLIND SPOT IN FRONT OF VEHICLE ALONG SIDES OF WINDSHIELD WHICH MAKES SEEING PEDESTRIANS DIFFICULT
LIKE THE OVERALL NUMBER OF AIRBAGS SAFE FEELING
MENTIONED IT BEFORE BUT THERE IS A SERIOUS BLIND SPOT MAYBE FOR FUTURE DESIGNS INCLUDE THE SMALLER MIRROR INSIDE THE BIGGER SIDE MIRROR TO HELP AIDE IN CHANGING LANES WHEN SOMEONE IS RIDING IN YOUR BLIND SPOT OTHER THAN THAT I REALLY LOVE THIS
I REALLY LIKE THE ACTIVE SAFETY FEATURES LIKE FORWARD COLLISION WARNING WITH BRAKING AND THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING
BAD BLIND SPOT SUN VISOR IS TO SHORT
I HAVE GREAT VISABILITY FROM MY DURANGO
SUN REFLECTS OFF OF DASHBOARD IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE THE BLIND SPOTS THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT SHOWING THE ROAD WELL IN POOR VISIBILITY
DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE AND PROPER KNOWLEDGE OF ADJUSTING MIRRORS EVERYTHING IS EASILY VISIBLE AND SAFELY DRIVABLE
SIDE MIRRORS NEED TO COME WITH BUILT IN FISH EYES TO HELP WITH THE BLIND SPOT
THE SUN VISORS ARE TOO SMALL IN BOTH DIMENSIONS WOULD LIKE A SLIDE OUT FEATURE TO MAKE THEM WIDER OR LONGER IF NEEDED RIGHT REAR UPPER PANEL IS LARGE REDUCING VISIBILITY OF RIGHT SIDE TRAFFIC I DEPEND A LOT ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS BUT
THERE IS A MAJOR BLIND SPOT ON LEFT DRIVER SIDE IN FRONT
BLIND SPOT N OUTSIDE MIRRORS HAD TO BUY SMALL ROUND MIRRORS AND INSTALL ON FACTORY MIRRORS FOR VIEWING ONCOMING TRAFFIC BEHIND
THERE NEEDS TO BE A REAR CAMERA INSTALLED IN ALL THE VEHICLES
GREAT VISIBILITY AND SAFETY FOR THIS SIZE CAR
FEELING OF BLINDSPOT ON CORNERING DUE TO SIDEVIEW MIRROR PLACEMENT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO
THE VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD
HAS AN EXTRA REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT IS BUILT IN TO THE GLASSES STORAGE AND IS CURVED AND HELPS SEE IN BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOT SYSTEM NOT OFFERED AS OPTION
I NEED THE REAR VIEW CAMERA TO HELP ME BAG BACK WHILE TRYING TO REVERSE OUT OF PARKING SPACES I THINK ALL THE VEHICLES SHOULD HAVE HAD REAR VIEW CAMERAS TO HELP THEM SEE BEHIND THEM THIS IS A VERY LONG SUV AND THE 3RD ROW SEAT HEADS REST DOESN T
THE A PILLARS GET IN THE WAY OF FORWARD ANGLE SIGHT LINES AND THE REAR VIEW AREA IS EXTREMELY LIMITED A GOOD THING THAT THE BACK UP CAMERA IS THERE
ITS A TRUCK I HAVE NEVER OWNED ONE BEFORE LOOKING BEHIND A TRUCK IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM A CAR JUST NEED TO CONTINUE TO GET BETTER BACK UP CAMERA AND SENSORS ARE VERY HELPFUL
I ORDERED THE TOW MIRRORS AND LIKE THEM BETTER THAN STANDARD
THE ONLY THING I WOULD SAY IS THE BLIND SPOT FROM THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BUT I AM 6 2 TALL SO I HAVE TO BEND DOWN TO SEE TRAFFIC AT A 4 WAY STOP
TRULY APPRECIATE BACK UP CAMERA AS WELL AS BED CAMERA WHICH IS EXTREMELY HELPFUL WHEN HOOKING UP TO GOOSENECK TRAILER BY YOURSELF
OUTSIDE MIRRORS ARE VERY BIG THAT IS MAYBE A GOOD AND BAD THING CREATES SOMEWHAT OF A BLINDSPOT
REAR VIEW MIRRORS TOO LARGE AND SIDE WINDSHIELD SUPPORTS BLOC VIEW OF ON COMING CARS WHEN ENTERING A ROAD FROM A PARKING LOT
I CAN T SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW USING THE REARVIEW MIRROR VERY WELL I AM ONLY ABLE TO SEE A COUPLE YARDS BEHIND THE VEHICLE IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE VERY FAR OUT OF IT ALSO THE BLIND SPOT IS HUGE IN MY OPINION AND I M NEVER QUITE SURE HOW SAF
THERE IS A FEW BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING BACK TO SWITCH LANES
SIDE MIRRORS ARE NOT GREAT FOR VISIBILITY
MINIMAL BLIND SPOTS THERE IS GREAT VISIBILITY ALL AROUND
LARGE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A GREAT FEATURE AND MAKE THE TRUCK EASIER TO PARK
OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE TAKING A LONG TIME TO GET USED TO I MUCH PREFERRED THE MIRRORS ON MY 2003 DODGE RAM THAT ALSO HAD THE FLIP UP TOWING MIRRORS
VERY HARD TO GET USED TO THE LARGE SPLIT OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
REALLY BAD BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING UP ON PASSENGER SIDE BACK DOOR COLUMN MAKES SEEING DIFFICULT
LARAMIE PACKAGE SHOULD INCLUDE LANE CHANGING WARNING WHEN CARS PRESENT LIKE MY TOWN AND COUNTRY TOURING L PACKAGE
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF THERE WAS A CAMERA ON THE FRONT OF TRUCK THAT COULD BE USED WHILE TRYING TO PARK THE TRUCK SOMETIMES IT S SLIGHTLY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE IN THE FRONT OF TRUCK TO ANOTHER VEHICLE WHILE PARKING
THE 3500 REAR VIEW MIRRORS WHEN PLACED IN THE STANDARD POSITION HAS A SPOT MIRROR THAT IS HALFWAY BLOCKED BY THE POSITION OF THE REGULAR MIRROR IN ORDER TO HAVE A BETTER VIEW WITH MY SPOT MIRROR I HAVE TO PUT THE MIRRORS INTO THE UPRIGHT POSITI
SINCE IT IS A MEGA CAB IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A CAMERA VIEW OF THE CARGO AREA TO ENSURE EVERYTHING IS SECURE WHEN DRIVING AND HAULING CARGO IN THE BED
I WOULD RECOMMEND REPLACING HEADLIGHTS WITH HID OR LED LIGHTING SYSTEMS
HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS SHOULD ALL HAVE EXTENDED MIRRORS SECONDARY BLIND SPOT MIRRORS AND VEHICLE APPROACHING WARNING STANDARD YOU SHOULD ASSUME HEAVY DUTY TRUCK OWNERS TOW AND NEED DECENT MIRRORS AND SAFETY FEATURES STANDARD
THERE ARE SOME INCREASED BLIND SPOTS BY THE WIDTH OF THE CAR S MEDIAN B T FRONT AND BACK SEATS IN THE FOUR DOOR SEDAN
THE HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY DISAPPOINTING THE CONVENTIONAL LIGHTS ON MY PROVIDED BETTER VISIBILITY
THE BACK END OF THE TRUCK SAT SO HIGH THAT YOU CANT SEE PEOPLE WALKING BEHIND VEHICLE WHEN YOUR NOT IN BACK UP MODE
BACKUP CAMERA GETS DIRTY QUICKLY AND YOU CAN T SEE
THE HOOD COULD BE A LITTLE LOWER IN HEIGHT FOR BETTER FORWARD VISIBILITY
4 00 AND 7 00 BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BAD WHEN BACKING UP
CAN T SEE RIGHT CORNER OF THE FENDER DUE TO HUMP IN THE HOOD
MAKE THE VISORS LARGER OR HAVE EXTENSIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN USED ON THE SIDE MAKE THE MIRRORS LARGER AND MORE SQUARE THE TRIANGLE SHAPE LOOSES EFFECTIVE VISIBILITY THE INTERIOR CENTER MIRROR IS IN THE WAY FOR TALLER PEOPLE IT ALMOST DOESN T ADJU
IN THE LS MODEL THE VISIBILITY CHANGING LANES WAS A BIT MORE INVOLVING AND TOOK LONGER TO BE SAFELY CLEARED TO CHANGE LANES THEN THE 07 COBALT I WAS USE TO ALTHOUGH THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS I PUT ON CLEARED THIS ISSUE UP
I HAVEN T DRIVEN OUT OF THE CITY AT NIGHT YET SO I CANNOT JUDGE THE HEADLIGHTS
GREAT HAVING THE BACKUP CAMERA IN A TRUCK THIS SIZE
LOWER PORTION OF A PILLARS HIDE MUCH OF WHICH IS APPROACHING FROM THE SIDE OF THE VEHICLE BE IT PEDESTRIANS CYCLISTS OR OTHER AUTOS THIS IS SOMETHING I AM AWARE OF AND COMPENSATE FOR I REALIZE THE PILLARS HOUSE AIR BAGS AND ARE DESIGNED
SEEMS TO HAVE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
BARELY ANY REAR VISIBILITY IF THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SCREEN IS DOWN
WHEN THE DVD PLAYER SCREEN IS DOWN & THE THIRD ROW HEAD REST ARE UP IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR MIRROR
THE BLIND SPOT LIGHTS ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE VERY HELPFUL ESPECIALLY IN FREEWAY TRAFFIC
NEED MORE REAR WIPER COVERAGE AREA
I HAVE A PROBLEM WHEN LOOKING TO THE LEFT THROUGH THE A PILLAR IT BLOCKS MY VIEW I AM 6 TALL & SIT BACK IN THE SEAT SO THAT COULD BE THE PROBLEM BUT I NEED TO MOVE AROUND IN THE SEAT TO GET PAST THE BLIND SPOT
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A CAMERA IN THE FRONT BUMPER TO AID IN PARKING THE ULTRASONIC SENSORS ARE GREAT AS FAR AS THEY GO BUT I NEED TO SEE WHERE THE CURB IS SO I DON T BANK THE GRAVEL PAN
VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT LOOKING LEFT THE WINDSHIELD POST SEEMS IN THE WRONG POSITION AND BLOCKS VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING
BACKING UP HARD VISIBILITY BACKING UP TRAILERS MIRRORS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT NEED TO LOWER REAR SEATS JUST TO SEE
BLIND SPOTS REMAIN A BIT DIFFICULT TO MANAGE CAMERAS AND WARNING SYSTEMS IMPROVE SAFETY
THE ATS COUPE HAS A SEVERE RIGHT REAR BLIND SPOT WHEN OBSERVING IF THERE IS ANOTHER VEHICLE IN THE RIGHT LANE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS A MUST ON THIS VEHICLE UNFORTUNATELY I DO NOT HAVE IT ON THIS VEHICLE SO EXTRA CARE MUST BE TAKEN WHEN CHA
WHILE I LOVE THE BIRDS EYE VIEW CAMERAS I D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DISABLE IT ON DEMAND TO GET A LARGER REAR CAMERA VIEW ESPECIALLY WHEN BACKING A TRAILER
ALSO HAVE A STINGRAY AND THE BACKUP DISPLAY CAMERA IS MUCH CLEARER AND SHARPER
WHEN THE KIDS HAVE THE SEAT ROW VIDEO SCREEN DOWN CAN T SEE OUT OF REAR VIEW MIRROR
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS DON T GIVE GOOD VISIBILITY OF VEHICLES TO THE REAR TOO SMALL COMPARED TO EARLIER MODELS
I WISH THE VEHICLE CAME WITH FOG LIGHTS
LANE DEPARTURE AND BLIND SPOT REALLY HELP WHEN DRIVING THIS LARGE TRUCK SUV
VISIBILITY OVER THE DRIVERS SEAT DOOR IS MOSTLY OBSTRUCTED BLOCKED BY THE BACK DOOR JAM WHERE YOU PULL THE SEAT BELT FROM RELY MOSTLY ON MIRROR AND WARNING LIGHT REAR TRUNK WINDOW A LITTLE SMALLER THAN ID LIKE FOR VISIBILTY OVERRALL I FEEL E
REAR VISIBILITY IS QUITE GOOD WITH THE REAR CAMERA IT S TERRIBLE WITHOUT THE CAMERA
THE REAR WINDOW WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE TOO SORT AND ONLY CLEAN BARELY HALF OF THE WINDOW
EVEN THOUGH IT HAS LANE DEPARTURE WARNING A LARGER MIRROR WOULD BE NICE
OVERALL VISIBILITY AND SAFETY WHILE DRIVING IS EXCELLENT I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE
LOVE AUTOMATIC DIMMING HEADLIGHTS & AUTOMATIC WIPPERS
I SEEM TO HAVE SOME ISSUE LOOKING TO THE SIDE AND BACK LIKE PULLING OUT INTO AN INTERSECTION AND CHANGING LANES SOLID AREA BETWEEN BACK AND FRONT SEATS CREATES A BLIND SPOT BUT WARNING SYSTEM IS WONDERFUL AND COMPENSATES FOR THIS ISSUE WHEN JUST
I DO FIND A BLIND SPOT IN THE FRONT
BIG BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE BETWEEN FRONT WINDOW AND SIDE WINDOW
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT ALERT IN SIDE MIRRORS
THE VEHICLE IS DARK INSIDE I FIND A BLIND SPOT WITH THE SIDE FRAME OF THE FRONT WINDOW
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE WHEN I HAVE MY SEAT FORWARD
THE SINGLE ONLY PROBLEM WE VE EXPERIENCED WITH SRX BODY STYLE HAD A SRX ALSO IS THE POOR VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOWS AND PARTICULARLY THE SIDE WINDOWS HAVING PASSING ALERT SYSTEM IS A GREAT HELP AND A MUCH BIGGER REAR CAMERA SCREEN
FORWARD COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM IS ERRATIC SO CANNOT DEPEND ON IT AT ALL
I LIKE THE BLIND SIDE WARNING
BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGE BUT BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM WORKS WELL TO OVERCOME THAT
SAFETY RATINGS  AIRBAGS WERE A BUYING DECISION
BLIND SPOTS ON SIDE REAR
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE CENTER REAR VISION MIRROR HAD THE AUTO DRIVER MEMORY ADJUSTMENT LIKE THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS HAVE
THE SAFEST I HAVE EVER FELT WHEN CHANGING LANES THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE THE BEST YET
A LITTLE HARDER TO SEE REAR VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY FROM THE THIRD ROW SEAT IS MORE OBSTRUCTED IN THIS NEW MODEL COMPARED TO EARLIER MODELS LIKE THE MODEL WE TRADED IN AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE THRID ROW SEAT DESIGN JUST SEEMS TO OBSTRUCT VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER SEEING OUT
DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT REAR PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHECKING FOR BLIND SPOT WITH REAR SEAT IN UP POSITION
BLIND SPOTS ARE AWFUL WHEN BACKING UP AND CHANGING LANES CAN T SEE ANYTHING SMALL BEHIND ME
LOVE THE LIGHT ON SIDE MIRRORS THAT HELP ME WITH BLIND SPOTS
CAN T SEE END OF HOOD ALSO WHEN BACKING OBJECTS IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE GIVE WARNING WHICH IN MY OPINION SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IT IS VERY DISTRACTING WHEN NEAR A CURB TO PUT IT IN REVERSE AND HAVE THE WARNING SYSTEM TELL ME I M ABOUT TO HIT SOME
THE OUTSIDE SIDE MIRRORS AND CORNER BRACE ON THE FRONT SIDE WINDOWS CONSTITUTE A REAL BLIND SPOT THE IS A CURVE JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM OUR HOUSE AND I JUST CANNOT SEE A CAR COMING AROUND IT FROM THE LEFT ALSO IN A SHOPPING CENTER PARKING L
VISIBILITY OUT BACK WINDOW IS LIMITED
IT IS DIFFICULT SEEING OUT OF THE SMALLER REAR SIDE WINDOWS I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT AWARENESS ALERT
IT IS A LARGE VEHICLE BUT VISIBILITY IS PRETTY GOOD
WHEN REAR DVD SCREENS ARE DOWN VISIBILITY IS TERRIBLE PREVIOUS SUBURBAN WAS MUCH BETTER ALSO SIDE MIRRORS SEEM MUCH SMALLER THAN
REARVIEW MIRROR COMPLETELY BLOCKED WHEN MOVIE PLAYER SCREENS IN OPEN POSITION
THE VEHICLE S REAR CAMERA BACK UP AND REAR BACK UP ASSIST ARE ESSENTIAL I HAVE DRIVEN IN RAIN AND ICE AND FELT VERY MUCH IN CONTROL
BLIND SPOT IS FAIRLY LARGE IN REAR CORNERS
VISIBILITY TO THE REAR QUARTERS AND DIRECTLY OUT THE BACK NEEDS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT GM SHOULD BE ABLE TO DESIGN A CAMARO WITH GREAT VISIBILITY AND STILL HAVE THE CAMARO LOOK
THE VEHICLE HAS MAJOR BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING UP
HAS BAD BLIND SPOTS
VISIBILITY IS NOT THIS VEHICLE S STRONG SUIT
LACK OF VISIBILITY MAKES DRIVING THIS AUTO VERY DANGEROUS YOU ALMOST JUST HAVE TO HOPE THERE IS NOTHING THERE ALTHOUGH PROCEEDING WITH CAUTION AND HOPING IF ANYTHING IS APPROACHING THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO STOP WILL STOP
THEY RE ARE A COUPLE OF REALLY BAD BLIND SPOT AT THE REAR AND TO CHANGE LINES BUT THE VEHICLE RESPONDES NICELY
BACKING UP THE CAMERA HELPED BUT YOU HAD LITTLE VIABILITY TO THE PASSENGER SIDE TO SEE SIDE TRAFFIC COMING AT YOU
MUST HAVE THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA OTHERWISE CAN T SEE SAFELY OUT THE REAR
UNDERSTANDABLY THERE HAS TO BE A TRADE OFF BETWEEN VEHICLE STYLING AND DRIVER VISIBILITY
THE SIZE OF BLIND SPOTS IS PARTICULARLY CONCERNING HOWEVER THE STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO MOST OF THE BLIND SPOT ISSUES IS SURELY A COMPROMISE FOR THE OVERALL RIGIDITY OF THE CHASSIS
POOR VISIBILITY THROUGH REAR SEATING WINDOWS
I WISH THE REAR WINDOW WIPER WAS LARGER
SIDE DOOR PILLAR SEEMS TO OBSTRUCT SIDE VISIBILITY MORE THAN NORMAL WHEN AT INTERSECTION
I LIKE THE MIRRORS THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR HAS AN ADDITIONAL MIRROR BLIND SPOT THAT HELPS
I FEEL SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE AND REALLY LIKE THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA STANDARD IN THE COLORADO
NIGHT DRIVING IF NO CAR HEADLIGHTS DIRECTLY BEHIND ME A REFLECTION OF THE HEATING AC CONTROL PANEL IS VISIBLE IN REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE HEADLIGHTS DO NOT ILLUMINATE JUST IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE I HAVE TO ALWAYS DRIVE WITH THE FOG LIGHTS ON IN ADDITION TO THE HEADLIGHTS TO SEE ASPECTS OF THE ROAD THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE FRONT END CURBS ETC
VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT LOOKING TO YOUR RIGHT REAR IS POOR ALWAYS WONDERING IS THERE SOMEONE ON MY RIGHT SIDE AS I CHANGE LANES
THE REAR OF THIS TRUCK SITS ALOT HIGHER THAN THE COLORADO I HAD IT S HARDER TO SEE BEHIND OR THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR CORNER A BLIND SPOT
WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE LEFT IT IS VERY VERY HARD TO DETERMINE IF SOMEONE IS IN THE BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY AND SAFETY FEATURES ARE EXCEPTIONAL
THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS WAS ADJUSTABLE WOULD BE NICE AND A BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE TOO
THE HOOD IS PUFFED UP A BIT WHICH HINDERS VISIBILITY MORE THAN NEED BE
VERY HARD TO SEE IN REAR RIGHT BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES TO RIGHT DRIVER S SIDE SOMEWHAT BETTER
CAB SITS HIGH GOOD VISIBILITY BUT FEELS LIKE IT COULD ROLL OVER EASY Z71 MODEL
GIVEN THE CLASS OF VEHICLE THE CORVETTE FALLS IN THE VISIBILITY IS FAR BETTER THAN I EXPECTED
VISIBILITY IN THE NEW CY CORVETTE IS FAR BETTER THAN THE CURRENT CAMARO I HAVE NO PROBLEMS KNOWING OF AND BEING ABLE TO SEE ANY ALL CARS AROUND ME
VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES COULD BE BETTER
HAS A BIG BLIND SPOT NEEDS LANE CHANGE ASSIST OR SENSORS TO DETECT OTHER VEHICLES IN BLIND SPOT
REAR VISIBILITY WITH THE CONVERTIBLE IS POOR
THE REARWARD VISIBILITY OF THE CAR IS HAMPERED BY LOW SEATING POSITION AND THE HIGH SHOULDERS OF THE REAR END BUT THE SKINNY PEDAL MAKES SURE THAT YOU RE WELL AHEAD OF ANYTHING LURKING IN THE LANE NEXT TO YOU AND THAT S REASSURING
LANE CHANGING VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED
THE REAR CAMERA MAKES PARKING AND BACKING UP VERY CONVENIENT AND EASY
VISIBILITY TO REAR IS NOT PERFECT BUT REAR VIEW CAMERA HELPS A LOT
VISIBILITY WHILE CHANGING LANES IS TERRIBLE I VE ALMOST HIT OTHER CARS MORE THAN ONCE CHANGING LANES
REAR VISIBILITY IS ALMOST ALWAYS AN ISSUE WITH FASTBACK ROOFS BUT ALL CONSIDERED NOT AN ISSUE HERE
BLIND SPOT JUST BEHIND PASSENGER SEAT
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS
VISIBILITY IS POOR IN THE REAR QUARTERS
CAR NEEDS LANE CHANGE WARNINGS AND AUTO STOPPING FEATURE AND BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEMS
THE POST BETWEEN THE FRON WINDOW AND THE FRONT DOOR IS WIDE AND CREATES BLIND SPOTS
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE LACK OF SIDE REAR VISIBILITY CAN BE DANGEROUS
BECAUSE OF THE SMALL BACK WINDOW IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS IN THE BLIND SPOT
I FEEL THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
THERE SEEMS TO BE QUITE A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE ESPECIALLY WHEN MERGING ONTO FREEWAY TRAFFIC ALSO THERE IS NO SLIDE MECHANISM ON THE VISORS TO HELP BLOCK THE AREA BETWEEN THE VISOR AND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS PHENOMENAL LOVE THE GUIDED LINES WHEN PARKING MY WIFE EVEN LIKES IT
RE REVERSE CAR NEEDS A BACKUP CAMERA VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE IN RTHIS CAR NEEDS A BACKUP CAMERA VERY DIFFICULT TO DRIVE IN REVERSE
CORVETTE NEEDS BLIND SPOT CAPABILITY ON REAR VIEW MIRRORS
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE WARNING SYSTEM LIKE IN MY CADILLAC
TIGHT NIMBLE & HANDLES WELL @ 60 MPH IN AN 30 MPH CURVE TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT ON LEFT SIDE USING MIRRORS OR TURNING HEAD
I DO NOT FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT MY VISIBILITY IT DIMINISHED I HAVE HAD TO REMOVE THE REAR SEAT RIGHT HAND HEAD REST FOR A GREATER VIEW
STANDARD EQUIPMENT SHOULD INCLUDE LANE CHANGE DETECTOR ON MIRROR CAMERA FOR BACKING UP SHOULD ALSO BE TIED INTO THE DIRECTIONAL SIGNALS SO THAT CAMERA IS OPERATING WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS AWKWARDLY PLACED
A VEHICLE COSTING $80 000 SHOULD HAVE SOME SAFETY EQUIPMENT OTHER THAN AIR BAGS I HAVE A CADILLAC WHICH COST $52 000 WHICH HAS COLLISION AVOIDANCE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING BLIND SPOT DETECTION BEEPERS WARNING ABOUT BEING TO CLOSE FRONT OR REAR WH
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SEEM TO BE A LITTLE CHEAP THEY COULD BE STURDIER
DRIVER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS SOME VISIBILITY
THE CAR IS SO LOW VISIBILITY IS HINDERED BECAUSE OF THE TYPE OF CAR NOT BECAUSE OF ANY DESIGN FLAWS
BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES AND HAVE NEVER USED THE WIPERS
OVER THE SHOULDER VISIBILITY IS DIMINISHED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR MODEL
WHY THIS $75K CAR DOES NOT HAVE LANE DEPARTURE IS BEYOND ME IT IS A CONVERTIBLE AND YOU CAN T SEE OUT THE BACK OR THE SIDE LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS SHOULD HAVE BOTH BACKUP SENSORS AND LANE DEPARTURE IF AS THE DESIGNER SAID IT WAS LEFT OFF BECAUSE H
BACK UP CAMERA GIVES MISLEADING DISTANCE PERSPECTIVES THINGS IN REAR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR ON THE SCREEN DIFFICULT TO GET USED TO
REAR CAMERA IS USELESS IN RAIN AND SNOW
THE ONLY COMPLAINT I WOULD HAVE IS THE BLIND SPOTS BUT YOU HAVE THAT WITH ANY VEHICLE AND I DON T BELIEVE YOU WILL EVER GET RID OF THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM
VISABILITY BACKING IS PROBABLY MY LEAST FAVORITE
SOMETIMES I FIND MYSELF HAVING A HARD TIME SEEING WHILE CHANGING LANES ON THE INTERSTATE I FEEL THE BLIND SPOTS ARE TRULY BAD
DRIVER SIDE BLIND SPOT IS HUGE EVERY OTHER AREA VERY VISIBLE
HEADLIGHT HORIZON IS A BIT ODD
THERE APPEARS TO BE TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS
THERE ARE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS IN THE EQUINOX
BLIND SPOTS ARE HARD TO SEE THRU
THERE CLEARLY IS A BLIND SPOT
LOVE THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AUTOMATIC TINT AT NIGHT
THE THICKNESS OF THE FRAME AROUND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO VIEW ONCOMING TRAFFIC FROM THE RIGHT WHEN SITTING IN THE DRIVER S SEAT ALSO THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR JAMB GETS IN THE WAY WHEN CHECKING THE BLIND SPOT I WISH CHEVY HAD NOT
REALLY MISS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING ON THIS MODEL
PREVIOUS COMMENT ABOUT OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
THE ONLY THING I DISLIKE WOULD BE THE SMALL BLIND SPOT MIRROR THAT I SPOKE ABOUT IN THE LAST PAGE I DO FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THAT MIRROR DOES HELP AT LOT IN THE BLIND SPOTS FROM OTHER LANES
WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THEY TOOK AWAY THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS AND REPLACED THEM WITH NOTHING
YOU HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK
BACK BLIND SPOTS AND BACK CORNERS ARE REALLY BAD
I AM STILL GETTING USED TO THE VISIBILITY ON THE SIDES AND TOWARD THE REAR THE SIDE WINDOWS PROBABLY WORK FINE BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT FROM MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE AND I AM GOING THROUGH AN ADJUSTMENT PERIOD
GREAT VISIBILITY AND VERY EASY TO SEE ON ALL SIDES OF THE VEHICLE
VERY POOR SIDE REAR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING UP MUST USE THE CAMERAS ALWAYS
VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS LIMITED AND TAKING TIME TO GET USE TO
FORWARD VISIBILITY IN SMALL INDOOR CAR PARKS IS POOR
I FEEL LIKE IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT I CAN TURN MY HEAD BUT THE SUPPORT BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK DOOR IS IN THE WAY
I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE VISIBILITY LUV THIS CAR
I FEEL THE VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE WHEN TURNING LEFT AND HAVING TO LOOK OUT THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE VEHICLE THE RIGHT BACK SEAT WINDOW AND FRAMEWORK CAUSE THE VISIBILITY TO BE HASTENED
HAS A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
VISIBILTY FROM DRIVERS SIDE TO RIGHT SIDE OF VEHICLE THIS IS TRUE WHEN VIEWING ON ANGLE TOWARD THE PASSENGER SIDE AND BACK SIDE WINDOW
ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS COMPENSATE WELL FOR LACK OF DIRECT VISIBILITY
REAR BLIND SPOT IS TERRIBLE THE SIDE MIRRORS DON T REALLY HELP THAT MUCH
SEEMS LIKE VIEW OUT OF BACK WINDOW IS TOO SMALL BUT MAYBE JUST NOT USED TO IT AS THIS IS SMALLER CAR THAN MY LAST CAR THE REVIEW CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL FOR SEEING ANYTHING RIGHT BEHIND THE CAR
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE WITH MY NEW MALIBU IS THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT WHEN LOOKING TO THE LEFT ESPECIALLY WHEN STOPPED AT AN INTERSECTION AND YOU NEED TO SEE IF ANYTHING IS COMING BEFORE YOU START OUT I KEEP THE SEAT BACK A
SUGGEST BETTER QUALITY OF WIPER BLADES ON YOUR NEW VEHICLES
I HAVE HAD OTHER SUVS INCLUDING 3 FORD EXPLORERS AND 1 VOLVO X60 THIS VEHICLE HAS BETTER VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOTS TO SIDES THROUGH WINDOWS
BLIND SPOTS ARE HORRIBLE VERY HARD TO SEE WHEN YOU ARE CHANGING LANES
LOVE REAR CAMERA
PREVIOUSLY COMMENTED ON SIZE OF HEAD RESTS AND CREATING BLIND SPOTS
THE VISIBILITY OF THE BACKUP CAMERA IS VERY POOR ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT VERY FOGGY YES WE VE WIPED THE CAMERA LENS
REAR CAMERA DOES GET DIRTY IN WINTER TO EASY
ALTHOUGH THE REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY IS NOT THE BEST THE REAR CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEMS ARE VERY GOOD STEPS TOWARDS ELIMINATING THOSE ISSUES AS PROBLEMS
THE SLIGHTLY LOWER REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT IS BASED ON NOT USING THE ELECTRONIC AIDS REAR CAMERA AND LANE CHANGE ASSIST SINCE I M STILL NOT QUITE USED TO USING THEM THE LANE CHANGE ASSIST WORKS VERY WELL AS THE SIDE MIRRORS ALONE AR
THE HOOD DESIGN WHERE THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS RECESS SHOULD BE REDESIGNED THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER WAY TO PROTECT THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS FROM ACCUMULATING SNOW MAYBE THERE COULD BE A BUTTON TO PUSH TO OPEN THE AREA FOR THE WIPERS SO THEY CAN RE
THE REAR CAMERA NEEDS SOME FINE TUNING AND THE SUN VISORS SHOULD BE BIGGER AND HOW ABOUT INSTALLING A SMALL FRONT VENT WINDOW
HARD TO SEE BLIND SIDE TRAFFIC
I LOOKED AT SOME FORDS THAT HAD BETTER SIDE MIRRORS THEY WERE DESIGNED SO THAT THE DRIVER DID NOT HAVE A BLIND SPOT IT WOULD BE NICE IF GM ALSO HAD THAT DESIGN
PILLAR BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR PASSENGER SIDE IS A BLIND SPOT AND IS A STRUGGLE TO SEE ON COMING TRAFFIC FROM PASSENGER SIDE OF CAR WHILE DRIVING
THE HEADREST ON THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT BLOCK VISIBILITY ON THE RIGHT SIDE FOR TRAFFIC
REAR SEAT HEAD REST OBSTRUCT VIEW WHEN IN THE DOWN POSITION DOES NOT ALLOW FOR CHILD SAFETY SEAT TO BE FLUSH WITH BACK OF SEAT
REAR QUARTER VIEWS ARE HARD I HAVE ADJUSTED TO USING THE PASSENGER MIRROR MORE TO CHECK FOR VEHICLES THAT MAY BE IN MY BLIND SPOT
THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEM IS A BIT ANNOYING THOUGH I GUESS IT S FOR MY OWN GOOD
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS ARE A CONCERN SIDE MIRROR WARNING HELP BUT THEY AREN T ENOUGH
WHEN BACKING UP AND TURNING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE DARKENED BACK WINDOWS THE BACK UP CAMERA IS OK BUT I STILL LIKE TO LOOK FOR MYSELF TO CHECK FOR TRAFFIC
THERE MAY BE A SMALL BLIND SPOT FOR SEEING THE CAR COMING FROM BEHIND ON PASSENGER SIDE SWITCHING LANES SUDDENLY I NOTICED THE OTHER DAY DRIVERS HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF THIS
THE ENCORE HAS GREAT VISIBILITY 360
BLIND SIDE VIEW WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE COLOR HEADS UP DISPLAY IS A GREAT FEATURE THAT HELPS KEEP YOUR EYES ON THE ROAD
POOR VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS AIDED BY LANE WARNING SIGNAL THIS IMPROVES THE SAFETY SIGNIFICANTLY
REAR CAMERA THAT TURNS INDICATOR LINES WITH THE STEERING INPUT IS VERY EFFECTIVE SADLY THE LANE CHANGE BLIND SPOT CROSS TRAFFIC ET AL WARNING SYSTEMS ARE BUNDLED SUCH THAT HAVING THEM WOULD HAVE INCREASED VEHICLE PURCHASE PRICE MULTIPLES THOU
AS MENTIONED BEFORE FRONT PASSENGER HEADREST IS BULKY MAKES BIG BLIND SPOT
SMALL BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES BUT EVERY CAR HAS THAT
REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO LARGE AND CAUSE BLIND SPOTS
FROM DRIVERS SEAT THE FRONT POST BLOCKS SOME VISIBILITY TO THE SIDE
THE REAR CAMERA IS OFTEN BLURRY DUE TO CONDENSATION
VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES OR WHEN MERGING TRAFFIC FROM A MIDDLE TURN LANE IT S REALLY BAD REAR VISIBILITY ON SIDE OF BACK WINDOW IS VERY POOR THE TWO SIDE OF FRAME ARE TOO BIG
THE LANE CHANGE WARNING IS A LIFESAVER
THE VEHICLE CAMERA AND SHOWING YOU THE LINE PLUS THE ALARMS AROUND THE CAR WHEN CLOSE TO OBJECTS IS GREAT
I HAVE A FEW BLIND SPOTS LOOKING TO THE SIDES WHEN CHANGING LANES I REALLY LIKE THAT MY MIRRORS HAVE WARNING LIGHTS WHEN CARS ARE NEXT TO ME THAT REALLY HELPS
REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS WHEN IN UP POSITION CAUSE SOME VISIBILITY PROBLEMS
THERE ARE SOME BLINDS SPOTS REAR WINDOW AND FRONT POST BETWEEN WINDSHIELD AND WINDOWS THAT CAUSE ADDITIONAL CAUTION FOR DRIVER
MY RELATIVELY LOWER SCORES FOR SIDE AND FORWARD VISIBILITY STEM FROM TWO FACTORS 1 I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO THE GREENHOUSE VISIBILITY OF A SUV FOR MANY YEARS BEFORE THIS CAR SO I AM WARY OF THE LARGER SIDE BLINDSPOTS NOW AND 2 BEING VERY TALL I
FEEL THAT THE BACK WINDOW IS TOO SMALL IMPEDES VISABILITY
WHEN CHANGING LANES I HAVE A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER I HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES SO NOT TO HIT ANOTHER VEHICLE
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS HARD TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES
THANK GOD FOR REAR CAMERA WHEN BACKING UP REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR BUT THAT S THE TRADE OFF FOR THE STYLING SO I LL TAKE IT
VISIBILITY IS TYPICAL OF ALL SEDANS AND COUPS THAT I HAVE OWNED
REAR SIDE VISIBILITY IS LESS THAN I EXPECTED FROM A CADILLAC
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURES
BLIND SPOT VISIBILTY IS POOR BLIND SPOT MONITORS ARE REQUIRED EQUIPMENT
IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS STILL A SMALL BLIND SPOT
ELECTRONIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT IS AMAZING
THE BIG DRAWBACK IS REAR VISIBILITY THE REAR ROOF COLUMNS ARE THICK AND SLOPING AND RESULT IN POOR SIGHTLINES TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT REAR SINCE MY CAR LACKS THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS OR OTHER ELECTRONICS THAT WOULD MINIMIZE THIS PROBLEM THE P
VISIBILITY IS GOOD
I HAVE NEVER LIKED CARS FOR THE LACK OF VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK BUT THE BACK UP CAMERA HAS HELPED WITH THAT
NOT THE BEST VISIBILITY IN THE CAR WHEN LOOKING THROUGH FRONT MIRROR OR SIDE MIRRORS TO CHANGE LANES
HAVE TO BE CAREFUL OF BLIND SPOT BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR PASSENGER SEATS WHEN TURNING
EXTERIOR MIRRORS COULD HAVE A BIGGER BLIND SPOT MIRROR
I WREAKED THIS CAR ONE WEEK AFTER PURCHASE AND TWO AIR BAGS DEPLOYED SOME BRUSING BUT NO SERIOUS INJURY
HARD TO SEE THOSE BLIND SPOTS AT BACK CORNERS ADDED EXTRA SMALL MIRROR YO OUTSIDE CORNER TO HELP MAGNIFY AREA BUT STILL DIFFICULT TO SEE
ON SAT IS A RIPOFF BRAKES ARE SO BAD IN WINTER I WAS LIED TO BY DEALER RE BRAKES WANTED ROOF RACKS WAS TOLD NOT AVAILABLE
I FIRST DECIDED THE SPARK WAS A TOP PIC AS A CAR FOR MY TEEN DAUGHTER WHEN I HEARD ON THE NEWS THAT IT WAS THE ONLY CAR IN ITS CLASS TO PASS THE SAFETY TESTS AND IT HAD 10 AIRBAGS IT WAS EVEN BETTER WHEN IT WAS CUTE
HAVING 10 AIRBAGS AND THE ASSOCIATED PERCEPTION OF SAFETY WAS A HUGE FACTOR IN SELECTING THIS VEHICLE
CORRECT THE RIGHT SIDE BLIND SPOT CREATED BY THE RIGHT HAND REAR DOOR HANDLE PLACEMENT
NEED BETTER VISIBILITY REDUCE BLIND SPOT TO IMPROVE SAFETY WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE ELECTRIC BLUE PAINT COLOR IS NICELY VERY VISIBLE ON THE ROAD YET NOT TOO GARISH
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH VISIBILITY IN THE REAR RIGHT CORNER THE REAR RIGHT SIDE PASSENGER WINDOW IS SMALL AND THE CORNER IS THICK MAKING VEHICLES VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN TRANSITING INTO A RIGHT LANE THERE IS TOO LARGE OF A BLIND SPOT THE REA
IT S HARD TO SEE THE BLINDSPOTS
VISIBILITY OUT REAR WINDOW MUCH BETTER WITH 3RD ROW DOWN
I LIKE THE WARNING SYSTEM THAT TELLS ME IF THERE IS SOMETHING NEXT TO ME
VEHICLE DRIVES WELL ADAQUATE ACCELERATION RUNS SMOOTH AND VISIBILITY IS GREAT
NEEDS FRONT PARKING SENSORS STANDARD BRIGHTER HEADLIGHTS
THE VISIBILITY FOR CHANGING LANES IS BAD THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER REAR SIDE THIS IS MITIGATED BY THE LANE CHANGING SENSOR BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO CHECK BEFORE YOU CAN CHANGE LANES IF YOU NEED TO
REAR VIEW MIRROR IN THE WAY OF A 6 2 DRIVER LEFT RIGHT OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS TOO SMALL
HEAD REST IN BACK SEATS BLOCK VISIBILITY
I A SHORT PERSON 5 2 SO I AM NOT SURPRISED THAT I HAVE DIFFICULTY SEEING IF A CAR IS IN MY BLIND SPOT WHEN I TURN TO LOOK I HAVE THE DRIVER S SEAT ADJUSTED SO THAT IT IS ABOUT AS HIGH AS IT WILL GO AND I GET A NICE VIEW OF THE BACK SEAT WITH
I FEEL THAT THE MIRROWS SHOULD HAVE 25% LARGER FIELD OF VIEW TO BE OPTIMIAL I M VERY CAREFUL WHEN USING THE MIRROWS BECAUSE OF BLIND SPOTS
BACK UP IS DANGEROUS IF NOT FOR REAR MONITOR BLIND SPOTS
REAR VISIBILITY IS BAD THE WINDOW IN NOT LOW ENOUGH
THE LT MODEL NEED HID LIGHTS STANDARD
SIDE MIRRORS ARE A LITTLE SMALL MAKING VISIBILITY HARD AT TIMES
I WISH I GOT THE MODEL WITH THE REAR CAMERA BECAUSE IT S HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK WITH THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS IN THE WAY
GOOD OVERALL VISABILITY
THE SPARK EV IS VERY EASY TO GET IN & OUT OF & IS TALL ENOUGH THAT I CAN SEE FAR AROUND ME IN EVERY DIRECTION THE WINDOWS GIVE GREAT VISIBILITY & CAUSE VERY LITTLE BLIND SPOTS IF ANY IT COULD USE A BACKUP CAMERA IF ONLY TO HAVE TECH SPECS TO COM
HORRIBLE BLIND SPOTS MIRRORS USELESS WHEN CHANGING LANES
TO IMPROVE REAR VISIBILITY I REMOVED THE REAR HEADRESTS
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT THE SECOND AND THIRD ROW HEAD RESTS ARE IN THE WAY EVEN WHEN THEY ARE IN THE DOWN POSITION
THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT WHEN A CAR IS PASSING ME ANOTHER BIG BLIND SPOT IS IN THE RIGHT REAR
A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE REAR VIEW OF RIGHT LANE WHEN DRIVING DUE TO HEADRESTS ON SECOND ROW SEATS
SMALL CONVEX MIRROR INTEGRATED INTO THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR WAS A GREAT FEATURE
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES ON THE SIDE OF YOU I FEEL THERE ARE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES BESIDE MY VEHICLE WHEN I AM PASSING OR MAKING A LANE CHANGE I AM OFTEN WORRIED I WILL MISS SEEING A SMALL VEHICLE IN MY BLIND SPOT
A LITTLE BIT OF A BLIND SPOT FROM DRIVERS SEAT LOOKING THROUGH SIDE REAR WINDOW FOR TRAFFIC
THE WIDTH OF THE A PILLAR CREATES A BLIND SPOT TO THE RIGHT SIDE
THERE IS A HIGH LEVEL OF BLIND SPOTS WITHIN THE VEHICLE ESPECIALLY FOR LANE CHANGING AND TURNING CORNERS
BLIND SPOT AT CORNERS OF WINDSHIELD
BELIEVE THAT CHEVROLET HAS SACRIFICED REARWARD VISIBILITY FOR STYLE OWNED FORD ESCAPE AND ALWAYS HAD GREAT SIDE AND REARWARD VISIBILITY FIRST TIME I TOOK THE TRAVERSE OUT ON A FREEWAY I ALMOST PULLED INTO A LANE WITH A CAR IN MY BLIND SPOT
TRULY LIKE THE SIDE COLLISION AVOIDANCE
NEED TO ADD CONVEX BUBBLE TO SECTION OF OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS TO ELIMINATE BLIND SPOTS
I FEEL THE REAR VISIBILITY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED JUST A SMIDGE
OWNED A PRIUS BEFORE AND THE VOLT HAS MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY
CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT TO THE REAR ESPECIALLY WHEN BACKING UP A REAR VIEW CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD
BLIND SPOT ON A PILLAR TO THE LEFT WHEN DRIVING MORE SIGNIFICANT THAT I THOUGHT
THE REAR VISION CAMERA GETS DIRTY VERY QUICKLY RENDERING IT LESS EFFECTIVE
SUN VISORS DON T EXTEND BLIND SPOTS ARE TOUGH TO SEE EVEN WITH HEAD CHECKS
POOR VISIBILITY OUT BACK WINDOW
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S FRONT LEFT IN THE SLOPING AREA WHERE THE DOOR AND THE FRAME MEET IT SEEMS TOO WIDE TO ME FOR ADEQUATE VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BAD HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL CHANGING LANES
VISIBILITY PAST REAR VIDEO DISPLAY IS HARD
THE PILLER FOR THE WINDSHIELD IS TOO WIDE CAUSES A BLIND SPOT
I VE HAD A NUMBER OF NEAR MISS LANE CHANGING COLLISIONS ALREADY THE BLIND SPOT IS PRETTY BIG FOR A VEHICLE THAT LOW TO THE GROUND I DO A LOT OF NECK STRETCHING TO ENSURE MY SIDE IS CLEAR I M GLAD I HAVE A LOT OF TORQUE AT HIGH SPEED BECAUSE EV
TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO AS THE VISIBILITY IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED THROUGH SIDE WINDOWS ALSO LIMITED VISIBILITY WHEN THE SEAT IS RAISED DUE TO THE REARVIEW MIRROR
THE REAR VISIBILITY THOUGH THE REAR MIRROR IS EXTREMELY LIMITED THE REAR PILLARS AND CENTER PILLARS BLOCK THE VIEW WHILE LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER THE THICKNESS OF THE FRONT PILLARS AND ANGLE CAN MARKING PARKING DIFFICULT
REAR CAMERA IS GREAT
REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS HELPFUL
POOR BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY
RARE WINDOW VIEW ARE QUITE LIMITED I WISH BLIND SPOT DETECTION CAN BE AS ROBUST AS HONDA S CRV
REAR CAMERA IS PRACTICALLY REQUIRED
THE A PILLAR IS VERY WIDE AND IN A POSITION WHERE A CAR COMING TOWARD ME AT A CURVE MAY NOT BE VISIBLE
I JUST DON T FEEL I SEE WELL ENOUGH IN BACK OF ME AND DON T WANT TO TOTALLY RELY ON THE BACK UP CAMERA
THE REAR ROOF POSTS ARE WIDE AND RESTRICT REAR VISIBILITY
I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING AROUND CORNERS WHEN TURNING TO THE LEFT I FIND MYSELF LOOKING OUT THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW FOR BETTER VISIBILITY MOST NOTICEABLE ON CURVY ROADS
THE BLINDSPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS A MUST AS THE BLINDSPOT IS VERY BIG WITH THIS VEHICLE
STILL NOT USE TO SOLELY RELYING ON BACK UP CAMERA
WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPOT OR DRIVEWAY THERE IS A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER THE PASSENGER SIDE VIEW
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FROM WHERE THE CAR PANEL SEPARATES THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND THE DRIVERS WINDOW EVEN HAD THIS PROBLEM WITH MY MALIBU WHICH I LOVED AND MORE SO WITH THE VOLT
VERY POOR VISIBILITY OUT OF BACK WINDOW GLAD CAR HAS BACK UP CAMERA
THE FRONT A PILLAR IS MASSIVE I KNOW THIS IS DUE TO CRASH SAFETY BUT IT IS RIGHT IN THE VIEW OF THE ROAD WHEN TAKING A 45 DEG TURN TO THE LEFT IF YOU BEND FORWARD A LITTLE BIT THIS HELPS MODERN CARS ARE JUST GOING TO HAVE THIS AFTER THE ROLL OV
THE POSITION OF THE FRAME CAUSES A BLIND SPOT WHILE TURNING LEFT THE WINDOW AND FRAME ON THE PASSENGER SIDES GIVES A BLIND SPOT IF YOU HAVE A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT SET
THE VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY IS HINDERED WHILE TRAVELING AT SPEEDS OF 70 MPH AND THE SECOND TRANSMISSION STARTS TO GO OUT TRUE STORY BY THE WAY
BAD BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
WARNING SYSTEMS ARE GOOD BUT TOO MANY DIFFERENT WARNING SOUNDS DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE IS ALERTING NO BLIND SIDE ALERT IN SIDE MIRRORS FOR ALL THE SAFETY ITEMS ON THIS CAR HOW COULD THAT BE MISSING I HAD IT ON MY LAST CAR BUI
SOMEHOW THE VISIBILITY IS POOR WHEN TURNING ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT
LOVE BEING ABLE TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOT ALERTING SHOULD COME STANDARD ON ALL CHRYSLER VEHICLES
THERE ARE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS DUE TO THE WAY THE CAR IS CONSTRUCTED BUT AFTER A WHILE I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REMEMBER TO MAKE SURE TO RECHECK MY VIEW DUE TO THE BLIND SPOTS
LIGHTS DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY DIM AND GO BRIGHT ALL THE TIME WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT ALWAYS COME ON AUTOMATICALLY
THE CAR HAS A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS WHILE DRIVING
VERY BAD BLIND STOP WHEN CHANGING LANES HEADLIGHT ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH I MUST DRIVE AT NIGHT WITH THE HI BEAMS TO SEE IN FRONT OF ME
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS IN THE SIDE MIRRORS
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF SAFETY CHANGES IN 15 YEARS SO TO COMPARE MY NEW TOWN AND COUNTRY TO MY OLD DODGE CARAVAN IS QUITE A DIFFERENCE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE NEWER SAFETY FEATURES TO INCLUDE THE BACK UP CAMERA BLIND SPOT NOTIFICATION AND
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS WORTHLESS WHEN ONE OR BOTH TV SCREENS ARE DOWN THE TVS SHOULD BE MOVED OVER 6 8 IN SO THAT THE MIRROR ALLOWS THE DRIVER TO SEE OUT THE REAR
REAR VIEW MIRROR IS PLACED TO LOW DOWN THE WINDOW THAT IT MAKES IT TO HARD TO VISIBILITY OF ON COMING OBJECTS
AS A TALL DRIVER I CAN T SEE PAST THE LEFT SHOULDER PILLAR TO CHANGE LANES ON MY LEFT SIDE THE FRONT WINDSHIELD PILLARS ON BOTH SIDES ALSO CAUSES SOME SERIOUS BLIND SPOTS WHEN TAKING SHARP TURNS TO BOTH SIDES OF THE CAR
I LOVE MY VOLT BUT THE FRONT VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED
BLIND SPOTS TO BOTH SIDES AND TO THE REAR
BLIND SPOTS ARE WORSE ON THE VOLT THAN I HAVE EXPERIENCED BOTH FRONT SIDE PARTICULARLY FRONT LEFT DOWN POST AND REAR SIDE ON BOTH SIDES OF VEHICLE
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT NECESSARY A PROBLEM IT REQUIRES AT LEAST TWO ATTEMPTS LOOKING OUT THE BACK PRIOR TO CHANGING LANES
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS BLURRY OFTEN APPEARS FOGGY
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE FRONT TO JUDGE WHERE THE END OF THE HOOD BUMPERS ARE WHEN PARKING NO MATTER HOW HIGH I HAVE ADJUSTED THE SEAT OTHERS DRIVING THE CAR TO SEE SAY THE SAME THING VERY LOW VISIBILITY TO JUDGE THE CAR S DISTANC
REAR HEADRESTS ARE LARGE AND MAKE VISIBILITY OUT OF REARVIEW MIRROR DIFFICULT
WHILE STOPPING LOOKING RIGHT VISIBILITY HAS BLIND SPOT FOR ONCOMING CAR
REAR VIEW MIRROR VILIBILITY LIMITED BY REAR HEAD RESTES HOWEVER REAR VIEW CAMERA MAKES UP FOR IT
BREAKING IN THE R T MODEL IS EXCEPTIONAL FOR A MINI VAN SAFETY FIRST WITH KIDS WE LOVE IT
NEEDS TURN SIGNAL LIGHTS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
REAR VISIBILITY IS A PROBLEM I HIT A CAR WHILE BACKING UP BECAUSE I COULDNT SEE IT I THINK REAR VIEW CAMERA MUST BE A STANDARD FEATURE TO COMPENSATE FOR TH VERY POOR REAR VISIBILITY
I CAN SEE ALRIGHT TOWARDS THE BACK AND SIDES BUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR DOES COME IN HANDY EVEN MORE SO THE REAR CROSS PATH DETECTION HAS COME IN HANDY A NUMBER OF TIMES WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACES PARTICULARLY WHEN SURROUNDED BY TALL S
HARD TO SEE WITH BACK UP CAMERA WHEN SUN IS BRIGHT
I BELIEVE BLIND SIDE MONITORING SHOULD BE STANDARD IT IS ONE OF THE FEATURES I MISS THE MOST IN THE VAN HAD I KNOWN THEY DIDN T HAVE IT I MIGHT NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS ONE
REAR VISIBILITY IS BAD IN ALL MINI VANS HOWEVER THE REAR CAMERA HELPS TREMENDOUSLY
JUST LOVE ALL THE SAFETY THAT COMES WITH THE VEHICLE MAKES ME FEEL SAFE
PASSENGER WIPER BLADE DOESN T DO A GOOD JOB CLEARING THE WINDOW TOWARDS THE RIGHT SIDE
SHOULD COME STANDARD WITH LANE CHANGING COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THE SIDE MIRRORS WORK WELL THE BLIND SPOT CAUSED BY THE B PILLAR AND THE PASSENGER SEAT HEADREST COULD BE AN ISSUE
VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE BACK AND THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT AT PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT
BLIND SPOT RECOGNITION IS ABSOLUTELY NEEDED I AM GLAD THIS VEHICLE HAS IT
EXCELLENT REAR SIDE VISIBILITY
I KNEW WHAT I WAS GETTING INTO WITH RESPECT TO THE VISIBILITY NO COMPLAINTS
VISIBILITY IS MORE ACCEPTABLE NOW WITH REAR CAMERA AND BLINDSPOT FEATURE
NASTY BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER TO CHANGE LANES
TERRIBLE BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR OF THE CAR
YES THE C PILLAR IS BIG BUT THE CAR HAS A BACK UP CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING IT WORKS GREAT
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHEN BACKING OUT OF A SLANTED SPACE DUE TO BLINDSPOTS
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE RT SIDE AND WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD TO LOOK TO THE RIGHT THEN THE PASSENGER HEAD REST IS IN THE WAY IT S VERY HARD TO SEE WHAT S IN THE LANE ON THE RIGHT
BEING THAT CHALLENGER S ARE 2 DOOR THE BLIND SPOT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT POSSIBLY RESTRICTED BY 2ND AND 3RD ROW SEATS HEAD RESTS
THERE ARE SEVERE BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING THE VEHICLE ESPECIALLY ON THE SIDES THE TWO SMALL WINDOWS IN THE BACK ARE USELESS PERHAPS THE BACK END IS TOO HIGH
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE WHAT IS NEXT TO THE REAR QUARTER AREA OF THE CAR THERE IS A TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT IN THAT AREA
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WHERE THE FRAME IS
THE REAR CROSS PATH DETECTION AND HUGE BACKUP CAMERA MAKE UP FOR THE LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY A SPOT MIRROR ADDED TO THE PASSENGER SIDE HELPS WHEN CHANGING LANES
BACK UP CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT FOR SAFETY REASONS
WHILE THE VISIBILITY IS NOT THE BEST IN A CHALLENGER THE ADDITION OF THE BACK UP CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM MAKES THE 15 EASIER TO DRIVE THEN MY OTHER CHALLENGERS
THE CAR HAS HORRIBLE BLIND SPOTS
REAR VIEW MIRROR DOES NOT AUTO DIM NO WAY TO ADJUST IT
GREAT HEADLIGHTS THAT LIGHT UP THE ROAD ADDING TO SAFETY AT NIGHT
HUGE BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT REAR MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BACK OUT INTO TRAFFIC OR CHANGE LANES
EXCELLENT WARNING SYSTEM A GREAT SAFETY FEATURE
DESIGN OF VEHICLE CAUSES MAJOR BLIND SPOTS HOWEVER INCLUDING THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM GREATLY IMPROVES THE SAFETY FOR CHANGING LANES AND BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACES AND DRIVEWAYS
BLIND SPOT IN SIDE VIEW MIRROR DRIVERS SIDE
THERE ARE DEFINITELY SOME BLIND SPOTS WHEN VEERING ONTO OBLIQUE TURNS MOSTLY FROM THE SIDE FRAMES BETWEEN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND SIDE WINDOWS
BLIND SPOT ALERT SENSORS SHOULD BE A STANDARD IN THE VEHICLE
I LOVE THE SIZE AND SOLID FEELING OF THE TRUCK AND THE ALL AROUND VISIBILITY WITH THE LARGE WINDOWS THE LOW BEAM LIGHTS SEEM TO ALMOST HAVE AN EYEBROW ON THEM ESPECIALLY ON DARK COUNTRY ROADS HOWEVER THE HIGH BEAMS AND FOG LIGHTS ARE VERY
STANDARD BACKUP CAMERA WOULD BE GOOD
MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL BLIND SPOTS DUE TO A PILLAR BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR SEATS
LARGE TRUNK LIMITS REAR VISIBILITY
REAR VISIBILITY REQUIRES BACK UP CAMERA BECAUSE OF HIGH TRUNK DESIGN FOR CRASH SAFETY
REAR VISIBILITY NOT GOOD DUE TO HIGH TRUNK UNFORTUNATELY THE TRUNK LINE MAKES THE CAR VERY ATTRACTIVE IN PROFILE
THE ONLY THING PREVENTING A 10 IN THE FORWARD VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT IS THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE PLACED AND SIZED SUCH THAT THEY BLOCK A LOT OF VISIBILITY TO THE DRIVERS SIDE
WOULD HAVE LIKED THE OPTION OF A BACKUP CAMERA
I LOVE THE REAR FACING LED LIGHTS IN THE SIDE MIRRORS FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING GOOSE NECK TRAILER
THE SIDE MIRRORS CREATE A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT FOR TRAFFIC
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE THE WORST ONES MADE
HOOD SEEMS TO LIMIT VISIBILITY COMPARED TO MY 2004 SILVERADO WOULD LIKE TO RAISE SEAT UP HIGHER TO SEE MORE ABOVE THE CARGO MIRRORS
WHEN THE VEHICLE IS BACKING UP THE LIGHTS FOCUS ON WHERE THE CAMERA IS POINTING BUT VERY LITTLE LIGHT GOES OUT TO THE SIDES WHERE I LOOK WHEN I LOOK IN THE SIDE MIRRORS THIS MAKES IT HARD TO USE THE MIRRORS AT NIGHT TO BACKUP
VISIBILITY IS NOT GOOD IN THIS TRUCK COMPARED TO MY FORD YOU SIT LOW IN THIS TRUCK SO THE HOOD BLOCKS YOUR VIEW THE FRONT PILLARS AND SIDE MIRRORS ARE CRAZY BIG AND BLOCK YOUR VISION BIG TIME WHEN TURNING
REAR VIEW MIRROR IS LARGE WHICH IS GOOD WHEN USING IT BUT SEEMS TO BE MOUNTED A LITTLE LOW WHICH SOMETIMES MAKES IT GET IN THE WAY WHEN LOOKING ACROSS PASS SIDE OF HOOD
I LIKE THE NEW SAFETY FEATURES
LONG FRONT HOOD MAKES IT SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO SEE CURB EDGES TAKES A BIT TO GET USE TO SPLIT SIDE MIRRORS AND THE LARGE SIZE MIRRORS AFFECTS SIDE FORWARD VISIBILITY
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHERE THE MIRRORS MEET THE A PILLAR IT IS SURPRISING YOU DON T NOTICE IT AT FIRST BUT AFTER YOU DRIVE IT FOR A WHILE YOU WILL REALIZE THAT A VAN CAN GET LOST BEHIND THE MIRROR MODEL WAS THE SAME COULD HAVE DONE AL
SEAT BELTS ARE DIFFICULT TO BUCKLE REAR SIDE VIEWS ARE HARD TO SEE WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACE
NEEDS BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM
COLLISON AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IS AN EXCELLANT ADDITION ADDS GREAT FEELING OF SAFETY
HEIGHT IS GOOD YOU CAN SEE OVER MOST TRAFFIC AND THERE ARE LITTLE OR NO BLIND SPOTS
THE SPLIT REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE NOT THE BEST AND HARD TO SET WHERE AT LEAST RIGHT REAR VISABILITY IS POOR AS TO VEHICLES OVERTAKING OR PASSING YOU ON RIGHT
REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS BLOCK VISIBILITY THROUGH REAR WINDOW AND NEEDED TO BE REMOVED WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY COULD BE ADJUSTED DOWN OR TILTED SO AS NOT TO OBSTRUCT VIEW WHEN NO PASSENGERS ARE IN THE REAR SEATS
VISIBILITY IS OVERALL GOOD
BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE QUARTER PANEL AREA
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE
HAS BLIND SPOTS AUTO DIMMING FOR BRIGHT LIGHTS VERY ANNOYING BRIGHT LIGHTS NOT SO BRIGHT
I WOULD LIKE BETTER VISIBILITY OF BLIND SPOTS WITH THE SIDE MIRRORS
THE SPLIT SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR ARE GOOD IDEA BUT NEED REFINEMENT
HID LIGHTS ARE LONG OVERDUE
HAD A FORD F150 IT HAD THE REAR VIEW CAMERA DISPLAY ON THE MAIN TOUCH SCREEN IN CONSOLE NOT MIRROR THE FORD HAD BETTER VIEW OF BACKING AREA
THE BACK UP CAMERA MAKES BACKING UP A BREEZE
THE SUN VISORS ARE IN SCALE WITH THE CAR BUT ARE TOO SMALL TO BE REALLY EFFECTIVE FOR ME THERE IS A BIG BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES THAT I M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH
NEEDS FRONT PARKING CAMERA
THE HEAD LIGHTS ARE NOT THE BEST MY TRUCK WAS HARD TO FIND AS IT IS A MANUAL THE DEALER SHIP FOUND IT IN PENNSYLVANIA AND HAD IT SHIPPED TO OHIO I WISH IT CAME WITH FOG LIGHTS OR THE OPTION TO INSTALL THEM LATER LIKE MY OTHER RAMS THE ALL CAME WIT
SMALL CONVEX MIRRORS ARE DIFFICULT TO GET ALIGNED AND JUDGE WHERE VEHICLES ARE WHEN CHANGING LANES
VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING IS LIMITED DUE TO LARGE C PILLARS BUT THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED IN A TRUCK OF THIS SIZE
THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS COULD BE BIGGER THERE IS NO VISIBILITY BETWEEN THE SIDE WINDOWS FRONT TO BACK I M SURE THE SUPPORT BETWEEN THE WINDOWS CONTRIBUTES TO THE CAR S SAFETY RATINGS AND THAT S IMPORTANT
VERY LITTLE IF ANY BLIND SPOT ON A BIG TRUCK
CHANGING LANES B PILLAR VERY LARGE AND PRODUCES A LARGE BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING REARWARD AND TO THE RIGHT WHEN CHANGING LANES OR BACKING VEHICLE THE HIGH HEADRESTS AND DOOR POSTS RESTRICT VISIBILITY
LITTLE OR NO VISIBILITY ON DRIVER SIDE REAR WINDOW FIAT INSTALLED FISH EYE MIRROR ON DRIVER SIDE MIRROR FOR CHECKING BLIND SPOT DON T LIKE BUT I AM GETTING USED TO CHECKING THE FISH EYE WHEN CHANGING LANES
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DESIGN OF THE SIDE MIRRORS IN THAT IT SHOWS THE BLIND SPOT BECAUSE THE VISIBILITY LOOKING OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER IS MINIMAL DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE CAR MUCH CLEARER LOOKING FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT OVER THE RIGHT SHOULDER
TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOTS LOOKING BACK
DEFINITELY SOME BLIND SPOTS THE SIDE MIRROR HAS A SMALLER SECTION OF MAGNIFICATION ON IT BUT I CAN NEVER TELL WHAT IT S SUPPOSED TO BE TELLING ME BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO HAVE IT S OWN BLIND SPOT AS WELL I PRESUME I M SUPPOSED TO COMBINE THE TWO
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT AND I TRULY WISH I COULD ADJUST MY SEAT UP TO SEE BETTER OVER THE HOOD THE TRUCK WAS NOT DESIGNED WITH SOMEONE OF MY HEIGHT 5 2
THE BLIND SPOTS ON THIS CAR ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS
MIRRORS WITH THE LANE ASSIST PORTION IS A GREAT SAFETY FEATURE
COULD USE A FORWARD CAMERA FOR PARKING JUST LIKE THE REAR ONE
THE SUN VISORS ARE TOO SMALL FOR THE SIZE OF THE WINDSHIELD THERE IS A LARGE SPACE BETWEEN THE TWO VISORS WHERE THE SUN SHINES IN AND CREATES A SERIOUS VISIBILITY PROBLEM
IF THE CAR WASN T SO SHORT I MAY HAVE RAN OVER SOMEONE BY NOW THE REAR DRIVER S SIDE & PASSENGER SIDE CORNERS OF THE CAR ARE TOTALLY INVISIBLE THE DRIVER REAR VIEW HAS A FISH EYE SECTION OF MIRROR WHICH IS VITAL & FAIRLY GENIUS IN MY OPINI
ONCE INSIDE THE CAR IT FEELS MUCH BIGGER THAN IT LOOKS VERY GOOD 360 VISIBILITY AND HEAD ROOM ENOUGH FOR A TALL PERSON WEARING A HAT
IT IS HARD TO JUDGE CLEARANCE OF FRONT BUMPER WITH PARKING STOPS NEED FRONT CAMERA SIMILAR TO REAR CAMERA
RAM NEEDS TO INCLUDE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS IN THE VEHICLES THE SIZE OF THIS TRUCK MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT BLIND SPOTS EVEN WITH THE LARGER TOW MIRRORS THE TECHNOLOGY IS OUT THERE RAM NEEDS TO USE IT
THERE ARE LARGE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES THAT EVEN THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS DON T ALWAYS PICK UP
AGAIN I M STILL GETTING USED TO THE DRIVERS SIDE BLIND SPOT BUT THE SPLIT SIDE VIEW MIRROR HELPS I M ALSO NOT USED TO THE REAR WINDOW BEING SMALLER THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR HONDA CIVIC BUT THE VISIBILITY IS ADEQUATE
LOVE THE INFORMATION SCREEN
IT S BEEN ICY HERE SO THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS MAY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED IN A STORM BUT THEY ARE MISSING SPOTS AND THEY ARE ONLY 3 MONTHS OLD THE SUN VISORS COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER TO COVER MORE SPACE THE HEADLIGHTS ARE BETTER THAN THE OLD FIAT WHE
I LIKE THE EXTRA LITTLE MIRROR TO HELP WITH THE BLIND SPOT BUT I WOULD STILL LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TURN MY HEAD TO THE RIGHT AND CHECK MY BLIND SPOT HOWEVER I CAN T SEE ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THE UPWARD SWEEP OF THE REAR WINDOWS
DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT SHOULDER CHECK IS A REAL ISSUE THE MAGNIFIED MIRROR HELPS BUT IT S DISTORTION IS ALMOST TOO MUCH AND I M CONTINUALLY SURPRISED BY HOW CLOSE A VEHICLE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT USING THE DISTORTED MIRROR WOULD BE NICE IF IT WA
VIEW FROM BACKUP CAMERA IS FLAT CHANGE IT TO 3D TO MAKE IT EASIER TO JUDGE DISTANCE SUPPORT COLUMNS OF ROOF TO WIDE ESPECIALLY IN FRONT INTERFERING WITH VISION BACK WINDOW AND BACK SIDE WINDOWS TOO SMALL
THE USE OF FOG LIGHTS ON DARK ROADS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT FOR THE OLDER DRIVER I M ONE PERHAPS A STRONGER FOG LAMP COULD BE INCLUDED A TURNING PACKAGE FOR LIGHTS WOULD ALSO HELP
LOVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA LOVE THE VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS FOR THE DRIVER
I HAVE TROUBLE USING THE REAR CAMERA I FEEL FUNNY I JUST LOOK WHEN I PUT IT IN REVERSE TO SEE IF SOMETHING IS BACK THERE THEN LOOK OUT THE BACK WINDOW TO MOVE
I LOVE THE CONVEX MIRRORS ON THE SIDE DOOR MIRROR THAT ALLOW THE DRIVER TO SEE THE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES I BELIEVE THE CONVEX MIRRORS ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN THE DETECTION SYSTEM USED ON THE HIGHEST END MODEL
I WOULD STILL LIKE THERE TO BE A BLIND SPOT MIRROR IN ADDITION TO THE LIGHTED INDICATOR ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
BLIND SPOT MIRROR COULD BE ADDED TO PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR
I DON T LIKE AUTOMATIC DIMMING REAR VIEW MIRRORS THEY DON T GET DIM ENOUGH AND THEY DON T DIM SOON ENOUGH
WOULD LIKE A DUAL DRIVER SIDE SUN VISOR ONE TO SWING TO THE SIDE AND AT THE SAME TIME LEAVE ONE IN FRONT
THE ONLY COMMENT I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE IS REGARDING THE PASSENGER S WINDSHIELD WIPER OPTIMALLY I WOULD LIKE FOR IT TO COVER A BIT MORE OF THE TOP OF THE WINDSHIELD IT SLIGHTLY OBSCURES THE PASSENGER S VIEW HOWEVER FROM THE DRIVER S SIDE THIS
THIS ESCAPE IS HARDER TO SWITCH LANES THAN MY OLD ESCAPE I DO NOT FEEL THE VISIBILITY IS THE SME
ALL VEHICLES HAVE LANE CHANGING VISIBILITY PROBLEMS BUT THE BLIND SPOT LANE DEPARTURE WARNING LIGHTS IN THE MIRRORS REALLY HELP EXCEPT IN EXCESSIVE HIGH SPEED PASSING SITUATIONS WHEN VEHICLES PASS ONLY BEING ALERT AND WATCHING IN ALL MIRRORS CAN
WIPER BLADES COULD BE IMPROVED
WISH IT HAD HID HEADLIGHTS FOR THE MONEY WE PAID FOR THIS LEVEL OF THE EXPEDITION
BLIND SPOT INDICATORS ON MIRRORS A NICE FEATURE HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW
WISH BLIND SPOT WAS EASIER TO SEE NEED BLIND SPOT TECH TO WARN ME WHEN SOMEONE IS IN BLIND SPOT
THE ONLY BLIND SPOT FOR ME IS THE SECOND ROW SEATS HEADRESTS
BACK UP CAMERA LENS GETS DIRTY EASILY
PRETTY BAD BLIND SPOTS TO DRIVERS LEFT BUT THE MIRRORS DO HELP TREMENDOUSLY
BEST VIEW FROM DRIVER S SEAT OF THIS CLASS THAT I TEST DROVE A PILLAR LEAST INTRUSIVE AMONG FULL SIZE SUVS GOOD REARWARD VISIBILITY LOW SILL HEIGHT GIVES GOOD VIEW WHILE PARKING NAVIGATING TIGHT SPACES
COMING FROM A 2004 EXPEDITION THERE CERTAINLY SEEM TO BE BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY WHEN CHANGING LANES I AM VERY GLAD I HAVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
THE WIPER BLADES SEEM VERY FLIMSY AND NOT HOLDING UP WELL WITH THE COLD WEATHER
WHEN HEAD REST FOR PASSENGER SEAT IS RAISED SIDE REAR VISIBILITY IS RESTRICTED
VISIBILITY OUT OF BACK WINDOW COULD BE BETTER
THE ALERT SYSTEM IS SENSITIVE AND IF IT IS SNOWING IT GOES OFF EVEN IF THERE IS NOTHING THERE BECAUSE THE SENSOR IS COVERED AND THIS GETS DISTRACTING WHILE DRIVING
THE AUTOMATIC WINDSHEILD WIPERS DO NOT ALWAYS WORK PROPERLY THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHEN THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY COME ON WHEN THERE IS RAIN ALL OVER THE WINDSHIELD AS WELL AS THERE BEING LITTLE RAIN ON THE WINDSHEILD AND THE
THE VEHICLE FOR THE PRICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH HID LIGHTS
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR IN MIRRORS
THE TRUCK REALLY NEEDS BUILT IN CONVEX MIRRORS ALTHOUGH MY TRUCK HAS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM WITHOUT THE AFTERMARKET CONVEX MIRRORS IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES ALONGSIDE OF THE VEHICLE
LOVE THE HEADLIGHTS LED HEADLIGHTS
FOG LIGHTS SHOULD BE LED TO MATCH HEADLIGHT COLOR
NO BLIND SPOTS THAT I KNOW OF IT HAS THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
THERE SEEMS TO BE QUITE A FEW BLIND SPOTS WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES OR WHEN LOOKING RIGHT FOR TRAFFIC WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A LEFT HAND TURN WHEN MAKING A SHARP TURN I FEEL NERVOUS THAT THE CAR MAY TIP OVER SO I DRIVE SLOWER AROUND TURNS WHEN I
VISIBILITY TO THE REAR RIGHT FROM THE PASSENGER SIDE IS VERY POOR
I INJOY THE 360 DEGREE CAMERA AND ALL OF THE TECHNOLOGY PERTAINING TO SAFTEY THE FORD HAS TO OFFER
TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDE OF VEHICLE MY 2002 F250 WAS MUCH BETTER
I REALLY DON T FEEL THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ANYWHERE
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DRIVE WITHOUT BACKUP CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT RADAR
I LOVE THAT IF YOU TURN THE FOG LIGHTS ON THEY STAY ON EVERY TIME YOU USE THE HEADLIGHTS IE I LOVE THAT EVERYTIME I HAVE THE HEADLIGHTS ON I DON T HAVE TO TURN THE FOG LIGHTS ON EVERYTIME AS WELL BECAUSE I ALWAYS USE MY FOG LIGHTS WHEN MY HEAD
SHOULD OFFER FRONT AND REAR CAMERAS ON MORE VEHICLES
BLIND SPOT DUE TO REAR VIEW MIRROR ON PASSENGER SIDE
NEED FORWARD OR FRONT CAMERA WHEN PARKING LIKE THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE FRONT CAMERA
IT S A FULL SIZED TRUCK SO I DO UNDERSTAND VISIBILITY LIMITATION CHALLENGES ALL IN ALL I THINK FORD HAS DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THIS REDESIGN AND CONSIDERING NUMEROUS ASPECTS
VISIBILITY FROM THIS LARGE TALL VEHICLE IS EXCELLENT
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE AND REALLY COOL TOO
THE REDESIGNED WINDOWS GREATLY IMPROVE VISIBILITY
WARNING SYSTEM HAS BEEN GREAT
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE HEADLIGHTS WERE A TAD BRIGHTER ALSO THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN FOG LIGHT AND HEADLIGHT COVERAGE
THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS REALLY HELP
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS AND THE REAR WINDOW IS RATHER SMALLISH
AS WITH MOST CREW CAB PICKUPS THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES HOWEVER THE BLIND SPOT MONOTERING SYSTEM ON MY NEW TRUCK IS WONDERFUL
LOVE THE VISIBILITY AND FEELING OF SAFETY IN A CREW CAB
MORE BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE THAN I EXPERIENCED IN MY LAST CAR
I FIND THE BLIND SPOT IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM VERY HELPFUL IT PROVIDES ADDED REASSURANCE THAT IT S SAFE TO CHANGE LANES WHILE DRIVING THE DOOR MOUNTED MIRRORS ARE LARGE AND PROVIDE A GOOD VIEW AROUND THE TRUCK THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE WONDERFUL
I REALLY LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS IT HELPS A LOT FOR CHANGING LANES
LOVE THE SPLIT MORROW FOR BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOT ARE SO BAD AND AT NIGHT IT SEEMS TO GET EVEN HARDER BECAUSE YOU CANT EVEN SEE THE LIGHTS OF THE OTHER VICHELS BECAUSE OF BLIND SPOTS
THE REAR ROOF LINE IS ANGLED IN A WAY THAT RESTRICTS VISIBILITY IT S LIKE YOU CAN ONLY SEE AT A DOWNWARD ANGLE
FORWARD VISIBILITY IS SUPER
I DO NOT LIKE THE VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT OUT THE REAR WINDOW WHEN THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS ARE UPRIGHT
THE ONLY REAL ISSUES WITH VISIBILITY IS THAT THE VISORS ARE SMALL WITH NO SLIDING FEATURE SO THEY DON T BLOCK AS MUCH AS OTHERS AND THE FRONT END HAS ONE OF THOSE DROP OFF HOODS THAT MAKE TELLING HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO SOMETHING IN FRONT OF YOU A
THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS HELP TO ELIMINATE BLIND SPOTS
HEIGHT OF VEHICLE GIVES EXCEPTIONAL FORWARD VISIBILITY AND WINDOW DESIGNS CREATE EASY VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT WHEN CHANGING LANES IS VERY POOR
REALLY NEEDS THE BU CAMERA FOR GOING BWARD
IT HAS A BAD BLIND SPOT WHEN TURNING LEFT
I WISH THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS HAD THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON IT LIKE THE FORD FUSIONS
LOOKING OVER MY LEFT SHOULDER WHEN CHANGING LANES IS POOR THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT AREA I COULDN T TELL WHEN I WAS TEST DRIVING BECAUSE PRICE STICKER BLOCKED THE ENTIRE WINDOW
WOULD REALLY BENEFIT BY HAVING THE SYSTEM TO HELP WITH BLIND SPOT MONITORING COULD BENEFIT BY LARGER VISORS
I REALLY HAVE TO LOOK CLOSELY WHEN BACKING UP BECAUSE OF BLIND SPOTS
THE EXTERIOR STYLING DRIVES THE BLIND SPOT ISSUE IT S A TRADE OFF
SMALLER REAR WINDOWS AND ROOFLINE CREATE BLINDSPOT
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVER SIDE TO THE LEFT IF A CAR IS PASSING ON THE LEFT OF DRIVING ON THE LEFT IF THEY ARE BY THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW NEITHER MIRROR WILL SHOW THEY ARE THERE
EVEN THOUGH SIDE MIRRORS ARE SIZEABLE THERE STILL IS A BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE
THE REAR GLASS SLIGHTLY WARPS THE VIEW OF VEHICLES BEHIND YOU AT ABOUT 20 YARDS AWAY AS A RESULT WHEN LOOKING BACK VIA THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND THROUGH THE REAR GLASS SOME CARS AT AROUND 20 YARDS BEHIND LOOK SQUISHED AS THEY GET CLOSER THE
VISIBILITY WHILE CHANGING LANES CAN BE DIFFICULT BLIND SPOTS PREVALENT
NO ADJUSTING MY REAR VIEW MIRRORS IS EASY AS PIE
THERE IS A BIG BLIND SPOT IN FRONT OF TJE CAR ON TJE SIDES OF THE WINDSHIELD
REAR WINDSHIELD WIPERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO STAY ON AT A MEDIUM LOW SPEED INSTEAD OF JUST BEING ABLE TO BE ON INTERMITTENTLY AS THEY NOW ARE
I FIND THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY IS LIMITED WHICH ALSO LIMITS VISIBILITY OF CARS APPROACHING FROM REAR ALSO THE REAR WINDOW WINDSHIELD WIPER COVERAGE IS EXTREMELY SMALL NEED LARGER AREA TO BE WIPED
THE A PILLAR IS THICK AND CAUSE BLIND SPOT WHEN GOING ACROSS TRAFFIC
THE FORWARD COLLISION SYSTEM WHICH AUTOMATICALLY BRAKES FOR YOU IS A BIT OVER SENSITIVE AND CAN BRAKE WHEN YOU ARE NOT IN DANGER
THE REAR VISION CAMERA IS IN A POOR SPOT AND IS ALWAYS DIRTY AND IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE OUT OF
THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO LESSEN THE BLIND SPOTS I FEAR I MAY HIT INTO SOMEONE ON THE HIGHWAY THE HOOD SEEMS TO BE TOO HIGH AND LONG AND MAKES IT HARD TO TELL IF I M ALL THE WAY IN A SPACE OR STICKING OUT TOO MUCH
BEST VEHICLE I HAVE EVER OWNED FOR VISIBILITY
HAS SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS
IF NOT FOR REAR VIEW CAMERA I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OUT OF REAR WINDOW TO PARALLEL PARK
THE SHOULDER HARNESS FOR THE MIDDLE POSITION IN THE THIRD ROW SEAT IS A DISTRACTION SINCE IT IS CLEARLY VISIBLE IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
WHEN TURNING AT NIGHT PILLER HOLDING WINDSHIELD HAS BLIND SPOT THAT HEADLAMPS DOES NOT ILLUMINATE ADAQUADITLY
TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIND THE BLIND SPOTS AND ADJUST THE MIRRORS TO SOLVE IT
I ONLY RATE IT HIGH BECAUSE I HAVE THE ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE BELOW AVERAGE FOR FEELING OF SAFETY AND OVERALL RATING
BLIND SPOT WHERE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR & WINDSHIELD MEET
POOR VISIBILITY MAINLY LOOKING FORWARD THE REAR VIEW MIRROR CREATES A HUGE BLIND SPOT AS DOES THE FRONT POSTS
I PREVIOUSLY STATED ABOUT THE REAR VISIBILITY BEING A BIT POOR>
IT DOES HAVE A BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER S SIDE
AUTOMATIC DIMMING HEADLIGHTS ARE THE BEST
I PREFER THE LITTLE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS RATHER THEN THE AUTOMATIC BLIND SPOT LIGHT
THERE ARE ALWAYS BLIND SPOTS WITH ANY VEHICLE PERHAPS THE LITTLE ROUND MIRRORS THAT TAKE CARE OF THAT PROBLEM SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT I ALWAYS BUY SOME FROM AUTO ZONE AND STICK THEM ON MY MIRRORS
BLIND SPOT IS A TOUGH AREA AS ALWAYS BUT SEEMS TO BE BIGGER IN A BIGGER VEHICLE
I M VERY USED TO LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER AND NOT DEPENDING ON THE MIRROR BLIND SPOT THING AND IT NOT AS EASY AS MY OLD ONE TO SEE BEHIND ME
TALL HEADRESTS BLOCK VISIBILITY AND WINDOWS ARE TOO SMALL
THE BLIS MONITORING IS AMAZING WILL NEVER HAVE A CAR WITHOUT IT AGAIN
THE BLISS IS WONDERFUL WHEN DRIVING IN TRAFFIC YOU DON T HAVE TO SECOND GUESS IF YOU CAN CHANGE LANES OR NOT AND THE BACK UP CAMERA GIVES A GREAT VIEW WHEN BACKING UP AND THE CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT IS GREAT IF YOU ARE IN A TIGHT SPOT WHERE YOU CAN T
WISH IT WAS EASIER TO PHYSICALLY SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW KINDA NARROW BACK THERE ESPECIALLY THROUGH SMALLER REAR VIEW MIRROR
VEHICLE IS VERY COMPETENT ON THE ROAD AWD HELPS IN THE SNOW HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE OVERALL GOOD VISIBILITY AROUND THE VEHICLE
DOESN T HAVE RAIN ACTIVATED WINDSHIELD WIPERS
I LIKE HOW IT HANDLES DRIVES IT S A SOLID CAR I M SHORT SO I WOULD LIKE BIGGER WINDOWS ON THE SIDES THE SIDE MIRRORS DOES GIVE A BLIND SIDE
NEW LED HEADLIGHTS ARE VERY DIM ON SIDE STREETS ESPECIALLY I FIND MYSELF PUTTING ON THE BRIGHTS EVERY CHANCE I GET AND THEY ARE NOT THAT BRIGHT ON THE OPEN HIGHWAY LATE AT NIGHT POOR LIGHTING
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS CHATTER AT LOW SETTINGS WITH MINIMAL RAIN MOISTURE
MAKE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ADJUSTABLE INDEPENDENT OF THE REST OF THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR
REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY WHEN BACKING IS LIMITED THE REAR CAMERA HELPS BUT PRIMARILY DIRECTLY BEHIND THE VEHICLE THE WINDOWS COULD BE LONGER THE PASSENGER HEAD REST AND DOOR POST ALSO SEEM TO IMPEDE LINES OF VIEW MY MODEL DOESN
IT SHOULD HAVE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTORS INSTALLED IN THE VEHICLE
REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT SPECIFICALLY THE ABILITY TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES ON THE DRIVERS SIDE THE MIDDLE CABIN PILLAR BLOCKS SOME OF THE VIEW WHEN LOOKING OVER THE SHOULDER THE SMALL MIRROR ABOVE LEFT CORNER OF SI
I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER VEHICLE IF IT DOES NOT HAVE A REAR VIEW CAMERA LOVE IT
THE BACKUP CAMERA WORKS GREAT ESPECIALLY WHEN CONNECTING TO A TRAILER
XENON LIGHTS WOULD BE A NICE OPTION OR REALLY SHOULD BE MADE STANDARD
I FEEL SO SAFE IN THIS CAR IT IS A LITTLE HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW WHEN BACKING UP BUT THAT S WHY I LOVE THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA I DON T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT IT
I LIVE IN A WINTER CLIMATE FOR HALF OF THE YEAR THE RESTING POSITION OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON THE WINDSHIELD ALLOWS FOR ICE BUILD UP IN BETWEEN USE AND DURING INTERMITTENCE THE WINDSHIELD WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY FROM A HEATING ELEMENT IMBEDDED
WE LIKE THE OUTSIDE CAMERA WHEN TURNING RIGHT ON OUR ACCORD ADD THAT
WITH REGARDS TO GMC CANYON S VISIBILITY AND SAFETY OF CONTROLS I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THE 4WD SELECTOR KNOB I SENT AND EMAIL GMC CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH NO RESPONSE THE KNOB ITSELF FUNCTIONS BEAUTIFULLY HOWEVER IT IS A BAD LOCATION TO THE LEF
HEADLIGHTS COULD USE IMPROVING THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR BUILT IN THE DRIVERS MIRROR IS CRAP I HAD A ROUND STICK ON ONE ON MY LAST TRUCK THAT COST A DOLLAR AND IT DID A BETTER JOB IT WOULD WORK BETTER IF IT WERE ADJUSTABLE OR ON LIKE A PIVOT
GOOD VISIBILITY
BACK UP CAMERA IS A MUST WITH THIS VEHICLE IN BAD WEATHER AND DARKNESS CAMERA GETS BLURRY AND MAKES FOR DIFFICULT BACKUPS
THE DEALER INSTALLED A DVD SYSTEM IN THE VEHICLE FOR US SINCE THEY SAID THAT GMC DOESN T PROVIDE THEM AS OFTEN ANYMORE PRE INSTALLED WE WERE NOT INFORMED PROPERLY THAT WHEN THE DVD WAS IN OPERATION IT WOULD COMPLETELY OBSTRUCT THE BACK WINDOW WE
THE SMALL INSERT IN THE DRIVERS MIRROR COULD BE A BIT LARGER I HAD LARGER CURVED MIRRORS ON MY FORD TRUCK AND FELT IT GAVE ME BETTER VIEW ON EACH SIDE OF THE VEHICLE MOST IMPORTANT ON DRIVERS SIDE AS THE RH MIRROR DOES A GOOD JOB
A SWITCHABLE CAMERA ON THE FRONT TO AID PARKING WOULD BE A BIG ASSET THE HIGH HOOD MASKES IT DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHERE THE FRONT BUMPER IS
A LEVEL VEHICLE WOULD ALLOW BETTER REAR VIEW
NEEDS A CAMERA ON THE SIDE MIRRORS THAT TURNS ON WHEN YOU TURN ON THE TURN SIGNAL
OVERALL VEHICLE HAS GREAT VISIBILITY BUT TRUCK TEND TO HAVE BIG BLIND SPOTS THAT AS A DRIVER NEED TO BE AWARE OF
VISIBILITY SEEMS TO BE REALLY GREAT IN THIS TRUCK THE FOG LAMPS ARE EXCELLENT ALSO APPRECIATE THE BLIND SPOT REAR VIEW MIRROR ON THE DRIVER SIDE
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A MORE POWERFUL HEADLIGHT BULB EXTREMELY SUB PAR TO PREVIOUS GENERATION SIERRA
I BELIEVE THE SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD BE LARGER AND HAVE LARGER DUAL MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE THE TINY LITTLE CONVEX MIRROR IMPOSED ON THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR IS TOO SMALL TO BE EFFECTIVE I LIKE A LARGER SIDE MIRROR LIKE THE FORD S I AM WONDERING
THE LOCATION OF THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE POST SIDE POST AND THE HEIGHT OF THE HOOD ALL PROVIDE FOR SLIGHTLY LESS VISIBILITY THAN IN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE SO I HAVE TO BE MORE CAUTIOUS
WE HAD TO REMOVE THE HEADRESTS FROM THE BACK SEATS AS THEY BLOCKED REAR VISIBILITY QUITE A BIT
TWO MINOR COMPLAINTS ON VISIBILITY THE HIGH PROFILE ON THE HOOD AND THE DOOR MOUNTED MIRRORS THE MIRRORS ESPECIALLY PASSENGER SIDE REQUIRE YOU TO TURN YOUR HEAD SIGNIFICANTLY TO VIEW THEM THEY ARE PLACED TO FAR BACK ON THE DOOR THE OTHER GR
HEADLIGHTS ARE DEFINITELY SUBPAR INSTEAD OF ALL THE TRENDY LED LIGHTS I WOULD MUCH PREFER HID HEADLIGHTS AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT ESPECIALLY ON THE DENALI TRIM LEVEL I PURCHASED
STOCK HEADLIGHTS ARE A MAJOR SAFETY CONCERN
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER IF THE TRUCK HAD BLIND SPOT INDICATOR OPTION
THE ONLY ISSUE I HAVE WITH MY TRUCK HAVING THE TOWING MIRRORS IS THE LACK OF VISIBILITY WHEN PULLING OUT MY WIFE BEING 5 5 SHE HAS TO HAVE THE SEAT RAISED HIGH TO AVOID THAT ISSUE
REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS ARE SEEN IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THIS VEHICLE SITS PERFECTLY ABOVE MOST OTHER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD MAKING FOR HIGH VISIBILITY AT ALL TIMES WITH FEW IF ANY BLIND SPOTS
WOULD LIKE BLIND SPOT ALERTS SPOT MIRROR DOESNT OPEN ENOUGH TO THE WAY I SIT
GM SHOULD CONSIDER USING HID HEADLIGHTS ON THE BIG 3 4 AND 1 TON PICKUPS IF ALLOWED BY LAW HALOGEN HEADLAMPS ARE OLD NEWS AND NOT VERY EFFICIENT
THE INTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR IS PRETTY USELESS
ANTI COLLISION PACKAGES SHOULD ALWAYS INCLUDE BLIND SPOT ALERT WE HAVE FRONT AND BACK COLLISION ALERT LANE CHANGE ALERT BUT NOT BLIND SPOT IT MAKES NO SENSE
BACK UP CAMERAS SHOUL NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF BACK UP WARNING SENSORS THEY PROVIDE TWO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS
I DO A LOT OF RIVING AT NIGHT AND THE VISIBILITY OF THE HEADLIGHTS IS VERY GOOD AND REASSURING
THE VISIBILITY WHILE DRIVING MY NEW GMC SIERRA HD GET BETTER AND BETTER AS I DRIVE IT IT IS AN ADJUSTMENT FROM THE OTHER VEHICLE THAT I DROVE PREVIOUSLY
THE CAMPER MIRRORS ALTHOUGH A NECESSITY BECAUSE I TOW A 5TH WHEEL ALMOST ENTIRELY BLOCK MY SIDE VISION WHEN MAKING TURNS THE MIRROR HOUSING NEEDS VERTICAL ADJUSTMENT CONTROLS PROVISIONS
EVEN AT 6 2 VISIBILITY IN THE FRONT IS LIMITED BY SQUARED OFF FRONT HOOD AND FENDERS
FRONT COLLISION WARNING WILL OCCASIONALLY PICK UP ONCOMING TRAFFIC THAT IS NOT IN MY LANE
I FIND THE A OILLARS TO BE MORE OF AN OBSTRUCTION THAN I NOTICED WITH MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE SUBURBAN I FEEL IT MUST BE THAT THE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL THERE IS A LARGE BLINDSPOT FOR LANE CHANGES
I WOULD LIKE TO ADJUST MY SET HIGHER FOR MORE COMFORT EASE VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD AM NOT ABLE TO DO SO WITHOUT THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE STEERING WHEEL AND BEING TOO CLOSE TO THE CEILING OF THE VEHICLE
LOVE THE ALERT IN SIDE MIRRORS ALERTING YOU TO SOMEONE IN BLIND SPOT
HID HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE STANDARD
THE TAILGATE BAR PARTIALLY BLOCKS REAR VISIBILITY
REAR FACING CAMERA GIVES PROVIDES EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY OF PASSENGER SIDE OF VEHICLE NO BLIND SPOT AT ALL NOT TRUE OF DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT NOTHING PROVIDED FOR VIEW OF DRIVER SIDE NO BETTER OFF THAN I WAS IN MY OLD PICK UP TRUCK
I REALLY LIKE THE LANE DEPARTURE AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE SEAT VIBRATION FUNCTION
SOME REAR VISION PROBLEM WITH HIGHT OF 3 ROW SEATS
BETTER HEADLIGHT IS A MUST THEY STINK
THE FRONT WINDOW FRAME CAN BLOCK AN ONCOMING CAR AND HIDE IN THE BLIND SPOT DON T KNOW HOW YOU CORRECT BUT I HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL I WISH THEY HAD A COMPARTMENT TO PUT SUN GLASSES IN NOT IN THE CONSOLE AND NOT WHERE THEY CAN INTERFERE WIT
IT IS RELATIVELY USELESS TO INSTALL A BACKUP CAMERA WITHOUT THE WARNING SOUND
THERE IS ONE BLIND SPOT AND MY MIRRORS DID NOT COME WITH THE EXTRA SIDE VIEW
THE REAR VIEW FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT TAKES SOME GETTING USED TO AS THERE IS A BAR THAT RUNS THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW I HONESTLY DON T NOTICE IT MUCH NOW THAT I HAVE DRIVEN IT FOR A WHILE BUT I COULD SEE IT SCARING NEW CUSTOMERS A LITTLE BIT
THERE IS A BACK UP CAMERA BUT NO WARNING SYSTEM IT WOULD BE BEST FOR EVERY CAR TO HAVE A WARNING SOUND IF YOU COME TOO CLOSE TO SOMETHING IT IS A LITTLE HARD TO JUDGE EVEN USING THE CAMERA
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THE REAR CAMERA AND THE SIDE CAMERA WERE PRETTY DUMB ON SUCH A SMALL VEHICLE I DRIVE COMMERCIAL TRUCKS REGULARLY BUT AFTER USING THEM I VE FOUND THAT BOTH ARE GREAT OPTIONS AND I USE THEM CONSTANTLY THE SIDE VIEW CAMERA I
I FIND A FEW BLIND SPOTS IN THE VEHICLE
THE POSITION OF THE A POSTS MAKE SOME VISIBILITY DIFFICULT FROM THE DRIVER S POSITION
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER S SIDE IS WORRISOME
I HAD A YUKON AND THE FRONT VISIBILITY ON THE IS A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT DUE TO THE HEIGHT OF THE HOOD VS THE YUKON
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN A CAR IS COMING ALONGSIDE
VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND AT ALL TIMES WHEN DRIVING
DRIVERS REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE A PILLAR POSTS AT THE WINDSHIELD OBSCURE VISIBILITY IN TURNS DUE TO THE STEEPLY RAKED WINDSCREEN THE ELECTRONIC INSTRUMENT DISPLAY IS ALMOST WORTHLESS IN VERY BRIGHT FLORIDA SUNSHINE IN CLOUDY CONDITIONS OR AT NIGHT IT S OK THE GAS MILE
OUTSTANDING VISIBILITY FROM CABIN RIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR CAMERA ACTIVATES DURING RIGHT HAND TURNS MINIMIZING BLIND SPOTS
THE SPLIT LEFT REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A WASTE OF TIME IT WAS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE FIELD OF VIEW BUT IT ADDS NOTHING TO THE ABILITY TO SEE CARS IN THE LEFT BLIND SPOT THE RIGHT REAR CAMERA TURNED ON FROM THE STALK ON THE OTHER HAND IS A GOD S
EVEN WITH THE REAR CAMERA THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS I LOVE THE CAR
BECAUSE OF LONG WHEELBASE RELATIVE TO LENGTH OF CAR BACK END SOMETIMES GOES OVER CURBS I FIND THE BACK UP CAMERA TO BE AWESOME WITH A NICE WIDE ANGLE FOR ANYTHING CROSSING YOUR PATH LIKE VEHICLES GOING PERPENDICULAR TO YOU WHEN BACKING OUT OF
THE OUTWARD VISBILITY IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST POINTS OF THE ACCORD
GREAT VISIBILITY THE ONLY REASON I GAVE THE VEHICLE AN 8 FOR SAFETY IS BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE AND WEIGHT IT S A SMALL LIGHTWEIGHT CAR AIRBAGS ARE NICE WIFE FEELS MUCH SAFER IN HER MERCEDES AND HER 4 RUNNER
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE WHEN CHANGING TO LEFT LANE DOOR JAM IS RIGHT IN YOUR FACE
THE DESIGN OF THE REAR HATCH WITH THE CROSS BAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REAR VIEW IS VERY AWKWARD THAT NEEDS A RE DESIGN TO CLEAR THE OBSTRUCTION
LITTLE BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE BUT NOT BAD
REAR CAMERA GETS DIRTY OR WET AND IS DIFFICULT TO SEE CLEARLY IN BRIGHT SUN OR AT NIGHT BACK UP SENSORS ARE LOW AND DON T HELP FOR HIGH NARROW OBJECTS IN REAR
THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING AND FORWARD COLLISION WARNING ARE VERY SENSITIVE ALMOST TOO MUCH SO I KNOW THEY CAN BE ADJUSTED BUT I HAVEN T TRIED THAT YET SO IT S NOT REALLY A COMPLAINT PER SE I TURNED OFF THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING BECAUSE IT
I LOVE THE REAR CAMERA THIS CONTRIBUTES IMMENSELY TO SAFETY WHEN DRIVING IN REVERSE I ONLY MINOR COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THE RELATIVELY LARGE BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
EVERY CAR SHOULD HAVE AN AUTOMATIC WARNING SYSTEM WHEN CHANGING LANES
CHANGING LANE WARNING SYSTEM WOULD BE NICE ESPECIALLY FOR THE LEFT SIDE
WINDSHIELD PROVIDES A PANORAMIC VIEW AND THE WIPERS MANAGE TO COVER THE VAST AMOUNT OF THE HUGE WINDSHIELD AREA
SIDE MIRRORS COULD BE LONGER OURS IS A COUPE AND THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS HAVE BLIND SPOTS ON OCCASION WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES
LIKE THE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA WHEN RIGHT TURN SIGNAL ON
REAR VIEW VISION IS HORRIBLE COULD NOT MANAGE WITHOUT THE CAMERA
THE VISIBILITY AT MOST TIMES A GOOD FOR ITS SIZE
I LOVE THE THE RIGHT SIDE BLIND SPOT CAMERA IN MY CIVIC I WISH THERE WAS ONE FOR THE LEFT SIDE
LOVE THE RIGHT HAND CAMERA
THE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT
I WISH MY VEHICLE HAD COMPASS AND DRIVER SIDE OUTSIDE MIRROR HAD CAMERA LIKE THE PASSENGER SIDE
A BIT OF CONFUSING ON VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES USING CAMERA VIEW
VEHICLE IS SOLID AND QUIET WELL MADE AND SAFE VISIBILITY IS BEST OF ANY VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED ESPECIALLY WITH THE STANDARD REAR FACING CAMERA WHILE BACKING UP OR CHANGING LANES WITH THE SIDE CAMERA
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A GOOD ADDITION BECAUSE IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK THE FEATURE OF THE CAMERA LOOKING TO THE RIGHT REAR IS ALSO GOOD BUT EVEN WITH THIS FEATURE IT IS OFTEN HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHERE ALL THE TRAFFIC IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE
EXCELLENT FORWARD VISIBILITY FOR A PERSON OF MY HEIGHT 6 5 WHEN CONTRASTED TO STANDARD SEDANS COUPES CAMRY ACCORD CIVIC ETC
THE REAR WINDOW RESTRICTS VISIBILITY
NOT ENOUGH WINDOW THE 1990 HONDA CIVIC WAS MUCH BETTER BUT I HAVEN T SEEN A CAR WITH THAT MUCH VISIBILITY SINCE THEN
REAR WINDOWS ARE LOUSY FOR VIEWING BUT THE SIDE VIEW CAMERA IS GREAT
DRIVERS SIDE SUN VISOR NEEDS AN EXTENSION CAPABILITY
THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE SMALL AND HIGH MAKING IT HARD TO SEE BLINDSPOTS
I LOVE THE BLINDSIDE CAMERA FEATURE REALLY MAKES ME FEEL SAFER
LARGE BLIND SPOT AT LEFT AND RIGHT FWD POSTS ESPECIALLY WHEN TURNING A CURVE TO THE LEFT OR ON THE RIGHT WHEN APPROACHING A STOP OR CROSS TRAFFIC
THERE IS A TINY BLIND SPOT WHERE THE FRONT WINDSHIELD MEETS THE FRAME IT IS NOT TERRIBLE BUT ITS NOT IDEAL EITHER
GOOD VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER S SEAT
LOVE THE RIGHT MIRROR CAMERA WHEN CHANGING LANES
AGAIN I AM SOMEWHAT CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE AUDIO CONTROLS WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THE BUTTONS AND HOW YOU HAVE TO LOOK INTENTLY TO MAKE ANY CHANGES ALSO TO CHANGE ITEMS ON THE TOUCH SCREEN ITSELF
LOVE HOW HIGH THE DRIVERS SEAT CAN GO GIVES GREAT VISIBILITY
WOULD PREFER TO HAVE HID LIGHTS AS AN OPTION THIS CAR REPLACED A 91 MIATA PARTIALLY DUE TO SAFETY CONCERNS FOR DAILY DRIVING
I HAVE THE FIESTA ST WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE SAME OPTIONS AS TITANIUM I THINK THIS MODEL SHOULD HAVE A BACK UP CAMERA WOULD BE AN EXTRA SAFETY FEATURE SHOULD ALSO HAVE BACKUP SENSORS
JUST SEEMS TO HAVE BLIND SPOTS AT TIMES BECAUSE THE PILLARS ARE LARGE AND STURDY FOR SAFETY REASONS
I HAD TO INSTALL A REAR CAMERA AND SENSOR SYSTEM IN THE CAR DUE TO POOR VISIBILITY AT THE REAR
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS AWFUL
LOVE THE REAR CAMERA
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS SQUEAKED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE FIRST RAIN STORM FOR ALMOST 120 MILES I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THEM SINCE
THERE S BLIND SPOT BEHIND THE DOOR DIVIDER AND THE HEADREST I DON T LIKE
I WOULD RATHER HAVE WIPER BLADES THAT MOVE SIDE TO SIDE INSTEAD OF FROM THE INSIDE OUT
BLIND SPOTS ARE REMEDIED WITH MIRRORS AND REAR BACKUP CAMERA
BLIND SPOT LEFT DRIVER S SIDE WHEN DRIVING
REAR BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGE HOWEVER IT S NOT REALLY AN ISSUE
GOO THING THERE IS A REAR BACK UP CAMERA AS THE REAR LEDGE IS TOO HIGH TO SEE OUT WHEN YOU TURN AROUND TO SEE
I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY FORD THIS IS MY FIFTH FORD AND I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THE VEHICLE THERE ARE SO MANY NEW GADGETS I THINK NEW OWNERS SHOULD ATTEND A CLASS ON LEARNING WHERE THINGS ARE TOOK ME A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I
LIKE HAVING FOG LIGHTS
VISIBILITY IS THE NUMBER ONE REASON I CHOSE THE MUSTANG OVER ITS COMPETITOR VEHICLES THE MUSTANG S BLIND SPOTS ARE EXTREMELY SMALL VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS IS FANTASTIC AND THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM HELPS MORE THAN I COULD HAVE IMAGI
WHEN SITTING IN THE DRIVERS SEAT THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD
FRONT VISIBILITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN MOST MUSCLE CARS I HAVE DRIVEN
VEHICLE IS VERY HARD TO SEE OUT OF THERE ARE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS TO THE SIDES AND REAR
AS WITH ALL 2 DOOR PONY CARS THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT THIS IS THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR HAVING THIS STYLE OF VEHICLE CAN T REALLY DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT IT S NOT WHAT I D REALLY CALL A FAULT WITH THE CAR PER SE
YOU CAN NOT SEE OUT OF THE BACK GLASS AT ALL I HAVE TO DEPEND COMPLETLY ON THE CAMERA
BLINDSPOT WARNING SYSTEM SHOULD BE STANDARD WITH WITH THE RECARO SEAT PACKAGE BECAUSE I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT WHEN CHANGING LANES EVEN WITH THE CONVEX SIDE MIRRORS THAT ARE SUPPLIED WITH THE VEHICLE
WINDSHIELD WIPERS COULD WORK BETTER IN THE WINTER THEY FREEZE UP QUITE A BIT AND NEED TO BE CLEAN OF ICE WOULD LIKE A FOG LIGHT OPTION
VISIBILITY IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF YOU IS SLIGHTLY HAMPERED BY A HIGH FLAT HOOD AND IMMEDIATELY TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES BY HIGH DOOR LINES
GREAT OVERALL VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT MIRRORS VERY HELPFUL
THIS CAR IS VERY WELL DESIGNED MINIMAL BLIND SPOTS
REAR VISIBILITY PROBLEMS ARE HELPED BY THE REAR VIEW CAMERA SPOTTER MIRRORS & REVERSE PARK ASSIST
SIDE MIRRORS ARE NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THE VISIBILITY THAT IS NEEDED FOR 360 VISION
THE INCLUDED BLIS SYSTEM IS REQUIRED AS THE BLIND SPOTS CAN BE PRETTY BAD
THE BLIND SPOT ON THE MUSTANG IS BAD I HAVE TO RELY ON THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS A LOT
SPLIT REAR DOORS BLOCK VISIBILITY OF VEHICLES IMMEDIATELY BEHIND
PLEASED WITH VISIBILITY SUN VISOR DOESN T COVER ENOUGH WHEN MOVED TO SIDE WINDOW
DRIVER S SIDE VIABILITY IS DIFFICULT THANK GOODNESS FOR WHAT I CALL MY DUMMY LIGHT WHEN THERE S A CAR IN MY BLIND SPOT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE IF IT S RAINING HARD I HAVE TO RELY ON MY OWN DRIVING AND I CAN T RELY ON THE CAR TO DETECT OTHER
THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON THE EXTERIOR MIRRORS ARE A GREAT ADDITION FOR SAFETY AND VISIBILITY
HAVING THE SAFETY FEATURE ON THE SIDE MIRRORS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN YOUR BLIND SPOT IS A GREAT FEATURE
WHEN BACKING OUT OF SOME PARKING SPACES THERE ARE STILL SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS THESE BLIND SPOTS ARE SMALLER THAN IN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS AS WELL AS OTHER COUPS I HAVE DRIVEN THE BACKUP CAMERA S WIDE VIEW ALSO HELPS WITH THIS PROBLEM
DOES HAVE BLIND SPOTS
I FIND I HAVE A BLIND SPOT SOMETIMES WHEN CHANGING LANES
VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE LED HID LIGHTS
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE AZERA HAD THE FORWARD CRASH AVOIDANCE SYSTEM IN ADDITION TO THE FORWARD CRASH WARNING
TRULY OUTSTANDING I FEEL SECURE AND TRUST THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF MY AZERA WHEN DRIVING
THE REAR WIPERS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS THE FRONT WIPERS
CAR AT THIS PRICE POINT SHOULD COME WHIT HID LIGHTS FROM THE FACTORY
WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES POPPED LOOSE AND STOPPED WORKING ON DRIVET SIDE HAD TO TIGHTEN WITH A SOCKET
WHEN LOOKING FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT OUT THE REAR THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT REAR
I HAD A SANTA FE AND TRULY WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE FACT THAT IT HAD NO BLIND SPOTS AND THE SIZE WAS REASSURING WITH SO MANY LARGE VEHICLES ON THE ROAD THE ACCENT HAS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT AND IT IS VERY SMALL SO MY CONFIDENCE IS NOT AS STRONG
LANE DEPARTURE ASSIST SYSTEM IS NOT AVAILABLE WITH THIS VEHICLE AND SHOULD BE AN OPTION OR STANDARD ON THE EXL TRIM LEVEL
VERY EASY TO SEE BLIND SPOTS
I FEEL VERY SAFE AND LOVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AND RIGHT TURN LANE CAMERA FOR EXTRA VISIBILITY
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WITHIN THE VEHICLE
SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO LARGE AND LOW TO WINDOW SILL BLOCKS VISIBILITY OF CURB LINES WHEN MAKING TIGHT TURNS IN CLOSE QUARTERS FRONT SEAT HEAD RESTS ARE TOO BIG FORE & AFT BLOCKING SIDE VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACES YES I KNOW
VERY GOOD VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY
THIS GENESIS WHO S TRULY SUBSTANTIAL I FEEL COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY SAFETY AS I DRIVE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A HEAVY VEHICLE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BIT MORE POWER IN THE ENGINE
WHILE DRIVING WHEN LOOKING TO THE RIGHT SIDE THE DOOR FRAME NEXT TO THE SIDE MIRROR GETS IN THE WAY OF VISIBILITY
PROVIDING AIR BAGS AND HIGH SEAT BACKS HAS TAKEN AWAY FROM VISION OUT BECAUSE OF INCREASED COLUMN SIZES I DESPERATELY NEED THE BLIND SPOT ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED WINDOW AREA
LOVE THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING ALSO THE BACKUP CAMERA AND AUTO TRUNK OPEN
VISIBILITY OUT REAR WINDOW FROM DIVER SEAT COULD BE BETTER THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALLER THAN SOME COMPETITORS AND HIGH HEAD RESTS IN REAR SEAT BLOCK SOME VISION OUT REAR WINDOW
I BELIEVE THE BACK UP CROSS TRAFFIC WARNING LIGHT HELPED TO AVOID AN ACCIDENT
FACTORY WIPER BLADES ARE TERRIBLE
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AND SAFETY
COULD USE LARGER REAR WINDOW FOR VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK
REAR VIEW CAMERA AND LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEM ARE VERY HELPFUL
VERY HARD TO SEE OUT OF THIS CAR TO THE SIDE OR REAR YOU HAVE TO DEPEND ON MIRRORS AND BACKUP CAMERA NEITHER OF WHICH ARE AS SAFE AS THE HUMAN EYE
I WISH THERE WAS AN AUTO SETTING FOR THE HEAD LIGHTS MY OLD CAR AND I DO MEAN OLD HAD AN AUTO SETTING SO I NEVER HAD TO REMEMBER TO TURN ON MY HEADLIGHTS THAT S ABOUT THE ONLY THING I MISS ALSO THERE IS A NEAT BLIND SPOT MIRROR INSERT
WINDSHIELD WIPERS LEAVE STREAKS
ADD REAR VIEW CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT MONITOR
AFTER ALMOST 3 MONTHS I AM STILL NOT USED TO THE BLIND SPOT WHEN I AM CHANGING LANES
TO REITERATE THE VEHICLE VISIBILITY IS POOR BECAUSE OF THE THICK PILLARS
A PILLARS BLOCK SOME VISIBILITY
THE TOTAL VISIBILITY PACKAGE IS EXCELLENT
DON T LIKE THAT STABILITY CONTROL DEFAULT IS TO BE ENGAGED RATHER THAT DEFAULT TO OFF AND LET DRIVER ENGAGE HAVE SOME LOOSE PAVEMENT SITUATIONS WHERE THE ENGINE RETARD FROM WHEEL SLIP IS DANGEROUS AND DON T WANT TO DISENGAGE THE STABILITY EVERY T
BACK UP CAM IS GREAT AS IS CROSS TRAFFIC ALERTE
HEADLIGHTS TEND TO BE LOW AND THE VISIBILITY LINE IS LOW I LIKE TO SEE EVERYTHING UP AHEAD
IT S HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW WHEN BACKING UP IF IT WASN T FOR THE REAR CAMERA I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT THE CAR THE REAR CAMERA IS AWESOME THOUGH AND THE FRONT WINDOW IS FABULOUS BECAUSE OF THE ANGLE OF THE HOOD THERE IS NO OBSTRUCTI
LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS SEEMS TO HAVE A VERY DEFINITE TOP LIGHT LINE THIS GREATLY REDUCES THE FORWARD VISIBILITY AT NIGHT PARTICULARLY WHEN LEVELING OFF FROM A DOWNHILL ROAD THE COLLECTION OF SAFETY AVAILABLE ON THE GENESIS IS THE BEST IN THIS P
THE HEADS UP DISPLAY IS GREAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOWEVER WHEN WEARING SUNGLASSES
AFTER TEST DRIVING SEVERAL SUVS PRIOR TO BUYING THE SANTA FE VISIBILITY WAS FAR THE BEST IN THIS VEHICLE AT MY HEIGHT OF 5 2
THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC SIGNALS ARE VERY HELPFUL AND MY FAVORITE THING ABOUT THE CAR
HATE THE DUAL SIZED WIPER BLADES ON ALL HYUNDAI VEHICLES
REAR WINDOW LOOKS GOOD BUT ALLOWS FOR LESS VISIBILITY
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT ON THIS VEHICLE
OVERALL HAS VERY SMALL BLIND SPOTS THE HEADLIGHTS ARE EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE
THIS CAR IS THE SAFEST CAR OUT THERE SERIOUSLY HAS SAVED ME AND MY KIDS FROM MANY ACCIDENTS ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE BLIND SPOT I LOVE MY GENESIS
THERE IS A PRETTY BIG BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE BUT THE VEHICLE LANE CHANGING WARNING AND VISUAL QUES ON THE SIDE MIRRORS FIXES THAT
NO BACKUP CAMERA BLIND SPOT IN SIDE MIRRORS
AGAIN REAR VISIBILITY RESTRICTED OUT BACK WINDOW
I M STILL ADJUSTING TO THE VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING IT S DIFFERENT FROM MY LAST VEHICLE MY TOYOTA AVALON
I CAN SEE VERY WELL FROM WITHIN THE CAR I HAVE COMFORT IN ALL 360 DEGREES OF VISIBILITY
SINCE I CANNOT SIT UP AS HIGH AS I WANT THE SEAT ONLY GOES SO HIGH I DO NOT HAVE THE VISIBILITY THAT I WOULD WANT ALSO THE LARGE SIDE MIRRORS OBSTRUCT MY SIDE VISION THERE ARE STILL BLIND SPOTS THAT I NEED TO USE THE WARNING BLIND SPOT INDICAT
WITH THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE ON MY GENESIS I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE
DIFFICULTY SEEING CURBING FROM DRIVER SIDE WHILE TURNING OR PARKING DUE TO OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR SIZE
NEEDS BLIND SPOT AND COLLISION WARNING
V6 GENESIS NEEDS TO HAVE AVAILABLE FACTORY FOG LIGHTS LIKE THE V8 HAS AVAILABLE
THE VARIOUS VEHICLE S ELECTRONIC SAFETY FEATURES ARE SPECIALLY EFFECTIVE BUT NOT INTRUSIVE I WON T BUY A CAR WITHOUT THEM IN THE FUTURE
HEADLIGHTS DON T SHOW WELL AT DISTANCE ALSO HEADLIGHT CONTROL NEEDS TO BE MOVED OFF THE DIRECTIONAL SIGNAL DUE TO THE LIGHTS TURNING OFF WHEN HIGH BEAM LIGHTS ARE TURNED ON AND OFF THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS IF NOT DEADLY
I WISH THAT THE WIPERS WORKED BETTER  ALSO THAT I HAVE TO WIPE THE CAMARA OFF ALL THE TIME TO SEE BETTER TO BACK UP
AFTER YEARS OF NOT HAVING A REAR VIEW CAMERA WHEN BACKING I FOUND MYSELF NOT UTILIZING AT FIRST BUT HAVE BECOME MORE COMFORTABLE RECENTLY WITH NOT HAVING TO TURN MY NECK SO OFTEN WHEN BACKING OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY I STILL TEND TO MAKE SURE WHEN D
I WISH THERE WERE A FISH EYE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR AS THERE IS ON THE DRIVER S SIDE I WOULD LIKE THE ARM REST CONSOLE BETWEEN THE TWO FRONT SEATS TO BE A LITTLE LONGER ESPECIALLY FOR THE PASSENGER S COMFORT
THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE DETECTOR IS WORTHLESS
THE EXTRA SMALLER MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE MAKES VISIBILITY INTO THE BLIND SPOT MUCH BETTER
I AM 70 YEARS OLD I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE DRIVING THIS CAR THE VISIBILITY OF OTHER CARS WHEN CHANGING LANES IS ESPECIALLY REASSURING AS IS THE REAR CAMERA WHEN BACKING OUT OF A SPACE
PASSENGER HEADREST BLOCKS VISIBILITY OF DRIVER
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORK GOOD BUT THEY THROW WATER INTO THE PATH OF THE OTHER ONE ON THE WAY BACK DOWN THE WINDSHIELD ISN T WIPED CLEAN WHEN THE WIPERS COME BACK DOWN THIS HAPPENS EVEN DURING A LIGHT RAIN THEY ALSO MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF NOISE
SIDE MIRRORS ARE SMALL AND WEIRD ANGLED MAKING THEM HARD TO USE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR IN DRIVERS SIDE IS USELESS
BLIND SPOTS FROM FRONT WINDSHIELD FRAME ARE SIGNIFICANT
THE ELECTRONIC SAFETY CONTROLS MAKE ME A SAFER DRIVER
SEE EARLIER COMMENT ABOUT REAR VIEW MIRROR
HID IS A MUST AND THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS ARE REALLY NICE TO HAVE SO YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS
WOULD LIKE TO SEE AUTOMATIC INTERMITTENT WIPER SPEED
HARD TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES OUT THE REAR BACK SIDE WINDOWS BACK UP CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT ON THIS VEHICLE SINCE IT IS SO HARD TO JUDGE THE DISTANCE OUT THAT SMALL BACK WINDOW
THE VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD EXCEPT FOR THE USUAL BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES
THERE IS A BIG BLIND SPOT ON EACH SIDE OF THIS VEHICLE IT SHOULD BE STANDARD TO HAVE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ON ALL VEHICLES VERY DANGEROUS AT TIMES NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE ANOTHER VEHICLE COMING ALONG THE SIDE
THERE ARE LARGE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE FRONT THAT COULD CAUSE A CRASH IF NOT VERY CAREFUL AND ALERT
THERE IS ONE OR TWO BLIND SPOTS MAINLY ON THE PASSENGER SIDE POSSIBLE ANOTHER SMALL MIRROR TO SEE CERTAIN BIKES AND SMALLER CARS ON MY PASSENGER SIDE
THE SMALL WINDOW DEFINITELY HELPS TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES WHEN DRIVING BUT THERE A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE THAT PERHAPS A BETTER MIRROR COULD ALLEVIATE
I LIKE THE LITTLE EXTRA MIRROR ON THE DRIVER SIDE FOR THOSE BLIND SPOTS GREAT FEATURE WISH IT WAS ON THE PASSAGER SIDE AS WELL
VERY POOR REAR VISIBILITY WITHOUT REAR CAMERA
FIRST CONSIDERATION WAS VISIBILITY CHANGING LANES AND REVERSING WITHOUT ELECTRONIC ASSIST USE IT OR LOSE IT MY HYUNDAI HAS SUPERB VISUALS I ALSO OWN A VENZA WHICH ALSO HAS EXCELLENT VISUALS
VISIBILITY CHANGING LANES TO LEFT LANE NOT AS CLEAR AS PREVIOUS VEHICLE HAVE TO DOUBLE AND DOUBLE CHECK
THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON MY SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS A GREAT FEATURE
REAR VISIBILITY NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
IT IS REALLY HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK AND THE BLIND SPOTS ARE BAD
V GOOD BACK UP CAMERA & SCREEN
THE ENTIRE BACK HATCH SHOULD BE GLASS TO ADD VISIBILITY OR TO COMPENSATE FOR THE LACK OF VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE SIDE MIRROS AND THAT WOULD HELP WITH AN ALL AROUND VIEW OF SIDE BLINDSPOT AND REAR
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE JUST AS BAD WITH THIS CAR AS IT IS SITTING IN AN SUV AND YOU CANNOT SEE THE TRAFFIC BEHIND YOU WELL BECAUSE THE REAR HEADRESTS TAKE UP VISUAL SPACE OF THE REAR WINDOW
COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM HAVE READY PREVENTED AT LEAST FIVE POTENTIAL WRECKS
ASIDE FROM USING THE BACKUP CAMERA WHICH I DONT USUALLY DO SIGHTLINES FOR REVERSE AND SIDE VIEWS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS I WOULD LIKE
WOULD BE NICE IF THE HEADLIGHTS WERE ADAPTIVE NICE QUALITY HID THOUGH SOME BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR QUARTER PANELS
THERE IS BLIND SPOTS ON VEHICLE WHEN LOOKING OVER SHOULDER TO CHANGE LANES
BLIND SPOT DRIVER SIDE MIRROR IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE ON THIS CAR
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE DRIVERS SIDE BUT I FIND IT STRANGE THAT THERE IS NONE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE
VISIBILITY IS OUTSTANDING
THE ONLY THING I TRULY DISLIKE AND ACTUALLY FIND DANGEROUS ARE THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS I FIND THAT THEY CREATE A BLINDSPOT WHEN LOOKING AHEAD TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT I VE ALMOST CRASHED ON A FEW OCCASIONS TO TRY TO AVOID ANY ISSUES I LIFTED T
I LIKE THE SAFETY ELECTRONICS
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HEADLIGHT SETTINGS
HEADLIGHTS APPEAR TO BE TOO LOW FOR MY LIKING DISTANCE VISIBILITY IS SHORT
CONSIDERATION TO SAFETY OF ALL BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
SOME TIMES I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TROUBLE SEEING OTHER VEHICLES AS I TURN RIGHT ONTO A STREET LIKE HAVING A BLINDSPOT NOT SURE JUST YET IF ITS ME OR THE CAR JUST A FEELING IM HAVING
I HAVE NOTICED A LARGE BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE LANES QUITE A FEW TIMES I WISH I HAD THE KIND THAT SIGNALED SOMEONE WAS THERE
YOU JUST CANT REALLY SEE AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF THE CAR EVEN WITH REVERSE CAM AND BLIND SPOT MIRROR ITS STILL DIFFICULT
MANY BLIND SPOTS WITH CONER POSTS
SAFETY CONCERNS COME FROM THE TIRE WANDERING
WISH I HAD WARNING LIGHTS ON MY SIDE MIRRORS
IN TERMS OF THE REAR CAMERA THE OPTIONAL VIEWS FORWARD TOP DOWN REAR FULL VIEW ARE FANTASTIC ESPECIALLY FRONT VIEW FOR AVOIDING PARKING LOT HAZARDS TO THE FRONT FASCIA MY ONE QUIBBLE IS A THE CLARITY OF REAR CAMERA IT IS VERY GRAINY A
LED HEADLIGHTS WORK GREAT
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS DUE TO THICKER WINDSHIELD AND SIDE DOOR ROOF SUPPORT RAILS
TOUGH BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES TO THE RIGHT SIDE
POOR VISIBILITY OUT BACK AND SIDES REAR HEADRESTS BLOCK THE VIEW
LEFT DRIVER BLINDSPOT
BACKING UP WOULD BE DIFFICULT IF NOT FOR THE REAR CAMERA HOWEVER THE 360 DEGREE CAMERA SYSTEM AND BACK UP ASSIST ARE TRULY EXCEPTIONAL
THE SIDE MIRRORS BLOCK VISIBILITY WHEN MAKING A TURN ESPECIALLY A LEFT TURN
NO SIDE WARNING FOR CARS IN LANES NEXT TO CAR THIS IS A BIG SAFETY ISSUE FOR ME
HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH REAR HEADRESTS CUTS DOWN ON REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY DARKENED REAR WINDOW ALSO MAKES IT HARD IN RAIN TO SEE CARS ESPECIALLY IF THEY DON T HAVE ON THEIR HEADLIGHTS LOVE THE 4 CAMERAS USE THEM ALL THE TIME FOR PARKI
LARGE MIRRORS ARE EXCELLENT 360 VIEW CAMERAS ARE HELPFUL IN TIGHT PARKING SITUATIONS
WHEN LOOKING OUT REAR SIDE WINDOWS THERE IS A SIZABLE BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO BACK OUT OF A PARKING SPACE
THE SPEEDOMETER IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO READ WHILE DRIVING THE TICKS BETWEEN STATED MILES PER HOUR ALL CLUSTER CLOSE TOGETHER EX 50 MPH HAS ALMOST THE SAME SIZE AS THE TICKS IN BETWEEN I FIND IT A HAZARD FOR DRIVING TO STUDY THE FACE OF
THE HEADRESTS OF THE SECOND ROW SEATS BLOCK THE REAR VIEW MIRROR VISIBILITY
SAFETY WHEN DRIVING IS RELEVANT TO THE ILLUMINATION OF THE WIPER TURN SIGNAL REAR VIEW MIRROR & INTERIOR LIGHTING I HAVE LISTED IN PREVIOUS QUESTIONS
LIKE THE GOOD VISIBILITY IN OUR FIT
IT IS HARD TO SEE BEHIND THE VEHICLE USING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA FEATURE BUT THE CAMERA DIRTIES EASILY IT GETS COVERED WITH SALT EASILY IN WINTRY CONDITIONS MAKING IT VIRTUALLY USELESS THE PASSENGER SIDE CAMERA IS AMA
LANE WATCH CAMERA IS GREAT IT CAN BE TURNED ON WITH A BUTTON I SOMETIMES CARRY FULL LOADS WHERE THE BACK GLASS VISION IS OBSTRUCTED IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO SWITCH TO A CENTER VIEW
THE CAMERAS ARE VERY HARD TO LEARN TO USE THE SIDE CAMERA IS VERY DISAPPOINTING BY THE TIME THE IMAGE APPEARS IT S TOO LATE BUT I LOVE IT FOR PARALLEL PARKING I DON T LIKE THE VISIBILITY OF THE FIT DIDN T REALIZE IT WHEN I TEST DROVE IT TOO
I THINK THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE OF THE FACTORY INSTALLED WIPERS WHEN I CHANGE THE BLADES I BELIEVE THE WIPERSYSTEM WILL BE SUPERIOR
THE SUN VISORS ARE KIND OF SMALL ALSO THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL AND NOT EASY TO SEE OUT OF HOWEVER THE REAR CAMERA IS GREAT WHEN BACKING UP
TINTED WINDOWS SHOULD BE STANDARD AT LEAST THE WINDSHIELD SINCE NOW THE WINDOWS ARE SO LARGE
REALLY IMPRESSED WITH HOW HELPFUL THE CAMERAS AND SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE TO HELP ALLEVIATE BLIND SPOTS THEY ARE ANGLED WELL AND I ENJOY THE WIDE ANGLE PART OF THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR
BLIND SPOTS BY SIDE FRONT DOOR WINDOWS
BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT VIEWER ON THE SCREEN AND THE ABILITY TO TURN ON AND OFF WHILE DRIVING MAKES ME FEEL MORE AWARE ALSO LOVE THE WARNING GIVEN WHEN GETTING TO CLOSE TO VEHICLES IN FRONT
THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR DRIVERS SIDE IS NOT ADEQUATE I ACTUALLY PLACED A STICK ON CONVEX SHAPED MIRROR WHICH GIVES ME FAR BETTER VISIBILITY
THERE IS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT WHEN DRIVER HAS TO LOOK BACK PAST FRONT PASSENGER
SEE PREVIOUS COMMENTS ABOUT HORRIBLE REAR VIEW MIRROR
REAR CAMERA IS VERY HANDY FOR BACKING UP
NOT A FAN OF DRIVER SIDE EXTERIOR MIRROR WISH IT HAD A CAMERA LIKE THE PASSENGER SIDE ONE
GOOD VISIBILITY FORWARD AND SIDE
AGAIN THE ISSUE WITH THE ODD SHAPED SIDE REAR WINDOWS CAUSE ME PAUSE WHEN SWITCHING LANES MAZDA HAS A GREAT FEATURE WITH LED S THAT LIGHT UP WHEN SOMEONE IS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT AND IF YOU TURN ON YOUR TURN SIGNAL WHEN SOMEONE IS IS THE ASSOCIATED
BACK HEADREST PARTIALLY OBSCURE REAR VISION LANE CHANGE DISTRACTION FROM IN DASH CAMERA SOMETIMES USEFUL SOMETIMES A DISTRACTION
REAR VISIBILITY WITH REAR SEAT HEADRESTS RAISED LIMITS REAR VIEW
DRIVER VISIBILITY OF THE HONDA CRV WAS SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER VEHICLES MAZDA CX5 AND RAV4 I HAD CONSIDERED PURCHASING
I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE PURCHASING THIS CAR AND MADE MY CHOICE BASED IN SOME PART ON WHAT EXCELLENT SAFETY RATINGS IT RECEIVED
THERE ARE VERY APPARENT BLIND SPOTS IN THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE WHERE SMALLER WINDOWS HAVE BEEN MADE TO ALLOW FOR SOME VISIBILITY PAST THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AND ALONG EITHER SIDE OF THE HOOD TOWARDS THE NOSE OF THE VEHICLE THE ANGLE SHAPE OF THE
THERE IS A SMALL AREA THAT THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT COVER IN FRONT OF THE FRONT PASSENGER
VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD IN THIS VEHICLE
I VE NEVER BEEN IN A VEHICLE WITH BETTER VISIBILITY FROM THE INSIDE THE WINDOWS ARE VERY INTELLIGENTLY DESIGNED TO ALLOW MAXIMUM VISION OF THE SURROUNDINGS AND THE KIDS LOVE THAT THEY CAN SEE OUT ALSO FARLEY FARLEY FARLEY FARLEY FARLEY HA F
RIGHT REAR VIEW FROM DRIVER S SEAT IS LIMITED BUT CAMERA CCTV SYSTEM IS VERY EFFECTIVE COMPENSATION ONE SUGGESTION MODIFY RIGHT REAR CAMERA MOUNT UNDER RIGHT OUTBOARD MIRROR WITH HOOD EXTENSION TO AVOID PREVENT ACCUMULATION OF VIEW OBSCURING
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SHOULD BE LARGER
NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRY TO ADJUST THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THERE STILL IS A BLIND SPOT
THE WINDOWS SEEM TO BE VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT I LIKE THE ADDITIONAL CUTOUTS UP FRONT AND THE BUILT IN SHADES IN THE MIDDLE THEY BLOCK SUN BUT KEEP VISIBILITY
THE 03 HAD BETTER SIDE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY AND LESS OF A BLIND SPOT
I WOULD LOVE IT IF THEY COULD PUT A FRONT CAMERA THE VISIBILITY TO SEE ANYTHING FROM THE HOOD AND BELOW IS POOR AND THEREFORE MORE LIKELY CAUSING PARKING TO BE DIFFICULT SPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS A POLE THAT IS LOWER THAN THE HOOD
MY PILOT DOES NOT HAVE A WARNING SYSTEM OR ALERT DEALING WITH THE BLINDSPOT IF IT HAD THAT I WOULD HAVE RATED THIS A 10
THIS PILOT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN OUR 2004 WE TRADED IN STILL GETTING USE TO THE SIZE AND THE VISIBILITY OF THE BIGGER VEHICLE
SHOULD HAVE CAMERA WHEN TURNING LIKE THE CROSSTOUR
PERSONAL PREFERENCE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN EXTRA VISIBILITY FEATURES
LARGE BLIND SPOTS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FROM THE REAR PILLARS
THE BAR NEXT TO THE FRONT SMALL TRIANGULAR WINDOWS GETS IN THE WAY CAUSING A BLIND SPOT
CREATE DIFFERENT SOUNDS FOR ALARMS MAKE INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR REAL
LOVE THE CAMERAS LANE DEPARTURE AND COLLISION WARNINGS
VISIBILITY IS LIMITED BY CAR DESIGN STYLING VISION ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR SAFETY WHEN DRIVING
SIDE BOARDS TOO LARGE AFFECTS VISIBILITY BACK WINDOW TOO SMALL
I WISH THE REAR WINDSHIELD WAS BIGGER TO ALLOW FOR BETTER VISIBILITY BEHIND
DRIVER SIDE WINDOW HAS A SMALL BLIND SPOT
HEADLIGHTS ARE GREAT SO BRIGHT MANY DEER AVOIDED SO FAR BLIND SPOTS INCONVENIENT AT BEST
I LOVE MY JEEP BUT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BLIND SPOTS
I DO HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING THE PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT SOMETIMES
THE THICKNESS OF THE FRAME BETWEEN THE DRIVER S SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD AND THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW WHICH MAY BE PART OF THE ROLL CAGE CREATES A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT FOR ANYTHING TO THE FRONT LEFT SIDE OF THE DRIVER I E WHEN GOING AROUND A CURV
ENJOY THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS AND BRIGHT LIGHTS
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS YOU MUST BE AWARE USING ALL MIRRORS AND TURNING YOUR HEAD
THE WINDSHIELD FRAME SEEMS TO LIMIT VISIBILITY THEY SEEM WIDER THAN MOST VEHICLES I VE DRIVEN
A SMALL BLIND SPOT MIRROR BUILT IN LIKE FORD USES WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT
BAD BLIND SPOT DOWN BOTH SIDES OF VEHICLE I HAVE OVER ADJUST SIDE MIRRORS OUTWARD TO SEE NEXT LANE AT REAR CORNERS OF VEHICLE
AT THE PRICE WE PAID FOR THIS VEHICLE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH A BACK UP CAMERA WE HAD TO PURCHASE AN AFTERMARKET BACK UP CAMERA
JEEP HAS COME A LONG WAY AND THEIR LIMITED IS A BEAUTIFUL VEHICLE WITH AN EXCEPTIONAL 507WATT STEREO SYSTEM
LOVE THE AUTO DIMMING HEADLIGHTS
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT LIGHT AND SOUND INDICATORS THE FRONT COLLISION WARNING IS A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE THAT HAS SCARED ME MORE THAN ONCE WHEN I WAS NOWHERE NEAR IN DANGER OF HITTING THE CAR AHEAD OF ME
STILL NEEDED BLIND SPOT MIRRORS FOR LANE CHANGING PASSING ETC HELP WITH THE BLIND SPOT SHOULD BE IN ALL VEHICLES & ALL BRANDS A SAFETY MUST BUT WITH THE ADDITIONAL I PUT ON I FEEL SAFE
I DO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME SEEING MY BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER S SIDE I HAVE TRIED ADJUSTING MIRRORS BUT I CANNOT GET IT IN THE BEST LOCATION BUT I WILL ALSO ADD THAT OVERALL I SEE VERY WELL OUT OF THE VEHICLE AND FEEL SAFE
REAR VIEW MIRROR DISTANCE FROM DRIVER TO FAR SIDEVIEW MIRRORS DO NOT ADJUST FOR SAFETY
THE CAR DOES NOT HAVE BUILT IN BLIND SPOT MIRRORS LIKE MY LAST VEHICLE NOT A HUGE DEAL JUST BOUGHT SOME AND PUT THEM ON MYSELF
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR HIGH BEAMS TAKE TOO MUCH LIGHT AWAY FROM IMMEDIATE ROADWAY SHOULD COMPLIMENT LOW BEAMS INSTEAD OF AND EITHER OR
SERIOUS DRIVERS SIDE BLIND SPOT
REAR WINDOW WIPER RESTRICTS VISION
HUGE BLIND SPOT
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO LOW FOR TALL DRIVERS IT BLOCKS SOME OF THE FORWARD VISIBILITY
REAR WINDOW WIPER ASSEMBLY INTERFERES WITH YOUR VISIBILITY
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES TO SEE AROUND BACK WINDOW SEEMS TO HAVE A BLIND SPOT WHICH I NEED TO GET USED TO
THE WAY THE REAR WIPERS & THIRD BRAKE LIGHT IS POSITIONED THE VISIBILITY THROUGH REAR WINDOW IS POOR
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE VISIBILITY THROUGH THE BACK WINDOW THE SUN VISORS ARE PROBABLE FINE FOR TALL PEOPLE BUT I AM 5FT 2IN AND THE AFTERNOON SUN COMES IN UNDER THE VISOR
HAS GOOD OVERALL VISIBILITY
MY FAMILY AND I ARE AT EASE WITH THE SAFETY QUALITIES OF THIS VEHICLE
REAR CORNER BLIND SPOT
REAR VISIBILITY IS LACKING A FACTORY REAR CAMERA SHOULD BE AN AVAILABLE OPTION OR EVEN STANDARD FOR RUBICON
REAR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING CAN BE POOR AND BACKUP CAMERA HAS TO BE RELIED ON TOO MUCH
ALTHOUGH THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS ARE THE SAME SIZE ANS MY LAST WRANGLER THERE SEEM TO BE MORE BLIND SPOTS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS TO BE SMALLER AS WELL AND HAS MORE BLIND SPOTS THAN THE MODEL
I WISH I GOT THE REAR VIEW CAMERA FOR BACKING UP
OPTIONAL REAR VIEW CAMERA EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET ACTIVATED STAFF HAVE LITTLE KNOWLEDGE OF STARSCAN ONE QUOTE WAS 700 00 TO ACTIVATE
THE BAR BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND FRONT SIDE WINDER IS TOO FAT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHILE TURNING
I DON T LIKE THE 2 LAYERS OF HEADLIGHT FROM DIM TO BRIGHT
THE SPARE TIRE AND REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS PROVIDE BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING
DRIVER SITS TOO LOW AND THE BLIND SPOTS ARE TOO LARGE JUST LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDSHIELD THE ROOF SUPPORT CONSTRUCTION IS TOO WIDE IN THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE MAKING IF VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT IS JUST OFF TO THE SIDE SUN VISORS SHOULD BE DE
CENTER POSTS BETWEEN DRIVER AND BACK SEAT CREATE BLIND SPOTS
IMPROVE THE BLIND SPOT VISION
THE BAR BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE DRIVER DOOR IS ALWAYS A BLIND SPOT FOR ME I ALSO SHOULD USE A BLIND SPOT MIRROR BECAUSE I HAVE TO TURN AROUND TO SEE IF ANYONE IS IN THE NEXT LANE
I LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA MY OLD KIA HAD A PART IN THE SUN VISOR THAT CAME OUT TO MAKE IT LONGER BRING IT BACK
ITS NO PROBLEM WITH MY VEHICLES VISIBLITY HOWEVER AS FAR AS DRIVING SAFETY ONLY WHEN I TURN CAR I DON T WANT THE WHEEL TO END UP COMING OFF IF I HARD TURN THE CAR IF NEEDED I USUALLY DON T HAVE TO MAKE TURNS BUT WHEN I EXPERIENCE THE MISALIGNMEN
THE STEERING WHEEL FOLLOWING BACK UP CAMERA IS SUPERIOR TO ANY VEHICLE I VE SEEN   HEARD OF
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS MISSES A SMALL PORTION OF THE PASSENGERS WINDSHIELD NEAR THE BOTTOM THIS IS A DESIGN PROBLEM
I WISH IT HAD BLIND SPOT WARNING
PASSENGER S HEADREST AND FRAME OF WINDSHIELD DOOR CREATE BLIND SPOTS BACK UP CAMERA DISPLAY NOT DISTINCT AT ALL TIMES THE CAMERA EYE CAN BE DIRTY OR WATER SPOT
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON BOTH SIDES IN ADDITION WE DON T LIKE HOW THE FRONT WINDOW IS DESIGNED THE FRONT WINDOW IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH AS THE VISOR SECTION IS TOO LOW MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE REDLIGHTS ETC IN ADDITION THE BACK HEADRESTS SEEM T
LEFT AND RIGHT FRONT WINDSHIELD PILLARS ARE BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOT LOOKING A RIGHT CORNER FROM DRIVER S SEAT
AIRBAG RECALL R05 I AM HAPPY THIS WAS BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION SOONER THAN LATER
BLIND SPOT IS A BIT LARGE
HAD TO INSTALL BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES IN BLIND SPOT EVEN WHEN TURNING TO LOOK
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE HARD TO CHECK BY LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT I AM 5 2 WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO SEE OUT THE BACK AND OVER MY SHOULDERS WHILE CHANGING LANES
VEHICLE S VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY IS GOOD
I FEEL LIKE IT CAME EQUIPPED WITH THE CHEAPEST WIPER BLADES POSSIBLE AND THEY NEEDED TO BE REPLACES RIGHT AWAY ALSO THE BLIND SPOT LOOKING OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER MAKES ME NERVOUS
SEEMS TO HAVE LARGER BLIND SPOTS THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR A HONDA ACCORD
POOR VISABILITY LOOKING OUT WINDSHIELD DASH IS TOO HIGH
EASY TO SEE EVERYTHING AND WE LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA
C PILLAR CREATES BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT SIDE OF CAR
WHEN TURNING THE HEAD TO LOOK BACK THE REAR CORNERS VISIBILITY IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED
3D ROW SIDE WINDOWS ARE TOO NARROW OLDER SEDONA HAD A WIDER SIDE BACK WINDOWS BETTER VISIBILITY BACK WINDOW OF NEW SEDONA IS TOO NARROW TOO
HARD TO SEE AT NIGHT BACKING UP EVEN WITH THE CAMERA
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT BETWEEN THE A PILLAR IN THE CORNERS WHILE LOOKING OUT THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE I ASSUME THE FRONT WARING SYSTEM WOULD SOUND IF THERE WAS AN ISSUE CLOSE BY
VERY NICE VISIBILITY I AM ENJOYING MY NEW SORRENTO
LOVE THE LANE CHANGE ASSISTANCE AND BACKUP CAMERA
2ND ROW HEADRESTS SGHOULD FOLD DOWN WHEN NOT IN USE WHICH IMPROVES REAR VISIBILITY
LOVING BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND REALLY ENJOY THE AWESOME NAVIGATION MONITOR FOR REAR CAMERA
UNSURE OF SAFETY
LOVE THE AMOUNT OF AIRBAGS
I LOVE THE FRONT AND REAR VIEW CAMERAS ESPECIALLY THE BIRDS EYE VIEW
ALL AROUND VISIBILITY IS GREAT WHICH COMBINED WITH THE CAR S RESPONSIVENESS MAKES FOR A SAFE DRIVING ENVIRONMENT
SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD BE ABLE TO VIEW BLIND SPOTS FOR ADDED SAFETY AS A STANDARD
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS VEHICLE COME STANDARD WITH BLIND SPOT MONITORING COLLISION AVOIDANCE ALERT SYSTEM AND OR LANE DEPARTURE WARNING
BACKING UP WHILE I HAVE THE CAMERA IT WAS NOT REALIZED UNTIL AFTER I PURCHASED THAT THE ELECTRONIC SENSORS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS MODEL AND ALMOST HIT SOMETHING EXPECTING NOTIFICATION BY SOUND
I HAVE NEVER FELT SAFER IN ANY VEHICLE THAN THIS ONE INCREDIBLY EQUIPPED WITH SAFETY FEATURES
BACK UP COLLISION SYSTEM AS WELL AS BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTME IS WONDERFUL THESE SHOULD BE STANDARD ON MOST VEHICLES
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURES ADDED FOR A VEHICLE AT THIS PRICE POINT
WHEN I AM DRIVING THE VEHICLE AND NEED TO LOOK TO THE REAR ON THE RIGHT SIDE THERE IS A BLIND SPOT THAT YOU CAN T SEE WHEN YIELDING
THE MANEUVERABILITY OF THE VEHICLE AND THE POWER FROM THE ENGINE MAKE ME CONFIDENT THAT I WILL BE EASILY ABLE TO AVOID SITUATIONS THAT MIGHT COMPROMISE SAFETY
THE ADDITION OF A HEAD UP DISPLAY WOULD PROVIDE ADDITION SAFETY
REAR VISIBILITY ISN T GREAT
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM REAR CAMERA GUIDELINES ARE OUTSTANDING
I HAVE A FEW VERY BAD BLIND SPOTS
POOR PASSENGER REAR SIDE WINDOW VISIBILITY
THE VEHICLE HAS VERY GOOD VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT AND DOES NOT FEEL LIKE A LARGE VEHICLE
THE SIDE MIRRORS DO CREATE A BLIND SPOT FOR ME THE HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT AS BRIGHT AS MY HUSBAND S G35
IT IS A VERY COMFORTABLE CAR TO DRIVE NO BLIND SPOTS
FOR SAFETY PURPOSES THE CAR SHOULD HAVE SIDE AND FRONT SENSORS WHEN THE CAR IS TO CLOSE TO OTHER VEHICLES OR OBJECTS
THE VEHICLE HAS A BIG BLIND SPOT WHICH IS A CONCERN BUT CAN BE GOTTEN USED TO AND ADJUSTED AFTER SOME DRIVING OF VEHICLE
REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT IS LIMITED WHEN THIRD ROW SEATS ARE UP
DOOR POSTS ARE WIDE AND PRESENT VISIBILITY ISSUE WHEN LOOKING 120 DEGREES BACKWARDS FRO DRIVERS SEAT OTHER WISE VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT IS EXCELLENT
THERE ARE NOT YET CRASH TEST RATINGS WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE
THE VISIBILITY FROM INSIDE THE LR4 IS AMAZING YOU DON T REALIZE HOW MUCH IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE UNTIL YOU DRIVE ANOTHER VEHICLE AFTERWARDS
GOOD VISIBILITY IS WHY I BOUGHT THIS CAR
A HEADS UP DISPLAY WAS NOT AVAILABLE FOR MY MODEL CYCLE WHICH I WOULD HAVE LIKED MY BMW HAS ONE AND ITS GREAT
BACKUP CAMERA IS BLURRY DIFFICULT TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES
DRIVING POSITION IS REALLY EXCELLENT TO BE ABLE TO SEE AROUND THE VEHICLE
FAIRLY MEANINGFUL BLIND SPOTS WHEN ATTEMPTING TO LOOK BACK AND TO THE RIGHT SIDE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE SECOND ROW HEAD RESTS
SO FAR THE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT
WINDSHIELD WIPERS SPRAY WATER THAT DOESN T GET COMPLETELY OUT OF VISION
THE REAR VISIBILITY ISN T GREAT BUT COMING FROM A CONVERTIBLE IT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT I WAS USED TO THIS IS NOT A DETRACTION FOR ME BECAUSE OF THE EXCELLENT CAMERA SYSTEM WHICH IS BETTER THAN ANY AMOUNT OF REAR VISIBILITY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN
THE VISORS ARE REALLY TOO SMALL BUT UNDERSTAND IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST IT COULD BE FOR THE SIZE OF THE VEHICLE THE REAR VISIBILITY IS SOMETIMES DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE VEHICLE IS MADE I HAVE TO MAKE SURE I AM POSITIONED PROPERLY TO VIEW
THERE IS A LEARNING CURVE FOR REAR VISIBILITY AS WITH ANY OTHER NEW VEHICLE I HAVE HAD THE REAR VISIBILITY IS MORE LIKE A SEDAN THAN AN SUV
BACK CORNER BLIND SPOTS
REMARKABLE VISIBILITY DESPITE IT S COMPACT SIZE
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT SENSORS IN THE MIRRORS
BACK HEADRESTS COULD FOLD UP DOWN FOR BETTER VISIBILITY OUT REAR WINDOW
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE A BIT OBSTRUCTIVE BUT NOT TOO WORRISOME
REAR HEADRESTS PARTIALLY OBSTRUCT VIEW OUT REAR WINDOW HOWEVER VISIBILITY IS ADEQUATE ESPECIALLY WITH LARGE REAR VIEW MIRRORS AND WARNING SYSTEMS
BLIND SPOT SHOULD BE STANDARD IN EVERY LEXUS
THE DRIVER NEEDS TO CHECK THE RIGHT HAND BLIND SPOT IS ALL I CAN THINK OF
I MISS VEHICLE ALERT SYSTEM I HAD IN MY PREVIOUS CAR WHICH WAS A MERCEDES BENZ
THE REAR WINDOW IS SMALL AND THE IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER SIDE
THERE IS A REALLY BAD BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO GET OVER TO THE RIGHT OR THE LEFT I HAVE TO REALLY MOVE MY HEAD BACK AND FORTH TO DOUBLE   TRIPLE CHECK BEFORE GETTING OVER EITHER DIRECTION
REAR VIEW TAKES SOME GETTING USE TOO THRU REAR INSIDE MIRROR NO BIG PROBLEM THOUGH
ALTHOUGH I LOVE THE SLEEK BODY STYLE OF THIS VEHICLE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND OF CHANGE SOMEHOW WITHOUT MESSING UP THE STYLE IN THE REAR WINDSHIELD AS FAR AS VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER SEAT IF THERE S NO WAY OF DEALING WITH THAT THEN JUST
I THINK THE VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN MY IS250
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT THE FACTORY WIPER BLADES THEY ARE HORRENDOUSLY BAD IN SNOW ICY CONDITIONS THE REAR WINDSHIELD DEFROSTER SHOULD BE BETTER DURING COLD SNOWY CONDITIONS WHEN PASSENGERS ARE IN THE BACK REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE SUBJECT
VISIBILITY IS AN ISSUE THAT WILL IMPACT MY DECISION TO KEEP THIS CAR
I AM SHORT AND OFTEN HAVE VISIBILITY ISSUES IN OTHER VEHICLES THE SEATS ADJUST SO I CAN REALLY SEE WELL THE BACK UP CAMERA IS REALLY FABULOUS GIVING A VERY WIDE VIEW BEHIND MY VEHICLE THE SIDES MIRRORS ARE VERY EASY TO SEE AND THE BLIND SPOT
NO THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE SUN VISORS IS THAT WHEN THE SUN IS COMING IN RIGHT BEHIND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR YOU CAN T BLOCK IT
I WILL IT HAD BLIND SPOT ASSISTANCE
BECAUSE I AM SO SHORT 5 AND SHORT WAISTED I HAVE TO SET MY SEAT AT MAXIMUM HEIGHT AND STILL HAVE LIMITED VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD IMMEDIATELY AROUND MY CAR I AM ALWAYS UNEASY WHEN I DRIVE
EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY ALL AROUND
VISIBILITY THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW IS VERY LIMITED
THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT THRU THE BACK WINDOW SEEMS VERY DARK MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO SEE FOLLOWING VEHICLES
VERY GOOD TURNING RADIUS NIGHT DRIVING REAR VIEW WINDOW LINES HAVE LIGHT REFLECTIONS
VISIBILITY TO MAKE TURNS
THE DYNAMIC CRUISE CONTROL FEATURE IS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE AND HELPFUL
LOVE THE WARNING SYSTEM FOR CHANGING LANES
REAR BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGE
VERY LITTLE BLIND SPOT AND SAFETY LIGHTS TO DETECT WHEN SOMEONE IS IN BLIND SPOT ARE GREAT
I LOVE THE WARNING LIGHTS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS THAT SHOW IF ANOTHER VEHICLE IS TOO CLOSE
ELECTRONIC BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CAN BE HARD TO DETECT MANUALLY
BLIND SPOT WARNINGS ON THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE GREAT
WITH A SOMEWHAT QUICK PULL OF WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID SPRAY THE WIPERS DO NOT FOLLOW WITH A WIPE IF YOU PULL FOR WHAT I THINK TO BE A MUCH LONGER THAN NEEDED PULL THE WIPERS WILL WIPE JUST ONCE I ALWAYS NEED TO MANUALLY ENGAGE THE WIPERS AFTER
IT IS REALY GOOD THE BEST PART I LIKE IN THIS CAR IS THE SAFETY
THE REAR WIPER SHOULD COVER MOR AREA
REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE
BLINDSPOT TO PASSENGER REAR IS HUGE ENOUGH TO HIDE AN 18 WHEELER
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BACK UP NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE BEFORE WITH ANY OTHER CAR EVEN THOUGH THIS ONE HAS A REAR CAMERA I BELIEVE THE LOCATION AND DESIGN OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR GIVES YOU THE SENSE OF WRONG ANGLE WHEN BACKING UP
WISH IT HAD WARNING SYSTEM FOR BLIND SPOT
IT NEEDS A BLIND SPOT MONITOR
OVERALL I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THE VEHICLE WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF SNOW ICE THIS WINTER AFTER FINALLY FIGURING OUT THE HEATED WINDSHIELD WIPERS THEY WORK GREAT WITHOUT THEM THE WIPERS ONLY DID AN ADEQUATE JOB OF CLEARING SNOW ICE
REAR DEFROSTERS COULD WORK BETTER REAR WIPER COULD BE LARGER
I HATE THE TINTED WINDOWS I M NIGHT BLIND AND THESE MAKE NIGHT DRIVING DIFFICULT IF NOT DANGEROUS BUT I COULDN T GET THIS CAR WITH CLEAR WINDOWS
OVERALL VISIBILITY IS FAIR I BELIEVE IT COULD BE IMPROVED
BLIND SPOTS ARE TERRIBLE
I VE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE IF I EVER HAVE A COLLISION
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS I AM OFTEN SURPRISED THERE IS A CAR RIGHT NEXT TO ME WHEN I AM PLANNING ON CHANGING LANES I ALWAYS LOOK BACK AND AROUND USING MY OUTSIDE MIRRORS BUT OFTEN SURPRISED BY A CAR RIGHT BESIDE ME THE STEERING WHEEL AND HARD CO
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE FOG LIGHTS AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT
HARD TO SEE WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE WHEN OTHER CARS ARE PARKED ON EITHER SIDE
NO ONE EVER FIXED THE SUV BLIND SPOT TO IN THE LEFT FRONT VIEW OF THE DRIVERS VIEW
BLINDSPOT MORE PRONOUNCED WITH THE SMALLER WINDOWS IN THE REAR
THE FRONT THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHERE THE SUPPORT FOR THE ROOF ON THE LEFT ON DRIVERS SIDE ALMOST HIT PEDS DUE TO BLIND SPOT WHEN IN PARKING LOT
THERE ARE MANY BLIND SPOTS USING THE SIDE MIRRORS ON BOTH THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDES FROM THE PASSENGER MIRROR IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL IF THE CAR IS IN YOUR LANE OR THE NEXT TO THE RIGHT
I FEEL THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT BETWEEN THE DRIVERS SIDE RIGHT HAND WINDOW AND THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WHERE THE TWO WINDOWS PAIR UP I HAVE ALMOST HIT THREE PEOPLE CROSSING THE STREET BECAUSE OF THIS IT HAS TAKEN ME SOME TIME TO GET USED TO HAVIN
DRIVERS BLIND SPOT I AM JUST NOT USED TO YET
I BELIEVE IF THE VEHICLES OUTSIDE MIRRORS WERE MOUNTED OUT ON THE FRONT FENDERS APPROXIMATELY IN LINE WITH THE FRONT OF THE FRONT WHEELS FROM THIS ANGLE THE BLIND SPOT IS NEARLY ELIMINATED 100% NEEDS BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM BACK UP CAMERA IS AL
THE WINDSHIELD IS LARGE ENOUGH AND SHAPED WELL THIS ALLOWS ME TO ALLOW LANE CHANGES WITH EASE AND SAFETY
LOVE THE MIRROR WARNING LIGHTS FOR SIDE TRAFFIC
REAR CAMERA LENS SEEMS TO GET DIRTY FOULED VERY EASILY AND OFTEN REQUIRED CLEANING
HARD TO SEE WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACE
IT HAS A FEW BLIND SPOTS
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS LEAVE A STREAK AND SOME KIND OF FILM ON THE TOP PASSENGER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD IT S ALL ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD WHEN DRIVING IN HEAVILY SALTED ROADS SO I THINK IT S JUST FROM THAT BUT IT STILL APPEARS AT THE TOP PASSENGER S
REAR BLIND SPOTS AND REAR WINDOW TOO SMALL
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT WHEN CHANGING LANES OR SOMETIMES TURNING
NO EXTRA SAFETY FEATURES WERE CHOSEN
THERE ARE TOO MANY CONTROLS ON THE WHEEL I HAVE TROUBLE FINDING THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS AND TRYING TO CLEAN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WITH WIPERS I DON T LIKE THAT THE LIGHT SETTING IS RIGHT THERE TOO IT SHOULD BE ON THE CONSOLE WHERE IT CANNOT
WHEN BACKING UP IT IS HARD TO LOOK OUT THE BACK BECAUSE OF THE GAP BETWEEN WINDOWS OF THE REAR WINDOW AND THE SIDE WINDOWS THE HEAD LIGHTS WORK VERY WELL AND THE FOG LIGHTS WORK EXCELLENT IN THE FOG
REARVIEWMIRROR BLOCKS VISIBILITY TOP OF PASSENGER WINDSHIELD
I LOVE THE SAFETY OF MY K900
REAR WINDOW VIEW AREA TO SMALL I HAD TO REMOVE MY REAR SEATS HEAD REST TO GAIN MORE VISIBLE AREA
AIRBAGS AND UVO EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE SERVICE SAVED ME FROM INJURY IN ACCIDENT
I AM AWARE THAT THE VISIBILITY ON THE RIGHT REAR VIEW MIRROR AS WELL AS CENTER REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN WISHING TO MOVE OVER FROM A LEFT LANE TO RIGHT LANE MIGHT BE BETTER I FIND THAT I NEED TO REALLY BE AWARE OF THE CLOSENESS OF A CAR WHICH SOMET
REAR CAMERA SENSORS CAN GET COVERED EASILY AND SEND OFF ALERTS FOR OBJECTS THAT AREN T THERE
AGAIN I AM CONCERN ABOUT THE BLIND SPOTS WITH THE WINDSHIELD POSTS AT 45 DEGREE ANGLES ALSO THE DANGER OF PROCEEDING AFTER STOP SIGNS WHEN THE CAR STALLS MONENTARILY UPO STARTING FORWARD THEN CATCHS AND LURCHES INTO THE INTERSECTION WHERE THERE A
I LIKE TO USE MY REAR VIEW MIRROR A LOT AND THE BACK WINDOW COULD BE LARGER SO VISIBILITY WOULD BE EASIER AND ALSO WOULD HELP WHEN LOOKING TO SEE IF THERE IS ANYTHING BEHIND YOU BEFORE BACKING UP EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A BACKUP CAMERA
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE HAD THE ADVANCED CRUISE CONTROL
MY MODEL DOES NOT HAVE BLIND SPOT SIDE MIRRORS THAT SHOULD BE A FEATURE ON ALL VEHICLES ALSO HEADLIGHTS SHOULD SHUT OFF AUTOMATICALLY WHEN VEHICLE IS TURNED OFF MY LIGHTS I DID NOT REALIZE THIS UNTIL MY NEIGHBOR TOLD ME MY LIGHTS WERE ON
THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR HAS A LARGE BLIND SPOT IT IS EASY TO LOSE PARTICULARLY A SMALL CAR THAT IS BESIDE YOU
WISH IT HAD BLIND SPOT SAFETY WARNING WITHOUT AN EXTRA PACKAGE
THERE IS SOME BLIND SPOTS KIND OF WISH THAT I HAD GONE WITH THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA
TRADED IN MY ALMOST NEW LEXUS BECAUSE OF POOR VISIBILITY HARD TO TELL HOW CLOSE FRONT FENDER OR REAR BUMPER WAS CLOSE TO SOMETHING HARD TO TELL IF LANE WAS CLEAR TO CHANGE LANES
WHEN THE CAR IS SHUT OFF IF THE HEAD LIGHTS ARE LEFT ON THERE IS NO WARNING SYSTEM TO ALERT THE DRIVER THAT THE HEAD LIGHTS NEED TO BE TURNED OFF
REAR BLIND SPOTS ARE PRETTY BAD
SMALLER BLIND SPOTS
THE DRIVING SAFETY IS GOOD BUT THE SIGHT LINES ESPECIALLY ON THE RIGHT FRONT AS WELL AS THE REAR WINDOW SIGHT LINES ARE POOR
VISIBILITY NOT THE BEST
SHOULD COME EQUIPPED WITH AUTOMATIC WIPERS LIKE MY ES 350 HAD
THE BLIND SPOT AND BACKUP MONITORS ARE GREAT
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE REALLY BAD IN THIS CAR I COULDN T IMAGINE DRIVING IT WITHOUT THE ELECTRONIC ASSISTANCE
NOT GOOD VISION FOR BLIND SPOTS WINDOWS TOO SMALL
HARD TO SEE OUT THE SIDE WINDOWS BUT THE ELECTRONIC ALERT SYSTEM AND THE BACKUP CAMERA MAKE UP FOR IT
THE REAR WINDOW FEELS FAIRLY NARROW COMPARED TO THE RX AND VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD
LOVE THE SIDE MIRROR LIGHT TO NOTIFY YOU THAT A VEHICLE IS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT
IT IS TAD HARD TO SEE BEHIND & TO REAR SIDES WE REMOVED REAR HEADRESTS TO IMPROVE REAR VISIBILITY WHOLE DRIVING
I LIKE THE ASSISTS THE CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH FOR BLIND SPOT AND PARKING
THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL BLIND SPOT HOWEVER THE SIDE MIRRORS TELL YOU
THE WIPER BLADE ON THE DRIVER SIDE DOES NOT CLEAR SO WELL I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED HOW IT CLEANS IN WORKS I GIVE IT A RATING OF A 5
I AM GOING TO REMOVE THE REAR HEADRESTS TO GAIN BETTER REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY
BECAUSE OF THE VEHICLE S BLIND SPOTS THE BLIND SPOT WARNING IS CRITICAL AND APPRECIATED
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL VEHICLES BUT ONLY USED TO ASSIST NOT AS A CRUTCH
GOOD THING THE CAR HAS THE BACKUP CAMERA LANE ASSIST ETC OTHERWISE VISION OUT SIDES AND BACK WOULD BE HAZARDOUS
KIND OF HARD TO SEE THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR
I LIKE THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SYSTEM THE VISIBILITY IN THE SIDE MIRRORS AND THE BACK UP CAMERA WITH A WARNING SYSTEM
REAR VIEW VISIBILITY IS HINDERED BY REAR SEAT HEADRESTS MIDDLE REAR SEATBELT AND SMALL BACK WINDOW
I HAVE BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING OUT OF DRIVEWAYS CAUSED BY PASSENGER HEADREST LOVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AND THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS ON MY SIDE MIRRORS
BLIND SPOT TOOL IS KEY FOR DECENT VISIBILITY IN THIS VEHICLE USING REAR VIEW MIRROR THE REAR WINDOW DOES NOT OFFER MUCH HEIGHT TO SEE CLEARLY BACKUP CAMERA ALSO HELPS ALLEVIATE THE ISSUE I DON T CONSIDER THIS AN ISSUE IN THE VEHICLE SINCE T
THE SUN VISORS ARE A MAJOR FRUSTRATION FOR ME THEY NEED TO BE DEEPER AND WIDER TO COVER AREA NEAR REAR VIEW MIRROW AND WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL VISOR TO SWING TO THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW LINCOLN USED TO PROVIDE THAT LINCOLN ALSO USED TO HAVE A
VISIBILITY BAD WITHOUT THE BLIS
I LOVE THE HEADLIGHTS THE WAY THEY MOVE WITH THE VEHICLE I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE RAIN SENSOR WIPERS
NEEDS FRONT PROXIMITY SENSORS THEN YOU CAN LET THE STYLING GO WILD
LOVE THE MIRRORS LIGHTING UP WHEN OBJECT IS IN BLIND SPOT
OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR ON THE DRIVER SIDE OBSTRUCTS THE CURVE VIEW
READ VISIBILITY IN BLIND SPOT AREAS IS VERY LIMITED I DON T LIKE HAVING TO PUT SO MUCH FAITH IN THE TECHNOLOGY FEATURES TO ASSIST WITH THE LACK OF VISIBILITY
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS BUT THAT IS A FACTOR OF BEING LOW WHEN AROUND TRUCKS & SUV SIZE VEHICLES THE BACK UP CAMERA IS WONDERFUL
BLIND SPOTS ARE VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED
THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS BLOCK THE VIEW THE SEAT BELT PANELS BLOCK THE VIEW I USE THE REAR CAMERA AND MIRRORS MORE THAN ACTUALLY LOOKING OUT THE REAR WINDOW
BLIND SPOT LIGHT IN EXTERIOR MIRROR AND THE TURN SIGNAL IN THE EXTERIOR MIRROR ARE THE SAME COLOR I OFTEN CONFUSE ONE FOR THE OTHER
THE NUMBER OF SAFETY FEATURES IS AMAZING EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND THERE IS ANOTHER FEATURE I DIDN T REALIZE
AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE GREAT
OEM WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE POOR QUALITY I DON T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I OWN A F 150 AND IT S OEM WIPERS ARE GREAT
SEEING OUT OF THE SIDE OR BACK OF THE VEHICLE FROM DRIVER SEAT IS WEAK FORWARD VIEWS AND LANE CHANGING TECHNOLOGY IS GOOD AND HELPS MAKE UP FOR THE TERRIBLE VISIBILITY
FEEL LIKE I HAVE GREAT VISIBILITY ALL ROUND MY CAR
REAR CAMERA IS EXCELLENT
I TRULY DEPEND ON THE REAR CAMERA FOR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING SHOULD BE AND INDUSTRY STANDARD
I DON T LIKE THAT LEXUS LIMITS THE FEATURES YOU CAN GET BASED ON PACKAGES FOR EXAMPLE F SPORT VEHICLES CANNOT GET LAND DEPARTURE WARNING THAT DOESN T SEEM SMART TO ME EITHER MAKE IT STANDARD OR LET THE BUYER CHOOSE BUT DON T TAKE IT AWAY
THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS A REAL LIFE SAVER
I COULDN T ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE FOR SAFETY IN A CAR
THE WAY THE REAR SEAT WINDOWS ARE DESIGNED ARE OUTSTANDING THERE ARE ZERO BLIND SPOTS THANK YOU
WHILE I LIKE THE LIGHT THAT COMES ON IN THE BLIND SPOT IN THE SIDE MIRRORS I STILL LIKED THE SMALL MIRRORS THAT WERE LOCATED ON THE SIDE MIRRORS IN PREVIOUS MODELS
HAVING THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR IS A REALLY HELPFUL SAFETY DEVICE
HEADREST TOO BIG OBSTRUCTING REAR VISION
WITH REAR CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT WARNING IT ADDS A LOT OF SAFETY
THE BLIND SPOT IS BIGGER THAN I D LIKE
WISH THE LANE CHANGE LIGHT IN MIRROR WAS MORE NOTICEABLE WISH IT HAD FRONTAL CRASH WARNING IN OTHER WORDS WHEN YOU GET TO CLOSE TO CAR IN FRONT OF YOU
I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE I WAS ABLE TO TEST OUT ITS SAFETY THIS WINTER
I LIKE THE LITTLE YELLOW WARNING LIGHT WHEN ANOTHER VEHICLE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT
THE SENSE OF BLIND SPOTS IS MORE EVIDENT THAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED THE REAR WINDOW COULD BE BIGGER TO SEE OUTSIDE BETTER
WOULD LIKE BRIGHTER HEADLIGHTS
I WISH THERE WERE A WAY TO TURN ON THE REAR CAMERA WITHOUT PUTTING THE CAR IN REVERSE THE REAR CAMERA PROVIDES A MUCH BETTER VIEW THAN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
I SIT UP HIGH ENOUGH TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON ALL AROUND ME I WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT THE BLIND SPOT INFORMATION SYSTEM VISIBILITY IS GREAT
THE BLIND SPOT LANE CHANGING VISIBILITY IS AWESOME
IT DOES TAKE A MINUTE OR TWO FOR THE WINDOWS TO CLEAR ONCE THE ENGINE IS TURNED OFF AND ON DURING RAINY WEATHER YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO TOUCH THE TEMP GAGE OR DEFROST SWITCH TO SEE AGAIN SOME VEHICLES WINDOWS REMAIN VISIBLY CLEAR REGARDLESS
AS DRIVER HAVE TROUBLE LOOKING OVER LEFT SHOULDER AND HAVING GOOD VISABILITY
IT S GREAT TO HAVE THE INDICATOR ON THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS WHEN THERE S A VEHICLE IN THE BLIND SPOT
WHEN DRIVING IT APPEARS THAT THE DESIGNERS THOUGHT EVERYONE WOULD OPT FOR THE LANE CHANGING TECHNOLOGY ITS HARD TO SEE VEHICLES IN YOUR BLIND SPOTS WHICH ON THIS VEHICLE ARE QUITE LARGE OK THE BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGER THAN THE OLD 626 THAT WE U
REALLY APPRECIATE THE SAFETY WARNINGS IN BOTH SIDE MIRRORS BACKING WARNINGS
REAR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING UP IS HOPELESS WITHOUT THE REAR VIEW CAMERA I AM HOPING IT NEVER STOPS WORKING OR THE CAR WILL BE USELESS ALSO A SURPRISING BLIND SPOT EXISTS TOWARDS THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR PILLAR A WOMAN ON A BICYCLE WAS ENT
WORK ON REDUCING THE BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY IS GENERALLY GOOD FROM ALL ANGLES AND CANNOT RECALL AN INSTANCE WHERE I HAD TROUBLING SEEING THAT WAS DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE CAR
I FEEL VERY SAFE WITH THE BLIND SIDE ASSIST AND REAR VIEW CAMERA VISIBILITY IS ALSO GOOD
REAR PATCH PANEL AREA A LITTLE HIGH WHICH PREVENTS DEPTH PERCEPTION YET BACK UP CAMERA IS EXCELLENT TOOL TO OVERCOME ISSUE
B PILLAR WIDTH LOCATION MAKES VISIBILITY AWKWARD FOR TALLER DRIVERS
BACK UP CAMERA IS A NECESSITY READ VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT
BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES ON PASSENGER SIDE
SUN VISORS ARE USLESS FOR US SHORTER FOLK BIG BLIND SPOT WHEN TRYING TO MERGE RIGHT INTO TRAFFIC
I LOVE THE BACK UP SENSOR THEIR WAS A CHILD BETWEEN THE CAR NEXT TO ME I DIDN T SEE HIM BUT THE SENSOR DID AND GAVE ME A WARNING I STOP AND THE CHILD RAN RIGHT BEHIND ME THANK YOU FOR THIS FEATURE
FRONT AND ESPECIALLY REAR CORNERS HAVE LARGE BLIND SPOTS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO PULL INTO TRAFFIC AND BACK OUT OF PARKING SPACES
WOULD PREFER TO BE ABLE TO TURN OFF OR ADJUST AUTO DIMMING REAR VIEW MIRROR
NEEDS FULL LED LIGHTS
THE MORE I DRIVE THE CAR THE MORE I LIKE IT VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT AND I LIKE THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL AND LANE KEEPING SYSTEM ON A HIGHWAY
THANK GOD FOR THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT REAR PASSENGER SIDE VISIBILITY THANK YOU FOR THE WARNING LIGHTS WHEN A CAR IS IN THE NEXT LANE
TO MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN USING MIRRORS
REAR WINDOW SEEMS VERY SMALL COMPARED TO OUR OLDER VEHICLES BUT DO REALIZE THAT THE VEHICLE HAS THE REAR VIEW CAMERA TO ASSIST WITH BACKING UP
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM AND THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA
THE VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS FANTASTIC AND THE HEADLIGHT BEAMS ARE BEYOND AMAZING
NOT AS VISIBLE WITH GIANT HEADRESTS BACKUP CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING HELP TO FIX THIS FAILING
THE CARS SHOULD COME EQUIPPED WITH A BACK UP CAMERA REAR VISIBILITY WHILE BACKING UP IS POOR
SIDE AND REAR VISIBILITY COULD BE BETTER
BOTTOM OF REAR WINDOWS RISE UP MAKING THE VIEW SMALLER VISIBILITY TAKES GETTING USED TO PILLARS IN FRONT ARE LARGER THAN MY LAST CAR VISIBILITY TAKES GETTING USED TO
INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL XENON HEADLIGHTS @ NIGHT LANE WARNING SIGNALS ON THE MIRRORS THEY ALREADY SAVED ME FROM A FREEWAY COLLSION THE BRAKING SYSTEM FOR STOPPING THE CAR AT LESS THAN 19 MPH
REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT
IT S A SMALL CUV HOWEVER INSIDE IT FEELS BIG SO YOU FEEL SAFE THE SAFETY SYSTEMS WORK WELL BLIS ETC IT S VISIBILITY OUT OF THE MKC IS GOOD YOU SIT UP ENOUGH AND THE SEATS HAVE ENOUGH ADJUSTMENTS TO HELP SEE OUT WELL THE REAR CAMERA AN
THE TRUNK LINE SEEMS HIGH FROM INSIDE WHICH LIMITS VISIBILITY ON BACKING
GOOD FEELING OF SAFETY
WIDER REAR AND SIDE WINDOWS FOR MORE VISIBILITY
I M SATISFIED WITH VISIBILITY AND SAFETY FEATURES
I AM CONCERNED AS THERE ARE HORRIBLE BLIND SPOTS IN THE FRONT ESPECIALLY ON A CURVE THE WINDOW TRIM ON THE FRONT GLASS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS ON TURNS
REAR SEAT HEADRESTS AND THE SMALL REAR WINDSHIELD COMPROMISE VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER S SEAT
SMALL BUBBLE MIRRORS TO HELP SEE A MOTORCYCLE THAT MIGHT BE IN THE BLIND SPOT WOULD BE A GOOD THING
BLIND SPOTS ARE NOTABLE AND REARWARD VISION THRU MIRRORS NEEDS IMPROVEMENT THE ELECTRONICS HELP BUT PASSIVE SYSTEMS SUCH AS BETTER MIRRORS AND LARGER WINDOWS ARE PREFERRED
SIDE WINDOW LINE RISES SUBSTANTIALLY FROM FRONT TO REAR RESULTING IN POOR OVER THE SHOULDER VISIBILITY DURING A LANE CHANGE THIS IS A LARGE DEPARTURE FROM THE 1ST GENERATION CAR WHICH HAD EXCEPTIONAL REARWARD OVER THE SHOULDER VISIBILITY THE L
I LOVE THE HEADLIGHTS THEY ARE BRIGHT AND TURN AS THE CAR TURNS VISIBILITY IS GREAT
DRIVER OPERATED RETRACTABLE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS WOULD HELP WHEN GOING THROUGH CAR WASH FACILITATES AND PARKING THEY ARE BIG MIRRORS BIG IS GREAT THEY PROVIDE EXCELLENT VISIBILITY BUT I NEED A METHOD TO PULL THEM IN IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS INST
ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IS WITH BLIND SPOTS LOOKING TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT AT INTERSECTIONS WHEN TURNING ESPECIALLY TURNING TO THE LEFT
I FIND THAT THE BLIND SPOTS ARE MORE SO IN THIS VEHICLE I M NOT PARTICULARLY THRILLED ABOUT THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW WHEN BACKING UP
THE CAR IS A FAR BETTER CAR THEN MY LAST ONE SATURN ION IT HANDLES BETTER BETTER VISIBILITY BETTER ALL AROUND
EASIEST CAR I HAVE EVER PARALLEL PARKED DUE TO VISIBILITY
WHEN THE TOP IS UP IT IS HARD TO CHANGE LANES DUE TO THE LARGE BLIND SPOTS CREATED BY THE SMALL REAR WINDOW
THERE ARE SO MANY SAFETY SYSTEMS THAT HAS BUILT INTO MY CAR I GRAND TOURING THAT I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE MY PURCHASE I AM VERY PLEASED FOR THIS HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT MAZDA WOULD OFFER AN OPTION AT LEAST FOR THE I GRAND TOURING T
DON T LIKE THE REAR VIEW VISIBILITY BECAUSE OF HIGH PLACEMENT OF THE SIGNAL LIGHT AND NO REAR WINDOW WIPER
LARGER DRIVER SIDE OUTSIDE MIRROR IMPEDES VISIBILITY WHEN PARKING IN A FORWARD PULL IN SPOT
I WISH IT HAD A REAR VIEW CAMERA OR BEEPING MECHANISM BECAUES IT WOULD HELP WITH PARKING AND BETTER VIEWING
IT S UNFORTUNATE THAT THE REAR PASSENGER HEADRESTS OBSTRUCT THE VIEW OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW THE SIZE MIRROR INSERTS HELP WITH THIS BUT IT S STILL AN ANNOYANCE TO HAVE THEM BLOCKING YOUR REAR VIEW
I WASN T SURE THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE LIKE THE NOTIFICATIONS BUT I LOVE THEM
OVERALL THE CAR HAS A GREAT FEEL WHEN DRIVING BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE REAR PASSENGER AND BACK WINDOWS ARE SOMEWHAT ON THE SMALL SIDE IT HINDERS REAR VIEW VISIBILITY AND MAKES LANE DEPARTURE SLIGHTLY MORE DANGEROUS BUT IT IS STILL ACCEPTABLE
THERE IS LIMITED VISIBILITY SO I AM HAPPY THERE IS A REAR CAMERA AND LANE CHANGE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
AWD AND BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS GREAT
EXCELLENT FORWARD VISIBILITY
POOR VISIBILITY TO THE RIGHT SIDE FROM THE DRIVING POSITION DUE TO HEAD REST ON PASSENGER SEAT AND SIDE COLUMN BETWEEN FRONT AND REAR WINDOW
VERY SMALL CAR SO ABILITY TO ENGINEER IN MAXIMUM SAFETY FEATURES IS LIMITED
DRIVER SIDE BLIND SPOT HAS STILL NOT BEEN IMPROVED
NEED BACKUP CAMERA
BLIND SPOT MONITORING REALLY HELPS WITH BLIND SPOTS
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT
SNOW PILES UP ON DRIVERS SIDE OF WINDSHIELD REDUCING VISIBILITY
REALLY LIKE THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE HEADLIGHTS AND AUTO DIMMING FEATURE OF THE BRIGHTS
IT NEEDS AUTO DIMMING HEADLIGHTS I DON T TRUST THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM
BLIND SPOT MONITORS ARE VERY HELPFUL AND WORK WELL
DIFFICULT SEEING OTHER CARS WHEN CHANGING LANES DUE TO SMALLER REAR SIDE WINDOWS THE BSM IS A BIG HELP BUT I D RATHER BE ABLE TO SEE WELL TOO
GREAT BLIND SPOT ALERT SYSTEM LOVE IT
GLAD I HAVE BLIND SPOT MONITORING BECAUSE REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT DUE TO SLOPING ROOF LINE
I LIKE THE NEW BLIND SPOT MONITOR VERY EFFECTIVE
LIMITED VISIBILITY THRU REAR WINDOW
BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS THE BEST DEVICE IN THE CAR
I LOVE THE 10 AIR BAGS AND THE OVERALL FEELING OF GREAT SAFETY THE OVERALL OUTSIDE VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN AVERAGE AND I FEEL THAT IT COULD BE IMPROVE
REAR VIEW COULD BE BIGGER
AUTOMATIC BRAKING NOT CRUISE CONTROL WOULD BE A GOOD OPTION TO OFFER
THERE ARE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT BUT THIS HAS BEEN EASED BY THE NEW BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IN THE MIRRORS VERY NICE SAFETY ENHANCEMENT
SITTING UP GIVES MORE VISIBILITY AND FEELING OF SAFETY FOR HAZARDS ALL AROUND
THE MAJOR ISSUE WITH MY NX 200T IS THE HEADRESTS THEY ARE TOO LARGE AND TALL VERY VIEW OBSTRUCTING I TOOK ALL OF THE OUT SO I COULD VISIBLY SEE TO DRIVE BIG ISSUE WITH ME I PAID MONEY FOR THESE AND I WONDER IF THEY CAN BE REPLACED WITH
AT TIMES REAR VIEW MIRROR ON PASSENGER SIDE SEEMS TO GET IN THE WAY OF MY VIEW
I RATED THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT AS TRULY EXCEPTIONAL BUT THAT IS BECAUSE I USUALLY HAVE THE REAR SEATS DOWN WHEN THE REAR SEATS ARE UP VISIBLITY IS DRASTICALLY REDUCED ESPECIALLY IF THE HEADRESTS ARE RAISED
OFTEN THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT REACH FAR ENOUGH INTO THE CORNERS OF THE WINDSHIELD I WILL ADDRESS THIS WHEN I RETURN FOR MY FIRST SERVICE
THE NX FEELS LIKE A WELL CRAFTED VEHICLE WITH NUMEROUS SAFETY FEATURES THAT FEELS SOLID WHEN DRIVING
SEEMS TO BE VERY SAFE VERY FEW BLIND SPOTS WITH BSM IT HELPS A LOT TOO LED HEADLIGHTS ARE GREAT TOO
THE LANE CHANGE BLIND SPOT IS A BIT LARGE BUT THE BLIND SPOT INDICATER HELPS WITH THAT
REAR VISIBILITY IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED
POOR REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT DUE TO REAR SEAT HEADREST OBSTRUCTION
VISIBILITY FROM THE BACK WINDOW IS NOT SO GOOD BUT THE BACK UP CAMERA IS GREAT THE BLIND SPOT AND REAR CROSS TRAFFIC FEATURES ARE AMAZING AND SHOULD BE STANDARD SAFETY FEATURES INDUSTRY WIDE
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS
MOTORCYCLES ARE NOT PICKED UP BY THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS WHEN PREPARING TO CHANGE LANES
SMALL REAR VIEW WINDOW REAR WIPER CLEANS VERY SMALL PART OF REAR VIEW WINDOW
THE AIM OF THE WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID SHOULD BE HIGHER IN THE MOUNTAINS IT TAKES A LONG PUMP TO GET ENOUGH LIQUID TO CLEAR THE WINDSHIELD IN TRAFFIC IT S FINE ON A CLEAR ROAD BUT WHEN LARGE TRUCKS ARE THROWING SNOW THE VOLUME IS ALMOST A H
THE FRONT HEADRESTS ARE SO LARGE IT FORMS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT EASY TO ADAPT TO IT HOWEVER
LOTS OF BLIND SPOTS BUT THE BSW ALERT IS A MUST HAVE LOVE IT
POOR REAR VISIBILITY PARK ASSIST NOT AVAILABLE WITH THIS CAR VIDEO FREQUENTLY LOOKS FUZZY
I AM AMAZED AT HOW USEFUL THE BACKUP CAMERA AND WARNING SYSTEM IS THAT ALERTS FOR VEHICLES PEOPLE COMING DOWN THE PARKING AISLE IS ON THE CAR
IF NOT FOR THE DRIVING ASSIST IT WOULD BE HARD TO SAFELY CHANGE LANES SOME FOR BACKING UP IF NOT FOR THE REAR CAMERA
REAR WINDOW IS RELATIVELY SMALL AND BACK SEAT HEADRESTS ARE LARGE SO VISIBILITY IS A BIT COMPROMISED
THE BACKSEAT HEAD RESTS CUT DOWN VISIBILITY CONSIDERABLY WOULDN T IT BE GREAT IF THEY RETRACTED BY A DRIVER S PUSHBUTTON CONTROL INTO THE INSIDE OF THE BACK OF THE SEAT
GREAT VISIBILITY FROM ALL AREAS
THE DRIVER S SEAT NEEDS TO BE HIGHER I WOULD HELP IF I CAN SEE THE FRONT OF THE CAR THE VISIBILITY IS SOMEWHAT HARD BUT THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS REALLY HELPS AS WELL AS THE CAMERA MONITOR IT WOULD HELP IF THE BACK CAMERA PROVIDES A MORE ACCURATE
NO REAR WINDOW WASHER IS DRAWBACK EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A REAR WIPER BLADE
TROUBLE WITH BLIND SPOT
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE WARNING SYSTEM
THE SILVER TRIM AROUND THE VENT NEXT TO THE STEERING WHEEL REFLECTS IN THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW ALSO IT SHOULD BE AN OPTION WHETHER YOU WANT THE DIMMED REAR VIEW MIRROR AT NIGHT
ALL OF THE VISIBILITY FEATURES MAKE ME FEEL SECURE
LANE KEEPING CAN BE TOO SENSITIVE ENGAGES WHEN VEHICLE IS NOT REALLY OUT OF LANE COLLISION WARNING SOMETIMES ENGAGES WHEN NO OTHER CARS ARE CLOSE
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT BACK CORNERS OF THE CAR WHEN CHANGING LANES DUE TO BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOT DETECTION ISN T AS GOOD AS I WOULD LIKE
REAR VISIBILITY COULD BE IMPROVED UPON WHEN BACKING UP THIS IS OFFSET BY THE USE OF THE ELECTRONIC DETECTION SYSTEM
SHOULD HAVE FOG LIGHTS IF IT DOES I WOULDNT KNOW WHERE CONTROLS WERE
I FEEL THAT THE REAR WINDOW COULD BE A BIT LARGER IT DOES CREATE MANY BLIND SPOTS
I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THIS CAR IT FEELS SOLID AND ALL THE DRIVING SAFETY FEATURES HAS MADE ME A BETTER DRIVER
AVERAGE RE BLIND SPOT ON SIDE THERE IS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT CREATED BY COMBINATION OF SIDE MIRROR AND VERTICAL SUPPORT BETWEEN FRONT AND SIDE WINDOWS OFTEN DANGEROUS FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC FROM THE SIDE
REAR VISIBILITY NOT THE BEST
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HAD THE OPTION FOR A LANE WARNING SYSTEM NOT OFFERED IN REAR CAMERA SHOULD ACTIVATE WHEN CHANGING LANES LIKE IT DOES WITH THE NEW HONDA ACCORD
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE A MYSTERY TO ME I HAVE RAIN SENSING WIPERS AND HAVE NO CLUE HOW TO OPERATE THEM PROPERLY THE MANUAL ON THEIR OPERATION IS WRITTEN IN GREEK I ABSOLUTELY HATE THESE CONTROLS
LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY SIDE MIRROR ADJUSTMENT NEEDS MORE RANGE
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE THE BLIND SPOTS BUT THIS IS MADE UP FOR BY THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION
THE LARGE LEFT REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS VIEW OF CLOSE LEFT FRONT VIEW
LIKE HE AUTOMATIC WIPERS
I FEEL IT THE CAR IS WELL BUILT BUT I HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY IN A COLLISION WITH A LARGER VEHICLE PERHAPS THIS IS JUST AN ISSUE WITH SEDANS IN THIS SIZE RANGE
DIFFICULT TO SEE BLIND SPOT WIPERS ARE AUTOMATIC WHICH IS FANTASTIC ALTHOUGH WHEN THE RAIN DECREASES TO SPRINKLES IT EITHER KEEPS GOING AND CONSEQUENTLY DRY RUBS WINDOW OR STOPS AND I MANUALLY ADJUST IT
IT S BETTER THAN I EXPECTED FOR VISIBILITY AND THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR IS NICE
AWFUL FACTORY WIPER BLADES FOR THE QUALITY OF CAR HAD TO REPLACE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE BLIND SPOT LIGHTS ON THE OUTSIDE MIRROR WONDERFUL
BLIND SPOTS SEEM A BIT BIGGER ON SIDES
HEADLIGHTS GIVE VERY GOOD NIGHT VISIBILITY BY FAR THE BEST I VE EVER HAD IN A CAR HOWEVER GOING INTO A TUNNEL AND THE LIGHTS ARE ON AUTO THEY ARE TOO SLOW TO TURN ON AND GIVE ADEQUATE LIGHT EVEN TURNING THEM TO ON THEY ARE STILL A BIT SLOW TO
REAR VIEW VISIBILITY LESS THAN AVERAGE
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS DO NOT SHOW ENOUGH VISIBILITY RIGHT SIDE IS POOR SHOULD MAME MIRRORS BIGGER
DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF REAR WINDOW ON PASSENGER SIDE WHEN MERGING OR EXITING PARKING SPACE
DUE TO ITS SHORT STATURE THE PASSENGER HEAD RESTS GET IN THE WAY OF LOOKING OVER YOUR RIGHT SHOULDER TO SEE IF A CAR IS IN YOUR BLIND SPOT
THE DRIVER ASSIY PACKAGE IS GREAT AND USE THE SIDE WARNING LIGHTS WHEN CHANGING LANES ALL THE TIME THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ALSO AWESOME AND REALLY MAKE IT EASY TO SEE IN THE DARK I FEEL VERY SAFE IN THIS CAR
FORWARD COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM IS A LITTLE TOUCHY AND SOMETIMES ACTIVATES WHEN THERE IS NO CAR IN FRONT OF ME OR DOES NOT ACTIVATE WHEN THEIR IS A CAR IN FRONT OF ME
I ESPECIALLY LOVE DRIVING THIS CAR AT NIGHT ESPECIALLY ON DARK ROADS THE VISIBILITY IS EXCEPTIONAL
I TRADED IN A BMW 3 SERIES AND THE REAR WINDOW HAD MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY OTHER THAN THAT I ENJOY THE A3
REAR HEADRESTS BLOCK MUCH OF VIEW EUROPEAN MODELS HAVE HEADRESTS WHICH CAN BE LOWERED BUT NOT IN THE US THANKFULLY THERE IS A REAR CAMERA AND SONAR TO MAKE UP FOR THIS
THE POSITION OF THE DOOR POST OFTEN OBSTRUCTS VISIBILITY OUT THE DRIVER S SIDE AS WELL AS THE PASSENGER SIDE
I LOVE THE BLIND SPOT ALERTING
PASSENGER SIDE REAR SEAT HEAD REST CAN REDUCE DRIVER VISIBILITY IN THE BACK LOOKING VIA REAR MIRROR TOWARDS BACK RIGHT SIDE OF THE CAR
BACKUP CAMERA WARNING SYSTEM VERY HELPFUL WHEN PULLING OUT OF HEAD IN PARKING SPACES NICE TOUCH
SECURE SAFETY BETTER THAN ANY OTHER VEHICLE OWNWED OR DRIVEN INCLUDING AUDI JEEP AND CHRYSLER
THE CAR FEELS VERY SOLID AND STABLE HOWEVER COMPARED TO OTHER CARS I HAVE DRIVEN REAR LEFT AND RIGHT QUADRANT VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS RESTRICTED DUE TO THE C PILLAR
THE TECH PACKAGE HELPS THE VISIBILITY BECAUSE OF THE LIGHT THAT GOES ON WHEN THERE IS SOMEONE IN MY BLIND SPOT� LOVE THE CAR
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT OF GOOD QUALITY
BOTH VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY ARE GOOD BUT I AM MORE IMPRESSED BY THE DRIVING SAFETY THAT IS EXCEPTIONAL THAN THE VISIBILITY THAT IS AS EXPECTED
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THE A PILLAR AND SIDE MIRRORS GET IN THE WAY OF GOOD VISIBILITY AT INTERSECTIONS
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT IN BACK WITH TOP UP
DO NOT LIKE PROXIMITY OF A PILLAR AND OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS MIRRORS ARE BIG
I LIKED THE EXTRA SUN VISOR ABOVE THE CENTER REAR VIEW MIRROR ON MY 2001 AUDI ALLROAD VERY USEFUL WITH DRIVING INTO THE SUNRISE OR SUNSET
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FOR VEHICLES MERGING FROM THE RIGHT REAR
THE LANE DEPARTURE AND BLIND SPOT SYSTEM IS AWESOME
WISH THE CAR HAD FRONT BUMPER SENSORS IN ADDITION TO THE REAR LOVE THE SIDE ASSIST FOR CHANGING LANES WONDERFUL IDEA AND TECHNOLOGY ALSO WISHED THE HEADLIGHTS SWIVELED WHEN TURNING MY BMW HAD THIS FEATURE AND ALSO THE CORNERING LIGHTS THOSE A
SOMETIMES ITS HARD TO SEE THE BLINDSPOT WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD BACKWARDS
SOME LIMITATION OF REARWARD OBLIQUE VISIBILITY DUE TO DOORPOST
BEST ERGONOMICS
VERY WELL VISIBLE
BIT OF A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER RIGHT SHOULDER IN CONVERTIBLE
WOULD LIKE DIRECTIONAL HEADLIGHTS
VERY GOOD VISIBILITY WITH MINIMAL BLIND SPOTS WITH BEING A CONVERTIBLE
HEAD LIGHTS PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES LEAVE STREAKS AND THE MOISTURE SENSOR COULD BE IMPROVED IT TRIGGERS THE WIPERS WHEN THERE IS VERY LITTLE MOISTURE AND SOME TIMES DOES NOT TRIGGER THEM WHEN THERE IS A LOT OF MOISTURE
THERE IS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT REAR PASSENGER SIDE DUE TO THE WAY THE CAR IS DESIGNED IF I AM PULLING ACROSS A FOUR LANE TWO WAY HIGHWAY AND WANT TO TURN LEFT ONCE I PULL INTO THE CENTER AREA IT S NOT EASY TO SEE THE ON COMING TRAF
EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY IN SIDE MIRRORS IS OUTSTANDING
THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE SIZE OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS I FEEL LIKE IT GIVES ME A BIGGER BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY AT A CROSSWALK BUT I FOUND THE SAME THING WHEN DRIVING A PRERUNNER
REAR HEADRESTS BLOCK THE REAR VISIBILITY BUT I DON T THINK THERE IS MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT
I WOULD LIKE THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS TO GO FASTER
LOVE THE LANE ASSIST AND SIDE LANE WARNING LIGHTS
REAR SEAT HEADRESTS INTERFERE WITH REAR VISIBILITY
REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS A BIG PLUS
I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE THE INDICATORS ON THE REARVIEW MIRRORS THAT WARN OF VEHICLES IN YOUR BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
THEY NEED TO ACTIVATE VOICE CONTROL ON CONVERTIBLES IT IS NOT SAFE LOOKING DOWN TO USE THE KNOB TO TYPE IN INFO FOR THE SYSTEM YOU ARE TRYING TO USE LEXUS CONVERTIBLES YOU CAN USE VOICE COMMANDS AND IT WORKS FINE
SIDE VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT IS NOT THE BEST ESPECIALLY IF THE ROAD ENDS AT A SLANT AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK TO YOUR LEFT TO SEE IF IT IS SAFE TO PROCEED
I LOVE THE PRE COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM
OVERALL VISIBILITY OUT OF CAR
WOULD BE NICE TO GET WASHER FLUID TO SQUIRT OUT FOR FRONT AND BACK BEFORE THE WIPERS HAVE STARTED WIPING CURRENTLY THERE IS A DELAY THAT IS NO BIG DEAL BUT NOT FAVORABLE EFFECTIVENESS OF REAR WIPER OK WISH WIPER WAS A LITTLE BIGGER ESPECIALLY I
AGAIN THE REAR HEADRESTS ALMOST ENTIRELY OBSTRUCT THE BLIND SIDES FROM THE REAR OF THE CAR IF NOT FOR THE WARNING LIGHTS ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS I WOULD NEVER HAVE CHOSEN THIS CAR APPARENTLY THIS IS A DESIGN OF CHOICE FOR AUDI BUT IT IS IT
WHILE I LIKE THE LARGE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THEY DO CREATE A BLIND SPOT WHEN TURNING LEFT WONDERING IF THE VISORS COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER AS THEY SOMETIMES AREN T LOW ENOUGH TO BLOCK SUN GLARE
BLIND SPOT FROM THE SIDE MIRROR WHEN TAKING A LEFT TURN
INCLUDE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL IN TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE DITTO FOR HEADLIGHTS THAT FOLLOW TURNS
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SUN VISOR THAT EXTENDS
I WOULD LIKE AN AUDIBLE WARNING AS WELL AS A FLASHING LIGHT WARNING IN THE BLIND SPOT SYSTEM
ITS AN SUV SO THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME LIMITED VISIBILITY
GOOD OVERALL VISIBILITY AND SAFETY OF THE VEHICLE QUALITY CONTROL IN DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING COULD BE IMPROVED
THE ONE THING THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE WONDERFUL WAS THE AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS IT GETS SO ANNOYING SOMETIMES NOT SURE IF THERE IS A WAY TO SHUT IT OFF I LIVE IN CT AND WITH THE SNOW MELTING AND WATER ON THE ROADS I GO THROUGH SO MUCH WI
ALREADY MENTIONED PASSENGER SIDE FRONT WHEEL BLIND SPOT
SOMETIMES THE REAR VIEW MIRROR GET IN MY WAY WHEN I AM LOOKING TO THE RIGHT
POOR SIDE VISIBILITY
THE REASON THE VISIBILITY IS IS NOT A PROBLEM IS THE EXCEPTIONAL FEATURES ON THE CAR LIKE THE CHANGE LANE SIGNAL AND THE REAR CAMERA AND BEEPERS THAT HELPS THE DRIVER TO NAVIGATE TRAFFIC WITHOUT MANY IF ANY PROBLEMS THE AUDI Q3 IS A GREAT CAR
SURPRISINGLY GOOD VISIBILITY CONSIDERING THE FAST ROOFLINE AND SHORT SIDE WINDOWS AS A RESULT
BLIND SPOT WARNINGS SOMETIMES HAVE FALSE POSITIVES RESULTING IN BRIGHT WARNING FLASHES DURING OTHERWISE SAFE LANE CHANGES SOMETIMES DETECTS VEHICLES TWO LANES OVER RATHER THAN JUST IN THE NEXT LANE
I THINK SOMEONE SHOULD DESIGN A THING THAT WOULD HELP WITH PARKING FORWARD IN A TIGHT URBAN GARAGE ENTERING MY GARAGE DOOR IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE WHERE AS EXITING IT BACKING OUT IS MADE EASY WITH THE REAR CAMERA SOME SORT OF THING THAT WOULD
THERE IS NO BACK UP CAMERA WHICH SHOULD HAVE STANDARD LIKE ALL THE OTHER NEWER VEHICLES
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BLIND MIRROR LIGHT FLASH WHEN THERE IS A VEHICLE IN YOUR BLIND SIDE WHEN THIS LIGHT IS NOT FLASHING IT DOES NOT ALERT YOU QUICKLY
I LOVE BEING VISIBLE IN MY BEAMER I DEFINITELY THINK I LOOK GOOD IN IT
VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT LOOKING OUT OF THE OPPOSITE REAR WINDOW IS PARTIALLY BLOCKED BY THE PILLAR
VISORS NEED EXTENDERS TO WIDEN WHEN NEEDED
VERY GOOD LOVE THE BLIND SPOT FEATURE
IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT
HEADLIGHTS SEEM A LITTLE SHORT IN SHOWING VISIBLE DISTANCE AT NIGHT THE BRIGHTS ARE NICE IN WHAT YOU CAN SEE
REAR VISIBILITY IS A LITTLE LOW DUE TO SIZE OF REAR WINDOW
I LOVE THE LED HEADLIGHTS
THE SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE BETTER DESIGNED
I LOVE THE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHT ADJUSTMENT CONTROLS AND HOW WELL IT WORKS YOUR HIGH BEAMS AND LOW BEAMS
I LIKE THE REAR CAMERA ESPECIALLY THE LINES THAT GUIDE ME
THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT IS TOO SMALL
SINCE I HAVE TO MOVE THE SEAT SO FAR FORWARD VISIBILITY IS POOR
GLAD WE UPGRADED TO THE TECH PACKAGE FOR THE LIGHTING
HEADLIGHT ARE A BIT TOO DIM IN MY OPINION AND COULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED
REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY TOO SMALL
REAR VISIBILITY IS SO POOR THAT IT WOULD NOT BE SAFE TO DRIVE WITHOUT REAR SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AND BACK CAMERA
REAR END BLIND SPOT S VISIBILITY IS TRULY LACKING ESPECIALLY PASSENGER SIDE
VISIBILITY OUT OF REAR SIDE WINDOWS COULD BE IMPROVED
REARWARD VISIBILITY IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED WHEN COMPARED TO SOME VEHICLES IN THIS SEGMENT
REAR VIEW MIRROR DOESN T DIM ADEQUATELY TO REDUCE THE GLARE FROM LIGHTS BEHIND DRIVER S SIDE VIEW MIRROR DOESN T REDUCE GLARE AT ALL
IF YOU ARE SHORT AND CANNOT RAISE THE SEAT HIGH ENOUGH THE DRIVER S SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR OBSTRUCTS YOUR LEFT TURN MOVEMENT VISIBILITY I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT I AM THE ONLY ONE HAVING THAT PROBLEM SINCE THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OF THE DRIVERS SEAT DOE
IT WAS A POOR DECISION NOT TO INCLUDE FRONT PROXIMITY DETECTORS BEEPERS ON A $50K CAR REAR IS ALSO MISSING BUT HAS THE REAR VIDEO REAR VIDEO CAMERA IS CHEAP SAVING A COUPLE BUCKS WAS A POOR DECISION
THE CAR HAS MANY REAR BLIND SPOTS
FRONT COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM IS POOR BLINDSPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS EXCELLENT
JUST FEEL SAFE WHILE DRIVING THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR IS GREAT
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS ON BOTH SIDES MAY BLOCK VISION NEED TO TRY TO LOOK AROUND IT OR TURN HEAD TO BE SURE ALSO ON THE SUN VISORS I STILL OWN AN ACURA CL AND I LOVE THE ADDITIONAL VISOR THAT IT HAS IT REALLY
HAD HOPED THAT COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM AND ACURALINK WERE INSTALLED AND NOW SEE THAT THE WILL HAVE THESE ITEMS
THE VISIBILITY OF THIS CAR IS PROBABLY THE POOREST I VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN A VEHICLE THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS BLOCK QUITE A BIT OF THE REAR WINDOW THE FRONT WINDOW IS EITHER SMALL OR SLANTED SO THAT VISIBILITY IS HINDERED LOOKING TO SEE IF SOME
I FEEL THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN I LOOK OVER MY SHOULDER AND WHEN BACKING UP I AM STILL GETTING USED TO THE REAR CAMERA
AGAIN WISH THE CAR HAD SIDE FRONT REAR ELECTRONIC SENSOR MONITORING SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THAT WOULD CERTAINLY ADD COST TO THIS VEHICLE THE THREE VIEWING POSITION REAR CAMERA IS GOOD FOR BACKING UP IN PARKING WE DID NOT FEEL THAT THE AUDI Q5 WITH A
I DON T BELIEVE THERE IS ANY CHANGE IN VISIBILITY WHEN I TURN ON AND OFF THE AUTOMATIC DIMMING REARVIEW MIRROR FEATURE
IT WILL BE NICE TO USE REAR CAMERA ALL THE TIME NOT JUST IN REVERSE MODE
GETTING USED TO VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES CAR SITS HIGHER THAN MY OLD CAR
THE DRIVERS OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR HAS AN ADDITIONAL CURVE AT THE OUTSIDE DIFFICULT TO SEE THE BENEFIT AND CAN BE CONFUSING
REALLY I THINK I JUST HAVEN T GOTTEN COMFORTABLE IN THE SEAT YET I KEEP ADJUSTING THE SEAT TRYING TO FIND THE BEST POSITION FOR VISIBILITY IN ALL AREAS I AM CONFIDENT I WILL GET THE POSITION CORRECTED I DO HAVE THE BACKUP CAMERA AND USE IT
MY CAR WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HID HEADLIGHTS BUT IT JUST HAD NORMAL ONES
REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCKS FORWARD VISION AROUND CURVES CLOVER LEAF EXCHANGES IS WHEN THIS COMES INTO PLAY AS YOUR IN THE SEMI CIRCLE I AM OVER SIX FEET TALL BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDES BUT THAT IS WHY YOU HAVE THE BLIND SPOT ALERT ON CAR
YOU NEED TO BE REALLY TALL TO GET A GREAT VISIBILITY FOR DRIVING
OVERALL VISIBILITY IS GOOD
REAR WIPER NEEDS TO CLEAR MORE SURFACE AREA
THE RAIN SENSING WIPERS KEEP YOUR VISION AT IT S OPTIMUM
SUN VISORS DO NOT COVER WELL GREAT VISIBILITY TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE AND SIDES ALMOST AS GOOD TOWARDS THE BACK
BEING HIGHER GIVES BETTER VISABILITY
THE SIDE WARNING SYSTEM IS NOT VERY GOOD CHECK OUT HOW MERCEDES DOES IT WHERE YOU CAN SEE THE YELLOW AND RED ARROWS IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THE BMW SYSTEM IS GENERALLY NEVER SEEN
VISIBILITY MUCH BETTER THAN MY 08 LEXUS RX AND 14 NISSAN MURANO
THE VISIBILITY AT THE RIGHT REAR CORNER IS VERY LIMITED THIS CAUSES SOME BLIND SPOTS WHILE CHANGING LANE
GREAT VISSION ESPECIALLY ON SIDE REAR COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES LOOKED AT BEFORE BUYING AND SAFETY SIDE CAR ALERT WORKS AMAZING ALREADY SAVED A POTENTIAL OOPS ONCE ON HIGHWAY
AS OLDER ADULT I LIKE THE FORWARD AND REAR VISIBILITY AND FEELING OF SAFETY
A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE OVER DRIVERS LEFT SHOULDER TO BLIND SPOT THE REAR VIEW WINDOW WOULD BE BETTER IF A LITTLE WIDER
THERE IS A VERY DEFINITE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
REAR VISIBILITY COULD BE BETTER BUT THERE IS A BACK UP CAMERA INCLUDED
THE SIZE PLACEMENT OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS CAN SOMETIMES OBSCURE VISIBILITY
WHEN LOOKING OUT THE REAR PASSENGER WINDOW THE CURVE OF THE INSIDE INTERIOR PANEL CONFUSES ME INTO THINKING THERE IS A VEHICLE IN THE PASSENGER SIDE BLIND SPOT
FAR GREATER OVERALL VISIBILITY COMPARED TO THE NISSAN JUKE WE TRADED IN FOR THE X3
DRIVER MIRROR OBSTRUCTS VISION CREATE A BLIND SPOT TO THE LEFT MAYBE COULD BE PLACED LOWER
LOVE LED HEADLIGHTS AND CORNERING LIGHT FEATURE
A REAR MOUNTED CAMERA SHOWING THE TYPICAL BLIND SPOT AREA PERHAPS SHOWN ON THE DASH DISPLAY ONLY WHEN THERE IS TRAFFIC IN THE BLIND SPOT WOULD BE GREAT DRIVERS WOULD QUICKLY BECOME USED TO GLANCING QUICKLY TO THE DASH PANEL SCREEN TO CHE
WE D LOVE IF THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION LIGHT WAS A BIT MORE VISIBLE
NOT HAPPY WITH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS THE WINDOW WASHING SPRAY DOESN T REACH THE ENTIRE WINDOW THE PASSENGER WIPER ALWAYS LEAVES STREAKS AND THE INTERMITTENT WIPER DOESN T DETECT THE RAIN WELL I CONSTANTLY HAVE TO OVERRIDE AND MANUALLY C
THERE IS A LARGE BLIND SPOT IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR IT IS MITIGATED BY HAVING THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR BUT IS STILL DISCONCERTING
THE LED HEADLIGHTS ARE EXCELLENT
VISIBILITY IS EXCEPTIONAL FOR THE SIZE OF THE X 5
THE CAMERAS UNDER THE SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD BE ANGLED AND SHOW LITTLE BEYOND MIRROR S VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES
I RATED THE VISIBILITY OF CHANGING LANES SO POORLY AS I M NOT A TALL WOMAN SO THE SIDE DOOR PANELS BLOCK MY LINE OF VISION AS WELL AS THE PLACEMENT OF THE SIDE MIRROR IT S SOMETHING I VE GOTTEN USED TO BUT I HAVE TO CAREFULLY VIEW AND REVIEW WH
WOULD LIKE BETTER VISIBILITY OUT OF CARGO AREA SIDE WINDOWS FOR SWITCHING LANES
NO CONCERNS ABOUT VISIBILITY AND THE VEHICLE FEELS VERY SAFE
THE SOMEWHAT REFLECTIVE SURFACE OF THE FINISH ADJACENT TO THE BACK SIDE WINDOW SOMETIMES RESEMBLES A CAR IN THE BLIND SPOT AT FIRST GLANCE
REAR VISIBILITY NOT IDEAL
THE DRIVER ASSISTANCE PLUS PACKAGE IS GREAT THE HEADS UP DISPLAY UNIT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONES REALLY LIKE HAVING POSTED SPEED LIMIT INCLUDED IN THE HUD
EXTERIOR MIRRORS WITH BLIND SPOT WARNING NOT GOOD ENOUGH DUE SMALL BSW
REAR VISIBILITY LESS THAN MY PRIOR CAR X5
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A BLIND SPOT ON SIDE TOWARDS BACK AND SMALL SIDE MIRRORS DOES NOT HELP
THE FRONT PASSENGER HEADREST CAN BE ANNOYING WHEN BACKING UP SINCE IT HINDERS THE DRIVER VISIBILITY
THE 435 OFFERS MORE COMFORT AND DRIVING SAFETY THAN ANY OF THE PREVIOUS FIVE BMWS AND HAVE OWNED IN THE PAST 635 735 300 335 AND BAVARIA
REAR BLIND SPOTS ARE SIGNIFICANT
ITS A CONVERTIBLE SO EXPECT COMPROMISED VISIBILITY
I M 5 8 AND HAVE NO VISIBILITY ISSUES
SUN VISORS ARE DECORATIVE ONLY AND BLIND SPOTS WHEN TOP IS UP MAKES IT DIFFICULT WHEN CHANGING LANES
WAS SO GLAD WHEN THEY PUT THE SENSORS ON THE MIRROR THESE VEHICLES HAVE BAD BLIND SPOTS I LOVE THE NEW SENSORS
SUN VISORS ARE TOO SMALL AND REAR HEADRESTS BLOCK REAR VIEW
SEEMS TO BE BIG BLIND SPOTS
TERRIBLE REAR VISIBILITY
I AM 5 FT 2 IN I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OVER THE HOOD IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE SEAT COULD BE RAISED A BIT HIGHER ALSO THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR BLOCKS MY VISIBILITY
REAR VIEW MIRROR BLOCK FRONT VISIBILITY
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SEEM INADEQUATE EITHER IN SIZE OR STYLING CAN T TELL
THE WIPERS WASHERS HAS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT WINDSHIELD WIPERS FREQUENCY FOR EXAMPLE
VEHICLE FEELS SOLID AND SAFE TO DRIVE BUT DUE TO THE NATURE OF IT BEING A COUPE CAN BE DIFFICULT TO SEE AT TIMES BLIND SPOTS SEEM LARGER THAN MY PREVIOUS CAR THE SUN VISORS ARE ALSO TOO SMALL AND CHEAP MY OLD CAR HAD A MIRROR AND A USEFUL LIGH
I M FAIRLY TALL BUT THE LOWERMOST READOUTS ARE BARELY VISIBLE OVER THE BULGE OF THE STEERING COLUMN UNLESS I CRANE BY HEAD UPWARD TO PEER OVER IT I DON T THINK MY SEAT IS SET TO AN UNUSUAL ANGLE
LARGE SIDE BLIND SPOTS
I DON T LIKE THE FEATURE THAT LOWERS THE RIGHT REAR OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN IN REVERSE
NO BLIND SPOT
IIHS CRASH TESTING RESULTS FEELING OF SAFETY WHEN DRIVING THE VEHICLE
EXCEPTIONAL ALL AROUND VISIBILITY
NO REAR VIEW CAMERA
I WISH THEY HAD PUT A REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER I REALLY MISS THAT THE FRONT WINDSHIELD REAR VIEW MIRROR ASSEMBLY STALK COULD BE MADE LESS BULKIER TO IMPROVE FORWARD VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT THE SUNROOF SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPEN COMPLETELY T
POOR LOW BEAM VISIBILITY
THE A PILLARS COULD BE A BIT NARROWER BRIEFLY LOST A PEDESTRIAN AT A STOP LIGHT
REAR VIEW IS TERRIBLE
I WISH THE INTERACTIVE DRIVER SAFETY PACKAGE LANE DRIFT WARNING BLIND SPOT INDICATORS ETC INCLUDED SELF PARKING AND SELF BRAKING
CORNER VISIBILITY AND REAR BLIND SPOTS
THE SHAPE OF THE BACK WINDOW LIMITS VISIBILITY I KNOW IT IS THE STYLING OF THE VEHICLE THAT DOES THAT SO WE WILL OWN IT
VIRTUALLY NO BLIND SPOTS IF YOUR MIRRORS ARE SET UP CORRECTLY
SHAPE OF THE REAR LIMITS VISIBILITY SLIGHTLY IT LOOKS SO GOOD THIS SLIGHT INCONVENIENCE
HEADLIGHTS AT NIGHT POSITIONED TOO HIGH SO ONCOMING DRIVERS BELIEVE BRIGHTS ARE ENGAGED HEADLIGHT WASHERS NICE TO HAVE BUT MIST SPRAYS ALL OVER HOOD WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL USE
SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES IN THIS VEHICLE
VISIBILITY MUCH BETTER THAN IN FORMER CAR
SIDE MIRRORS CREATE POOR VISIBILITY ALL OVER ITS NECESSARY TO ADJUST YOUR HEAD BODY ETC IN ORDER TO GET A CLEAR VIEW
SEEMS TO HAVE BLIND SPOTS
GOOD TO HAVE BACK UP CAMERA BECAUSE OF POOR VISIBILITY OUT OF REAR WINDOWS OUR OTHER ENCLAVE DID NOT HAVE AND BACKING WAS VERY RISKY ALSO APPROACHING VEHICLE SIGNAL IS GREAT HAVEN T FOUND SIGNAL FOR VEHICLE AHEAD TO BE REAL USEFUL BUT MAYBE
IT SHOULD HAVE SOME CRASH AVOIDANCE FEATURES ESPECIALLY BLIND SPOT MONITORS AVAILABLE I CAN GET THOSE IN A $24K MAZDA
EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD VISIBILITY FOR 360 DEGREES
THE BRAKES AND VISIBILITY ARE OUTSTANDING AND ASSIST IN AVOIDING ACCIDENTS
THE SAFETY FEATURES ARE SPECTACULAR LANE DEPARTURE WARNING BLIND SPOT WARNING AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL HARE MOST APPRECIATED
LIKE REAR VIEW CAMERA BETTER IF IT WAS IN REAR VIEW MIRROR
GOOD REAR VIEW MIRRORS PROVIDE GOOD VIEW OF CARS IN ADJACENT LANES
VEHICLE APPEARS TO BE FINE IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET USED TO THE NEW DETECTION FEATURES AND REAR CAMERA
THE SIZE OF THE FRONT WINDOW POSTS COMBINED WITH THE SIZE OF THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE ABSOLUTE SAFETY ISSUES HUGE FORWARD BLIND SPOTS WHEN TURNING AT NIGHT THAT PROBLEM PLUS NO SIDE LIGHTING IS A REAL PROBLEM
THE DASH SCREENS DISPLAY A LOT OF INFORMATION BUT IT IS COMPLEX AND REQUIRES TAKING EYES OFF THE ROAD SEARCHING FOR THE RIGHT DISPLAY HAVING TWO SCREENS TO VIEW ADDS TO THE ISSUE
BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING
REAR VISIBILITY IS VERY LOW ESPECIALLY FOR THE RIGHT SIDE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE WITH THE CAR
FRONT PILLERS TOO WIDEFOR GOOD SIDE VISIBILITY
THESE CARS HAVE LIMITED REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY ALTHOUGH HAVING THE BACK UP CAMERA DOES HELP A GREAT DEAL THE HIGH REAR DECK DOES COMPROMISE THAT VIEW I REALLY MISS MY S FEATURE WITH SIDE MIRRORS WHICH AUTOMATICALLY TILTED DOWN WHEN BACK
REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY FOR THE DRIVER ARE NOT VERY IDEAL
THE REAR VISIBILITY NEEDS TO BE INCREASED WINDOW IS TOO SMALL
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE HUGE YOU COULD HAVE AN 18 WHEELER IN THE AREA BETWEEN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND THE WINDSHIELD AND NOT SEE IT
HARD TO GET THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS ADJUSTED TO CORRECTLY VIEW THE SIDE AND DRIVEWAY NEED TO MAKE MIRRORS WIDER UP DOWN TO SEE REAR VIEW CORRECTLY
LOVE THE SAFETY FEATURES AND FEEL LANE DEPARTURE WARNING MAKES ME A BETTER DRIVER THE VIBRATING SEAT IS EXCELLENT WAY OF NOTIFYING DRIVER OF ISSUES
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME KIND OF WINDOW ON THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER FRONT SIDES FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF SEEING THINGS IN THE BLIND SPOT SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THE VERANO I FEEL THIS WOULD HELP SHORTER PEOPLE TO SEE THINGS IN THE BLIND SPOT IN OLD
DIFFICULT TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES IN THE LANE NEXT TO ME AND SLIGHTLY BEHIND ME I M NOT YET FULLY CONFIDENT ABOUT THE SIDE MIRROR BLIND SPOT INDICATORS AND SO THE LACK OF VISIBILITY IS NOTICEABLE AT THIS EARLY STAGE
SIDE MIRROR BLIND SPOTS NEXT CAR I GET WILL DEFINTELY HAVE THE AUTOMATIC WARNING DEVICE SHOULD BE ON ALL MODELS
I FIND THAT AS I USE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA MORE I WILL RELY ON IT MORE
THERE IS A LARGE FRONT BLINDSPOT IN THIS CAR
BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL BMW VEHICLES BASED ON THEIR REPUTATION FOR SAFETY AND EXCLUSIVITY BUT AS THE X4 AND X6 HAVE A SIGHT LIMITING FASTBACK DESIGN BLIND SPOT WARNING SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BY STANDARD
SIZE OF WIPERS ARE GREAT BUT THE QUALITY OF WIPER BLADES WERE TERRIBLE DURING THE WINTER WEATHER AND HAD TO REPLACE THEM WITHIN 3 WEEKS OF BUYING THE VEHICLE
OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER VISIBILITY IS PARTIALLY OBSTRUCTED BY THE PILLAR BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR SIDE WINDOWS
THIS IS THE FIRST VEHICLE I HAVE OWNED IN A WHILE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THE MIRROR MOUNTED LED TURN INDICATORS THIS FEATURE IMPROVES VISIBILITY FOR OTHERS TO SEE THE CAR TURNING AND IMPROVES SAFETY WHEN TURNING DISAPPOINTED IT IS NOT A FEATURE ON
I FEEL THAT THERE IS POOR VISIBILITY THE SHAPE OF THE WINDOWS AND BACK SEAT HEADRESTS CUT DOWN ON OUTSIDE VISIBILITY IN OTHER WORDS MY VIEW IS BLOCKED
REAR VIEW IS RESTRICTED
MY LAST BUICK VERANO HAD BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND LANE DEPARTURE THESE SHOULD BE STANDARD NOT OPTIONAL ON ALL BUICKS THAT ALONE WOULD CREATE ADDED VALUE TO ME UNFORTUNATELY UNTIL I HAD SIGNED ALL PAPERS I DID NOT REALIZE THIS REGAL DID NO
THE ANGLE OF THE FRONT POST BETWEEN THE SIDE WINDOWS AND THE WINDSHIELD HAS BLOCKED MY VISION OF ONCOMING CROSS TRAFFIC SEVERAL TIMES
I FEEL THAT I HAVE LESS VISIBILITY THAN MY PREVIOUS MALIBU I HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH THE BLIND SPOT
NEED TO WORK ON BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS THAT SIDE MIRRORS DON T COVER LIMITED VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES IS MY PRIMARY COMPLAINT OF THIS VEHICLE
THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES OF THE WINDSHIELD SEEM OVERLY WIDE CAUSING SOME VISIBILITY ISSUES
THERE IS MOLDING ON BOTH SIIDES OF THE WINDSHIELD WHICH SOMEWHAT CREATE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES THANKFULLY THERE IS A WARNING SYSTEM TO WARN THE DRIVER IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS
LOTS OF WINDOWS TO ASSIST WITH BLIND SPOTS
VISIBILITY WAS THE PRIMARY SELLING ISSUE AT TEST DRIVE TIME
I LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THAT IT SHOWS THE ARC OF A TURN AND WHETHER YOU HAVE CLEARANCE OR NOT IT ALSO SHOWS THE DISTANCE TO MY REAR BUMPER IN THE GRID WHICH IS VERY NICE THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALERTS HAVE ALSO BEEN USEFUL WHEN BACKING OU
FRONT WIND WINDOWS HAVE A FORWARD BLIND SPOT I LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A SIDE WINDOW VENT BUT THIS SECTION BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND FRONT SIDE WINDOWS HAS A BLIND SPOT THAT YOU MUST LOOK AROUND THIS IS THE ONLY FLAW I SEE IN THE CAR
LIGHTING PACKAGE WITH XENON AND HEADLIGHT TRACKING IS AMAZING GREAT FOR NIGHT DRIVING
THE FOG LIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL
THE VEHICLES ON THE CAMERA MAKE IT EASIER TO DRIVE AND MAKES ME FEEL MORE SECURE ON THE ROAD PARKING IS NICE
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT BETWEEN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD & DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW
THE BLINDSPOT DETECTION DOES NOT SEEM TO COME ON AS SOON AS IT SHOULD
THE SUN VISORS ARE NOT LARGE ENOUGH THEY SHOULD EXTEND ALL THE WAY TO THE REAR VIEW MIRROR AND BE DEEPER IN WIDTH SO IT COVERS MORE OF THE WINDSHIELD FOR SHORTER DRIVERS BEING I AM ONLY 5 3 AND 1 2 TALL THE SUN VISORS IN CARS ARE NEVER DEEP E
LANE CHANGING WARNING IS A MUST SAFETY FUNCTION WHICH HELPING DRIVER TO AVOID ACCIDENT
A FRONT VIEW CAMERA WOULD BE NICE TOO TO TOGGLE OFF   ON WHEN NEEDED THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA IS VERY HELPFUL SO WHY NOT PUT ONE FOR THE FRONT VIEW AND ALLOW THE DRIVER TO TURN OFF ON AS NEEDED
I LOVE THE HEADS UP DISPLAY
SINCE I DRIVE SHORT DISTANCES LOCALLY I FEEL LESS SECURE ABOUT LANE CHANGES I FEEL THAT I HAVE BLIND SPOTS AND NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL BECAUSE THE CAR HAS A LOW PROFILE
DIFFICULT TO LOOK OUT THE REAR WINDOW WHEN BACKING UP MUST RELY ON THE REAR CAMERA
BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER REAR SIDE
SHORTER PEOPLE HAVE MORE BLIND SPOTS
I SPECIAL ORDERED THIS VEHICLE TO ENSURE THE EYE SIGHT SYSTEM WAS INSTALLED THE BLIND SPOT WARNING IS ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE A SOUND ALONG WITH THE WARNING LIGHT IN THE SIDE MIRROR WOULD BE THE HELPFUL
THE REAR WINDOW AND THE REAR CAMERA LENS GET COVERED WITH DIRT VERY QUICKLY WHEN DRIVING ON DIRT ROADS
PASSENGER DOOR POST AND HEAD REST PLACEMENT CREATE MAJOR BLIND SPOT
THE WORST WINDSHIELD WIPERS OF ANY CAR THAT I HAVE EVER DRIVEN RAIN SNOW AND DIRT GET PUSHED TO THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDOW AND WIPERS DO NOT CLEAR WELL
FOG LIGHTS COME ON WHEN TURNING AT NIGHT IS VERY HELPFUL
DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS ARE DIMMED HIGH BEAMS THEY SHOULD BE DEDICATED LED S
THATS WHY I CHOOSE THIS VEHICLE BECAUSE OF THE VISIBILITY
THE EYESIGHT SYSTEM IS AMAZING I WILL NEVER PURCHASE A CAR WITHOUT ADAPTIVE CRUISE AGAIN
THE REAR SEAT WINDOWS ARE A LITTLE SMALL OR TOO SLANTED FOR GREAT VISIBILITY
THE REAR WIPER SYSTEM IS WEAK DOES NOT CLEAN WELL
ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS I VE BEEN A LONG TIME SUBARU DRIVER IS BECAUSE OF THE SAFETY OF THE CAR
WE HAD TO APPLY RAIN EX TO THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR WINDOW AND SIDE MIRROR OTHERWISE THE WATER FLOW OBSCURED MIRROR VISIBILITY
OVER ALL VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD
THE VISIBILITY IN THIS CAR IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING THERE IS NOT ONE SINGLE BLIND SPOT MY ONLY COMPLAINT IN THIS SECTION IS THE SUN VISORS DO NOT EXTENT OUT SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THE SUN IS ON MY SIDE AND I MOVE THE VISOR TO MY SIDE I CANT EXTEND IT FU
I WISH THE DRIVER S SIDE AND PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR WERE MORE OF A WIDER ANGLE FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
REAR VIEW MIRROR PLACED TOO LOW ON WINDSHIELD CREATES HUGE BLIND SPOT IN FORWARD FIELD OF VIEW FOR TALLER DRIVERS
EVERYTHING IS PRETTY SOLID FROM A VISIBILITY AND SAFETY STANDPOINT
THE WING IS LESS OBTRUSIVE THAN YOU D THINK AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY THE UN CRASHABILITY OF THE CAR AWD LIMITED SLIP DIFFERENTIALS BIG BRAKES STIFF SUSPENSION BUT NOT THE ELECTRONICS LIKE THE TRACTION CONTROL IS ITS SELLING POINT TO ME
HARD TO SEE OUT REAR WINDOW WHEN BACKING UP VISIBILITY IS LIMITED BY STABILIZATION FIN AND REAR CENTER BRAKE LIGHT
VERY POOR HEADLIGHTS WILLING TO PAY MORE BUT NEED BETTER INTENSITY HEADLIGHT LOW BEAMS CANNOT SEE PROPERLY DURING RAIN IN NIGHT
I WOULD RATHER HAVE HID HEADLIGHTS THAN THE LED HEADLIGHTS LEDS ARE NO WHERE NEAR AS BRIGHT AS HID HEADLIGHTS
I KNOW IT ISN T IN STYLE BUT I WOULD MUCH RATHER LOOK OUT THE BACK WINDOW THAN VIEW A PIECE OF THE ACTION THROUGH A CAMERA BUT BACK WINDOW ON ALL SUV S ARE TOO HIGH TOO SMALL
THE LENS ON THE BACKUP CAMERA IS TOO EASILY OBSCURED BY RAIN AND GRIME
EYESIGHT SAFETY FEATURES A GREAT SUPPLEMENTAL FEATURE TO NORMAL DRIVER AWARENESS
DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT BACK SIDE WINDOWS WHEN CHANGING LANES DUE TO BLIND SPOTS
I WENT FROM DRIVING A JEEP WRANGLER 2002 TO DRIVING THE SUBARU OUTBACK REAR VISIBILITY IN THE TJ WAS OUTSTANDING MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OTHER VEHICLE I VE DRIVEN AND I GOT USED TO THAT COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLES I VE DRIVEN IN THE PAST I RENT C
TOP OF THE LINE MODEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH XENON HEADLIGHTS
REAR VISIBILITY BLOCKED BY HEADRESTS OF BACKSEATS WOULD BE NICE IF THERE WAS A SWITCH TO HAVE THE HEADRESTS GO DOWN WHERE THERE ARE NO PASSENGERS
MY OVERALL CONFIDENCE IN DRIVING MY LEGACY IS AMAZING AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DRIVING THE CAR EVERY DAY THE ONLY THING IN WHICH I FEEL SHOULD BE RECONSIDERED IS THE LOCATION OF THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR INDICATOR IN THE AUTO DIMMING MIRROR EQUIPPED C
REAR VISIBILITY IS LACKING BUT THE SIZE OF THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AND BACKUP CAMERA HELP
GREAT FORWARD VISIBILITY AND SAFETY ITEMS STANDARD
GREAT VISIBILITY SAFETY IS IN THE HANDS OF THE DRIVER AND HIS ATTENTION TO CARS AROUND HIM
VISIBILITY IN THIS VEHICLE IS FANTASTIC THE SMALL WINDOWS NEXT TO THE MIRRORS REALLY OPEN UP THE CAR THE STRUT BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR DOOR IS THE ONLY ASPECT THAT DETRACTS FROM THE VISIBILITY BUT THAT IS MOSTLY DUE TO MY HEIGHT AND SEAT POSI
OUTSTANDING VISIBILITY CONFIDENCE INSPIRING VEHICLE
REAR WINDOW TINTED MAKES VISIBILITY WITH REARVIEW MIRROR DIFFICULT SOMETIMES BUT STILL GETTING USE TO BACKUP CAMERA I VE NEVER HAD THIS FEATURE ON A CAR BEFORE SO JUST TAKES SOME TIME TO GAIN A COMFORTABILITY LEVEL WITH THIS NEW FEATURE
ORIGINAL HEADLIGHT BULBS PUT OUT VERY POOR LIGHT
I PREFER RAIN SENSOR AND AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS
DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS IN YOUR BLINDSPOT BUT BLINDSPOT MAKES UP FOR THAT
VISIBILITY IS ABOVE AVERAGE I HAVE ALMOST NO BLIND SPOTS AND FEEL VERY SAFE WHILE DRIVING MY 4RUNNER
CAR OFFERS BETTER VISIBILITY THAN EXPECTED
REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE A BIT TO SMALL NOTICEABLY SMALLER THAN THE CAMRY THAT I HAD BEFORE
COULD HAVE BETTER HEADLIGHTS FOR BOTH BASE AND PREMIUM MODELS POSSIBLY AN OPTION FOR HID OR LED HEADLIGHTS
THE WRX HAS EXCELLENT VISIBILITY COMPARED TO MY LAST CAR
TO EFFECTIVELY SEE OUT OF THE VEHICLE I FEEL THAT THE REAR CAMERA AND LANE CHANGING NOTIFICATIONS ARE NECESSARY THERE ARE PRETTY BIG BLIND SPOTS FOR BACKING UP AND CHANGING LANES
I HAVE OWNED EVERY GENERATION OF THE WRX STI SINCE THE 2002 MODEL AND THE HAS THE BEST VISIBILITY OVER THE PREVIOUS GENERATIONS BY FAR
TOUGH TO SEE HOW CLOSE THE REAR OF VEHICLE IS WHEN BACKING UP WITHOUT USING BACKUP CAMERA
NEVER THOUGHT I D USE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING BUT IT AND THE CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT SYSTEM COME IN HANDY ALL THE TIME
THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS WONDERFUL
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING PRIOR TO CHANGING LANES
WHEN CHANGING LANES AND A VEHICLE IS IN THE BLIND SPOT AND I HAVE NOT NOTICED THE LIGHT ON THE SIDE MIRROR IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE AND AUDIBLE ALARM TO ALERT ME SOMETIMES CHANGING LANES IS A QUICK DECISION WHICH CAN LEAD TO AN ACCIDENT
BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND CROSS TRAFFIC ALERTS WORK VERY WELL AND ARE A GREAT SAFETY FEATURE
WOULD NOT CHANGE ANYTHING FEELS SAE AND HAS MULTIPLE SAFETY FEATURES
THE BACK UP CAMERA IS MANDATORY TO AVOID HITTING OBJECTS WHEN BACKING
LOVE THE HEADLIGHTS AUTO DIMMING AND ESPECIALLY THE SIDE VEHICLE WARNINGS WONDERFUL WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE IN A BUSY SHOPPING AREA WOULD HAVE GREATLY APPRECIATED DUAL VISORS FOR THE DRIVER ALLOWING SUN SHIELD IN FRONT AND ON TH
PLEASE ADD THE PARK ASSIST BEEPERS TO THE AVALON IN THE FUTURE THEY ARE IN MY OPINION BETTER THAN THE REAR VIEW CAMERA THE LINES ON THE CAMERA ARE DIFFICULT TO USE BUT MAYBE I LL GET USED TO THEM
IT SEEMS LIKE THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE SMALL AND AS I SIT AS FAR BACK AS THE SEAT WILL GO THE MIRRORS SEEMS TO NOT CAPTURE MUCH COMPARED TO MY TRUCK
BLIND SPOT LIMITATION AS STATED PREVIOUSLY
WITHOUT THE BACKUP CAMERA AND WARNING OF PASSING CAR BACKING UP IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT DUE TO REAR CORNER POST AND FRONT SEATS USE BOTH CAMERA WARNINGS AND THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
I AM SHORT SO WISH THE VISOR WAS A LITTLE LONGER IT DOESN T QUITE HELP ME WHEN THE SUN ANGLE IS BAD LOW I ALSO WISH THE BACK UP CAMERA ALSO HAD A AUDIO WARNING NOTIFICATION IF YOU GET TOO CLOSE TO SOMETHING MY HUSBAND S TRUCK COMES WITH A BACK
THE AVALON IS CONSIDERED THE TOP OF THE LINE FOR THE TOYOTA BRAND AND TOP LINE NEW CARS ALWAYS COME EQUIPPED WITH DRLS DRLS ARE A MUST FOR SAFETY BUT OF THE 4 DIFFERENT TOYOTA HYBRID TRIM MODELS ONLY THE TOP MODEL COMES EQUIPPED WITH DRLS SI
HEADS UP DISPLAY WOULD BE NICE
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT BUT THIS IS THE NATURE OF CAR DESIGNS TODAY I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY NEWER CARS WHERE THE SIGHT LINES ARE AS GOOD AS THEY WERE SAY 15 YEARS AGO
THE SUN VISOR WILL BENEFIT FROM GETTING REDESIGNED THE CURRENT MODEL IS TOO SMALL AND DOES NOT OFFER SUN PROTECTION I CHANGED FROM A CHEVROLET I LOVE THE FACT THAT THE CAMRY HAS THE SAME GOOD REAR VISIBILITY
WITHOUT CAMERA AND MARKING IN DISPLAY TO ASSIST BACK UP AND PARKING WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT
SEEM TO HAVE BLIND SPOTS WHEN TURNING MY HEAD TO LEFT
BLIND SPOT WHEN DRIVER IS LOOKING RIGHT FOR TRAFFIC
THE BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGERS SIDE IS AN ISSUE FOR ME THE REAR AREA BLOCKS MY VIEW A LITTLE MORE THAN I WOULD LIKE IT TO I AM GETTING USED TO IT HOWEVER THE NEWER AIRODINAMIC DESIGN WITH THE CAR ROOF LOWER TO THE GROUND TAKES A LITTLE TO
I CAN SEE BUT I HAVEN T GOTTEN USE TO THE CAMERA BACKING UP
VISIBILITY OUT OF THE RIGHT SIDE WINDOWS WHEN ENTERING A ROAD IS VERY POOR
LACK OF BACK WINDSHIELD WIPER IS SOMETIMES BAD ESPECIALLY WHEN ROAD SALT ACCUMULATES ON THE WINDSHIELD
I MISS THE FOG LIGHTS THESE WERE EXCEPTIONAL ON MY CAMRY THEY PROVIDED A HUGE SWATHE OF LIGHT ACROSS GROUND AND SIDES WHEN DRIVING IN THE FOG AND IN THE COUNTRY AT NIGHT
REAR WINDOW DISTORTION WHEN USED WITH TINT NISSING TECH FOR LANE DEPARTURE HEADS UP DISPLAY ETC
I THINK THE DOOR MIRRORS SHOULD HAVE A BUILT IN BLIND SPOT MIRROR AS A STANDARD INSTALL
10 AIR BAGS WOW WHAT MORE CAN YOU SAY I FEEL AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE
AS STATED PRIOR HEADROOM IS LOW AND THE VISOR CUTS DOWN ON VISIBILITY WHEN THE VISOR IS IN USE
CAMRY RATED HIGH IN SAFETY AND THAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME AND MY FAMILY
SOMETHING IS AMISS WITH THE BLIND SPOTS AS CARS APPROACH BOTH DRIVER & PASSENGER SIDES FROM DRIVER S SEAT
FOR THE PRICE IT SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS OR WARNING SYSTEM FOR APPROACHING VEHICLES NOT FEATURED WELL FOR THE PRICE I PAID IF I COULD I WOULD TAKE IT BACK FOR A CHEVY TRAVERSE WHICH OFFERS MORE ROOM AND MORE FEATURES FOR THE SAME MONEY
LOVE THE LOW BEAM HEADLIGHTS GREAT VISIBILITY WAY TO GO TOYOTA LOVE REAL VIEW CAMERA CAN T SEE THE SCREEN FOR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA WHEN SUN IS SHINING ON SCREEN BUT DON T KNOW IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT THAT
I SEEM TO HAVE A CLOSED IN FEELING INSIDE THE CAR BECAUSE THERE IS MORE METAL AND LESS GLASS AROUND ME BUT THAT IS PROBABLY AN EXCELLENT SAFETY FEATURE THAT I REALLY SHOULDN T COMPLAIN ABOUT
WITHOUT THE BACKUP CAMERA REAR VISIBILITY WOULD BE A REAL CONCERN
THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS GOOD BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE HUGE BLIND SPOTS IN THIS CAR OUT THE FRONT SIDE AND REAR SIDE
COLLISION AVOIDANCE LANE CHANGE SENSORS SHOULD BE STANDARD ON THE XLE MODEL DUE TO BLIND SPOTS
VIEW TO THE RIGHT FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT IS PARTIALLY OBSTRUCTED BY POST AND HEADREST COMBINATION MUST RELY ON SIDE MIRROR MORE THAN DIRECT VIEW THE BACK UP CAMERA IS A HELPFUL TOOL
REALLY LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA AND IT S MARKINGS TO ASSIST WITH VEHICLE PLACEMENT
WHERE THE HATCHBACK WINDOW COMES TOGETHER WITH THE LOWER PART OF THE HATCHBACK WINDOW IT BLOCKS THE CAR BEHIND YOU HEADLIGHTS THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER ONLY WIPES THE DRIVERS SIDE BUT NOT THE WHOLE WINDOW
REAR VIEW IS DIFFICULT ALSO BECAUSE I M SHORT AND THUS HAVE THE DRIVERS SEAT HIGH UP WHICH THEY LET YOU DO TO A VERY NICE HIGH HEIGHT SOMETIMES THE SUN VISOR FEELS LIKE IT S OBSTRUCTING MY VIEW
VISIBILITY OF PASSENGER SIDE REAR NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
REAR WINDOW IS HARD TO KEEP CLEAN OF SNOW EVEN WHEN USING WIPERS BECAUSE THE WIPERS DO NOT CLEAN THE ENTIRE WINDOW THE SMALL REAR WINDOW IS VERY HARD TO SEE OUT OF IN BAD SNOWY WEATHER HARD TO KEEP CLEAN SO VISABILITY IS OPTIMAL VISABILITY I
THE BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHILE DRIVING WITHOUT THE LDA ITS A PAIN DRIVING THIS VEHICLE
I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY BLIND SPOTS
LIKE THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF THIS CAR
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES MUST USE BOTH VISUAL AS WELL AS SIDE MIRRORS
I LIKE THE EXTRA VISIBILITY IN THE REAR LIFT GATE
REAR MIRROR VISIBILITY IS POOR WITH DIVIDED REAR HATCHBACK
MERGING INTO RIGHT HAND TRAFFIC IS HARD TO SEE THRU THE BACK WINDOWS FORWARD VISIBILITY IS HAMPERED BY THE WINDSHIELD SUPPORT POST WHILE MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN
WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE LANE DEPARTING AND FORWARD COLLISION SYSTEM AS A REGULAR SAFETY FEATURE
GOTTA BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE REAR
THERE ARE 2 PIECES OF GLASS IN THE REAR VIEW DIVIDED BY A SPOILER THE BOTTOM GLASS GETS DIRTY AND IS HARD TO SEE OUT OF CAN THERE BE A SMALL WIPER PUT THERE
THE SIDE MIRRORS SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE THEY IMPEDE VISIBILITY I ALSO WISH THAT THE REAR WINDOW WAS LARGER LIKE IN PREVIOUS MODELS
BIG BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING TO CHANGE LANES
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR
THE PASSENGER SIDE AIRBAG WHICH RUNS ALONG THE SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD IS A VIEW OBSTRUCTION IT CREATES A BLINDSPOT WHICH I FIND I HAVE TO DELIBERATELY LEAN FORWARD IN ORDER TO SEE PROPERLY
MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY THAN MY PRIUS
BLIND SPOT IN REAR VIEW MIRROR THE MIRROR SHOULD BE BETTER OR HAVE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR
NOT ONLY ARE THERE BLIND SPOTS THE FRONT DRIVER SIDE MIRROR BLOCKS VIEW OF CARS IN FRONT OF YOU VERY DANGEROUS
BLIND SPOTS AT REAR SIDES WHEN CHANGING LANES
THERE SHOULD BE AN OPTION FOR A DONUT OR SPARE TIRE OTHERWISE GETTING STRANDED IS A REAL POSSIBILITY REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT GREAT WITH THE SPLIT WINDSHIELD
THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER IS USELESS
I PUT THE SMALL CLOSE MIRRORS ON THE MIRRORS FOR ADDED SAFETY
THERE IS DEFINITELY A BLIND SPOT THAT I DIDN T HAVE WITH MY FORRESTER I NEED TO SIT ON A CUSHION TO SEE OUT AND I STILL FEEL I CAN T SEE ALL THAT WELL
VISIBILITY OF PASSING VEHICLES FROM DRIVER S SEAT COULD BE BETTER
WHEN I PASSED ON THE TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE I DIDN T REALIZE THAT THE BLIND SPOTS IN SUCH A VEHICLE COULD BE A REAL PROBLEM I NOW THINK THAT FOR SAFETY S SAKE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR AND WARNING SHOULD COME AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT
HEADLIGHT HIGH BEAMS ARE BARELY ADEQUATE
FRONT SIDE POSTS BLOCK TOO MUCH AREA CREATE BLIND SPOT
REAR VISIBILITY IS COMPROMISED BY TAILGATE DESIGN
BIG BLINDSPOT AT SIDES OF WINDSHIELD
THE ONLY COMPLAINT THAT I HAVE IS THAT THE REAR COLUMNS IN THE VEHICLE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE IN THE CAR S BLIND SPOT PERHAPS IF THEY WERE SOMEWHAT THINNER THAT WOULD INCREASE THE VISIBILITY OF THE VEHICLE
THE DRIVER S SIDE SUN VISOR SHOULD BE MADE TO SLIDE BACK WHEN YOU HAVE IT POSITIONED TO BLOCK THE SUN THROUGH THE DRIVER S DOOR WINDOW
LARGE SIDE MIRRORS ARE A DEFINITE PLUS SIDE VISIBILITY VERY GOOD AS WELL
I LOVE THE AUTOMATIC HIGH BEAMS AND THE WIDTH OF THE HEADLIGHT BEAMS ALLOWING ME TO SEE OUT OVER THE DITCHES ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD MAKES IT EASIER TO WATCH FOR ANIMALS OR PEDESTRIANS
DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE RIGHT SIDE WHEN PULLING INTO TRAFFIC BECAUSE OF THE THICKNESS OF THE PARTITION BETWEEN THE FRONT AND REAR SEATS WHERE THE AIRBAG IS IT S TOO WIDE TO SEE AROUND SAME FOR THE OUTSIDE MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE IT S LA
BLIND SPOT OVER DRIVER S RIGHT SHOULDER BLOCKED BY 2ND ROW HEADREST
IT WOULD BE UNSAFE WITHOUT THE BACK UP CAMERA
I LOVE THE LARGE BACKUP CAMERA AND THE LITTLE CARS THAT LIGHT UP ON THE REARVIEW MIRROR WHEN CAR IN YOUR BLIND SPOT
PLEASE COMMENTS ON REAR CAMERA AUDIO PING THAT THIS VAN MODEL SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH PLEASE SEE COMMENTRS ON AUDIO PING THAT THIS VAN MODEL SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH FOR BLIND SPOT MONITORING
I WAS EXPECTING A LARGE BLIND SPOT DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE SIDE WINDOWS AND SIZE OF THE C PILLAR THE REAR AND SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ALLOW FOR A PERFECT ADJUSTMENT TO MINIMIZE THE BLIND SPOT
NOT AS GOOD AS 2003 VISIBILITY SMALLER SIDE WINDOWS IN REAR LIKE THE BACKUP CAMERA FOR PARKING BACKING UP
THE FORWARD VISIBILITY OF THE CAR IS SIMPLY INCREDIBLE COUPLED WITH THE ABILITY TO RAISE THE HEIGHT OF THE POWER DRIVER S SEAT THIS CONTRIBUTES TO THE OVERALL FEELING OF SAFETY
VERY POOR BLIND SPOTS I HAD TO CHANGE MY SIDE MIRRORS AND LOOK AT THE BLIND SPOTS WHICH I HAVE NEVER HAD TO DO BEFORE THEY ARE JUST SO BIG AND THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS ARE TOO SMALL WHILE BACKING UP
PASSANGER SIDE BLIND SPOT DIFFICULT TO CHANGE LANES
VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT AND REAR VISIBILITY IS ENHANCED BY THE BACK UP CAMERA
I HAVE SERIOUS ISSUES WITH THE SIDE MOUNTED MIRRORS THEY SHOULD BE LARGER IF NOT LONGER I HAVE DIFFICULTY DEALING WITH BLIND SPOTS
DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE BACK DUE TO TINY WINDOWS AND NO BLIND SPOT MONITOR IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE LANES ALSO DIFFICULT WHEN PULLING BACKWARDS OUT OF DRIVE WAY
THE EXTRA PULL OUT ON THE VISOR IS AN EXCELLENT IDEA THEY WORK WONDERFULLY ALL OF THE GLASS ALLOWS FOR GREAT VISIBILITY I LOVE MY FORESTER
THERE IS NO ISSUE WITH REAR VISIBILITY WHEN DRIVING IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE BEHIND AND TO THE SIDE WHILE BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE I MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO PARK SO THAT I CAN PULL FORWARD OUT OF THE SPACE BECAUSE OF THIS
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER SEATS
DRIVER AND REAR LEFT COLUMN BLOCKS VIEW OF TRAFFIC BEHIND ON THE LEFT SIDE AND SIDE VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL TO COVER THE BLIND SPOT
IT S HARD TO SEE BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING TOWARDS THE LEFT SIDE THE BAR IS IN THE WAY AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK THROUGH THE SMALL WINDOWS IN THE SECOND ROW
THE REAR SEATS ARE HIGHER THAN THE FRONT SEATS MAKING VISIBILITY FROM THE BACK SEATS GREAT
THE VEHICLE DOES HAVE SOME PRETTY PRONOUNCED BLIND SPOTS AT YOUR TYPICAL REAR LEFT AND REAR RIGHT POSITIONS
REAR VISIBILITY WAS CRITICAL TO THE BUYING DECISION
LOVE THE EYESIGHT CAMERAS
VERY EASY TO SEE IN ALL DIRECTIONS LOVE THE GREAT VISIBILITY
SHOULD HAVE HAD BETTER MIRRORS TO ADDRESS BLIND SPOTS WE HAD TO PURCHASE ADD ON MIRRORS
THERE ARE NO BLIND SPOTS IN THIS CAR THIS IS WONDERFUL LOVE HAVING STANDARD TRANSMISSION OPTION
BEST OVERALL SAFETY FEELING OF ANY VEHICLE I HAVE EVER DRIVEN
I LOVE THE FOG LIGHTS ON THE SPORT EDITION
RELIABILITY AND A SOLID FEELING ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME I LOVE THE FEEL OF THIS CAR AND I LOVE SUBARU S REPUTATION FOR QUALITY AND SAFETY THIS WAS A BIG FACTOR IN MY PURCHASE DECISION NOT THE ONLY FACTOR BUT A BIG ONE
THE EYESIGHT IS A GREAT TOOL FOR THE VEHICLE
MY EXPECTATIONS OF A VEHICLE ARE VERY HIGH AS MY NORMAL MODE OF TRANSPORTATION IS A SPORT S CAR MEANT FOR SUPERIOR HANDLING AND PERFORMANCE THE SUBARU IS AN AMAZING CAR WITH GREAT VISIBILITY I M JUST USED TO A BETTER HANDLING VEHICLE
FIVE STAR CRASH TEST RATINGS
THE REAR HEAD RESTS GET IN THE WAY OF VISIBILITY THEY BLOCK PART OF MY REAR VISION WHEN DRIVING FORWARD
OF ALL THE CARS I HAVE OWNED OR TEST DRIVEN I FEEL THAT THE VISIBILITY REAR AND SIDE OF THE IMPREZA IS FAR SUPERIOR THOUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS RIGHT IN MY LINE OF SIGHT I DID GET USED TO IT QUICKLY AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM
ONE OF THE BETTER VEHICLES FOR VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY
SHOULD HAVE THE UPPER PORTION OF THE WINDSHIELD TINTED GREAT VISIBILITY BUT HARSH SUN TENDS TO INTERFERE WITH FORWARD VISION
I LOVE THE HOW OPEN THE VEHICLE FEELS AND HOW I CAN SEE OUT OF ALL THE WINDOWS NO BLIND SPOTS
SOMETIMES ON AN ICY AND SNOWY DAY EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE DEFOGGER ON THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT CLEAR THE FRONT WINDOW ON THE FIRST SWIPE THEY CLEAR ON THE SECOND SWIPE
DIFFICULT TO ELIMINATE OR REDUCE BLIND SPOT FOR LANE CHANGE BLIND SPOT CAMERAS WOULD BE A NICE ADDITION
THE ONLY BLIND SPOTS ARE IN THE BACK CORNERS THEY AREN T TERRIBLE BUT I HAVE TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME CHECKING BEFORE CHANGING LANES
THE REAR VIEW COULD BE A BIT BETTER BUT NOT AN ISSUE
INSIDE MIRROR LOCATION IS THE REASON THAT FORWARD VISIBILITY IS ONLY A 3
I BOUGHT THIS CAR DUE TO SAFETY
I LIKE THE SIDE LIGHTS WHEN TURNING THEY REALLY IMPROVE VISIBILITY
GOOD OVERALL VISIBILITY
EVEN WE IT THE WARNING SYSTEM WIDER ANGLE MIRRORS WOULD BE NICE
THE SIZE SHAPE AND ANGLE OF MIRRORS GIVES EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY TRACTION IN SLIPPERY WEATHER IS AMAZING BEST CAR I VE EVER OWNED
DRIVING VISIBILITY IS GREAT THE BACK WINDOW ISN T ALWAYS TO SEE OUT OF BUT THE BACK UP CAMERA IS EXCELLENT AND MORE THAN MAKES UP FOR IT
SUGGEST XENON ON HIGH BEAM TOO
SIDE MIRRORS DO NOT ALLOW ME TO ADJUST MY MIRRORS AS TO GET RID OF BLIND SPOTS
THE DOORS DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY LOCK WHEN DRIVING THE FRONT DOORS DO NOT OPEN FROM THE INSIDE IT THEY ARE LOCKED I FEEL THOSE ARE BOTH SAFETY CONCERNS IF IN AN ACCIDENT YOU SHOULDN T HAVE TO UNLOCK THE DOOR TO GET OUT
I FEEL THAT AS THE POPULATION OF DRIVERS GET OLDER THEY NEED THE HELP OF ALL THE SAFETY DEVICES THAT IS ON THIS CAR THIS IS ONE REASON WHY I TRADED IN MY LEGACY IS FOR THE SAFETY REASONS I LOVE THIS CAR
THE ACTIVE DRIVER ASSIST SYSTEMS EYESIGHT SRVD EXCEED EXPECTATIONS POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS 1 HID HEADLIGHTS AVAILABLE AT ALL TRIM LEVELS 2 OPTIONAL DIGITAL SPEEDOMETER VIA A SIMPLE HEAD UP DISPLAY HUD AVAILABLE AT ALL TRIM LEVELS
THE EYESIGHT DRIVER ASSIST TECHNOLOGY IS ONE OF THE BEST FEATURES OF MY OUTBACK THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD FEATURE ON ALL VEHICLES INCLUDING TRUCKS I NEVER REALIZED HOW OFTEN THE LANE DEPARTURE & SWAY IS ACTIVATED WHEN DRIVING MY BACK UP CAMERA
LOVE ALL THE SAFETY FEATURES MY ONLY GRIP IS HOW THEY RAISE THE COST OF THE CAR ALL SAFETY FEATURES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN EVERY VEHICLE MADE FOR INSTANCE THE EYESIGHT SAFETY FEATURE RAISES THE PRICE OF THE AUTO BY $2000 THAT SHOULDN T BE IF
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THE EYESIGHT FEATURE THIS IS A MUST HAVE FEATURE FOR ME FROM NOW ON THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL AND THE COLLISION BRAKING ARE FABULOUS
GREAT OVERALL VISIBILITY
I WISH THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR WORKED ALL THE TIME AND I M HAVING PROBLEMS RELATED TO SIDE MIRRORS FOGGING
REAR WIPERS WOULD BE NICE
THE BLIND SPOTS BETWEEN THE REAR SIDE WINDOWS AND REAR WINDOW ARE WAY TOO BIG
NO BAD COMMENTS LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA NOW THAT I M USED TO IT OTHERWISE VISIBILITY IS TYPICAL FOR STANDARD CAR
WHILE NEEDED THE BLIND SPOT MAGNIFIERS ON SIDE MIRRORS ARE DISTRACTING
THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE REAR CAMERA AND SIZE OF VIEWING SCREEN NOT ALWAYS EASY TO SEE INTO THE STREET WHEN BACKING OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY HOWEVER I NOW DEPEND MORE ON THE BACKUP CAMERA WHICH GIVES ME A MUCH BETTER VIEW
IMPROVE THE VISORS SO THEY BLOCK THE SUN ADD AN EXTENSION SO WE HAVE THE OPTION TO SLIDE IT TOWARD THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TURN ON THE FOG LIGHTS WITHOUT THE HEADLIGHTS
SIDE MIRRORS GIVE GOOD VISIBILITY OF BLIND SPOT BUT YOU CAN T SEE A LOT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE AND TURN YOUR HEAD EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT THE DESIGN OF THE CAR IS BULKY ON THOSE REAR SIDES
VISIBILTY THROUGH TAILGATE WINDOW COULD BE IMPROVED
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS TO BE MOUNTED TOO LOW ON THE WINDSHIELD AND BLOCKS VISABILITY TO THE RIGHT
THE BAR BETWEEN THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW AND THE REAR WINDOW IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN PULLING OUT OF A STREET ON A 45 DEGREE ANGLE IT IS VERY HARD TO SEE
WITHOUT REAR CAMERA PHYSICAL VISIBILITY WOULD NOT BE ADEQUATE
SIDE MIRRORS COULD BE LARGER TO REDUCE BLIND SPOTS
I AM ABLE TO SET THE THREE REAR VIEW MIRROR TO COVER THREE LANES VERY SUCCESSFULLY I HAVE NOT COME TO A HIGH COMFORT LEVEL OF USING THE FISH EYE MIRROR SECTIONS ON THE TWO EXTERIOR MIRROR WOULD PREFER AN ELECTRONIC WARNING SYSTEM FOR BLIND SPOTS
THE EXTRA MIRROR ON THE SIDE MIRRORS ALLOWS ME TO SEE CARS THAT MAY BE IN MY BLIND SPOT WHEN SHIFTING LANES I HAVE GOTTEN USE TO THEM AND LIKE THEM ALOT
AFTER DRIVING THIS VEHICLE FOR 3 MONTHS NOW I DO SEE BLIND SPOTS HOWEVER OWNING 3 PRIOR TOYOTA S I NOTICE THIS IS A COMMON FACTOR
THIS IS MY SECOND VENZA I DRIVE IN THE CITY AND AM WELL USED TO THE PROBLEM BLIND SPOTS WITH THIS VEHICLE THE BACKUP CAMERA IS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FROM MY BUT THE CORRECTION ON THE SIDE MIRRORS US REALLY INADEQUATE IN THE SETTING OF TODA
BLIND SPOT MIRRORS POORLY PLACED SHOULD BE IN LOWER OUTSIDE CORNER NOT UPPER
HAVE BLIND SPOTS
REAR VISION WHEN CHANGING LANES IS HORRIBLE YOU JUST PLAIN CAN NOT SEE OTHER CARS BESIDE YOU OR NEAR YOU
I HAD TO REMOVE THE REAR HEAD SUPPORTS TO BETTER SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW NO ONE SITS IN MY BACK SEAT I WOULD LIKE AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS LIKE I HAD IN MY YARIS
DEFINITELY SMALL DIMENSIONS REDUCE COMFORT AND SAFETY FEELING  SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS
THERE IS A BAD BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE WHEN I TURN MY HEAD AROUND PRIOR TO CHANGING LANES TO THE LEFT AS A RESULT I VE HAD TO ADJUST THE DRIVER S SIDE SIDE VIEW MIRROR TO ELIMINATE THE BLIND SPOT WHICH IS OK JUST NOT IDEAL
OUTSTANDING VISIBILITY OF SURROUNDING FOR TWO DOORS
NASTY BLIND SPOT JUST BEHIND THE DRIVER S DOOR HAS CAUGHT ME BY SURPRISE A COUPLE OF TIMES AGAIN THOUGH I EXPECTED THAT
DO NOT PUT A BACK UP CAMERA ON THIS BABY ONLY SWISHY BOYS AND BITCHES NEED BACK UP CAMERAS
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS GREAT BECAUSE I CAN SEE EVERY LANE BEHIND ME WITHOUT OVERLY ADJUSTING IT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE USELESS TO ME I AM TO TALL TO SEE OUT OF THEM ALL I SEE IS THE SIDE OF THE CAR
WOULD LIKE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SIGNAL
I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO SEE WELL WHEN I M PASSING CHANGING LANES DUE TO THE CONSTRUCTION PANEL BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK WINDOW IT SEEMS WIDE THE BACK WIPER ONLY WIPES A SMALL AREA SO I HAVE LIMITED VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW THE FRONT WIP
I FIND THE VISIBILITY TOWARDS EITHER SIDE OF VEHICLE S BLIND SPOTS IS VERY DIFFICULT
PREVIOUSLY OWNED A VENZA BLINDSPOT MIRRORS ARE MUCH IMPROVED
I THINK THE VISIBILITY IS GREAT I FEEL VERY SAFE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE
DO TO LITTLE OR LEAST ROOM FOR BACK SEATS THE REAR HEAD RESTS AREN T USEFUL FOR NOTHING OTHER THAN DESIGN FASHION BECAUSE THEY OBSTRUCT THE REAR VIEW
HAS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING UP
I VE ADDED STICK ON WIDE ANGLE MIRROR ATTACHMENTS TO MY SIDE VIEW MIRRORS THE LEFT & RIGHT REAR CORNERS ARE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE OBJECTS CARS IN THOSE BLIND SPOTS
THE PROJECTOR BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT OVER PREVIOUS GENERATIONS AND DO WELL TO LIGHT THE VEHICLE TO THE FRONT THE VISIBILTY TO THE REAR SIDES IS STILL POOR ALTHOUGH IT HAS ALSO IMPROVED SLIGHTLY OVER PREVIOUS MODELS DRIVER S CO
BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT PERHAPS MAKE REAR SIDE WINDOWS SLIGHTLY LARGER
I AM A MASTER TECH IN THE AUTOMOTIVE FIELD AND BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE BASED ON A RENTAL I DROVE AND WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH AND TRADED MY HONDA ACCORD WHICH I AM A HONDA FAITHFUL DRIVER BUT WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE HONDA FIT THE ONLY PROBLEM I H
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT WHILE RESEARCHING VARIOUS VEHICLES PRIOR TO PURCHASING THE SCION THAT IT CAME WITH A FACTORY BACK UP CAMERA AND VEHICLE STATISTICS AS STANDARD FEATURES I WAS WRONG IT SEEMS
THERE IS A TERRIBLE BLIND SPOT IN THE RIGHT CORNER SOMEONE WAS TURNING LEFT AND ALMOST TBONED ME BECAUSE I COULDNT EVEN SEE THEM WHERE THE RIGHT CORNER WINDOW IS LOCATED
SUN VISORS ARE TOO SHORT BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES HOWEVER DO HAVE GREAT MIRRORS
BLIND SPOTS ARE A BIT TRICKY WITH THIS CAR
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS WHEN LEAVING A PARKING LOT OR DRIVEWAY ITS USUALLY WERE THE DOOR PARTITIONS ARE AND THE BACK PART OF THE CAR
DESPITE ALL THE MIRRORS AND ANGLES I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO JUDGE DISTANCE OF OTHER VEHICLES AND I DON T TRUST BACKING OUT WITH THE BACKUP CAMERA I THINK THERE ARE STILL BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING
I DONT BELIEVE I HAVE THE OPTION OF THE CAMERA AND WARNING SYSTEM I HAVE A CAMERA WHEN I BACK UP AND THAT IT THE ONLY TIME IT SHOWS UP I THINK THE OTHER OPTION WOULD BE LOVELY
THERE IS A HUGE BLIND SPOT IN THE BACK 40% OF THE CAR BUT I KNOW MOST SPORTS CARS ARE LIKE THAT SO IM NOT TOO BOTHERED BY IT AS LONG AS I PAY ATTENTION I KNOW ILL BE OK
VERY BIG BLIND SPOTS FROM THE SLANTING OF THE TRUNK HATCHBACK PART OF THE CAR
NEEDS A REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER AND HEATED SIDE MIRRORS
THE BACK SIDE WINDOWS ARE TOO SMALL ITS HARD TO SEE AND OBSTRUCT THE VIEW WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS IN THE SIDE MIRRORS
BAD BLIND SPOT
BAD BLIND SPOTS WHEN LOOKING BACK
THE SIDE VISIBILITY IS A BIT LACKING THE LITTLE QUARTER WINDOWS ARE OKAY BUT STILL LEAVE A DECENT BLIND SPOT
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING THAT ARE HARD TO GET USED TO
VISIBILITY TO THE 5 AND 7 O CLOCK DIRECTIONS IS LIMITED AS IT IS WITH MOST CARS THIS MAKE IT TOUGH ON CALIFORNIA FREEWAYS WITH MULTIPLE LANES TO SEE A CAR MOVING INTO THE LANE TO YOU RIGHT FOR EXAMPLE
THIS CAR HAS BIG BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES BUT I LIKE THE CAR IT S MY SECOND ONE AND I M USED TO IT I STILL WISH IT WAS BETTER
THE ONLY CRITICISM I HAVE REGARDING THE VEHICLE S VISIBILITY IS THAT IT CAN BE DIFFICULT AT TIMES TO VIEW THE VEHICLE S BLIND SPOTS PRIOR TO CROSSING LANES
VISIBILITY GREAT
EXCEPTIONAL HAS THE BEST VISIBILITY
OVERALL DRIVING SENSATION IS A FEELING OF SOLIDITY AND SAFETY
WE REMOVED THE REAR HEADRESTS FOR BETTER REARWARD VISIBILITY THEY CAN BE EASILY REPLACED WHEN WE CARRY ANYONE IN THE REAR SEAT WHICH IS VERY RARE
DON T LIKE A PILLAR SIZE TOO LARGE AND BLOCKS VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING
I LOVE MY EOS THE PLACEMENT OF THE REAR HEADRESTS BLOCKI REAR VISION THE BACKSEAT PLACEMENT BLOCKS OUT AN ENTIRE CAR SIZE AT THE RIGHT DISTANCE
NO BLIND SPOTS TO SPEAK OF
THE CAR S BEAUTIFUL EXTERIOR STYLING INHERENTLY MEANS THAT REARWARD VISIBILITY IS HINDERED
PART OF VISIBILITY PROBLEM IS THE FACT IT IS A CONVERTIBLE
WHEN CHECKING FOR BLIND SPOT VISIVILITY IS BLOCK BY REAR SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
WE DO NOT HAVE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTOR FEATURE BLIND SPOTS ARE ALWAYS TRICKY AND ALWAYS WILL BE
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY ON THE BACK PASSANGER SIDE
HUGE BLIND SPOTS IN THE BACK QUADRANT OF THE RAGTOP
REAR SEAT HEAD REST BLOCK REAR VIEW A GOOD BIT
VISIBILITY IS A LITTLE CHALLENGING
HUSBAND BOUGHT A OUTBACK AND I REALLY DO LIKE IT S SAFETY FEATURES IN THE SIDE MIRROR BLIND SPOT ALERTS REAR CAMERA FRONT CAMERA STOPPING FEATURE ETC WISH I HAD THESE MY BEETLE ALSO DID NOT COME WITH THE AUTOMATIC REAR VIEW MIRR
WOULD LIKE CONVEX MIRROR SPOTS ON REAR VIEW DRIVERS MIRROR
NEVER THOUGHT I D LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA BUT LOVE HOW I AM ABLE TO SEE AROUND LARGE VEHICLES WHEN IN A PARKING LOT
IT IS STILL A BIG PROBLEM THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS I CHECK MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE CHANGING LANES I KNOW TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS HOWEVER YOU DID ONCE AGAIN SAVE THE DAY ON THIS YEAR S MODEL BY INCLUDING THE REAR CAMERA THERE IS NO MORE GUESS WORK
THE HEADLIGHTS NEED TO BE TURNED ON MANUALLY WE HAVE FOUND OURSELVES DRIVING WITHOUT HEADLIGHTS ON AS ALL OF OUR PREVIOUS VEHICLES HAVE HAD AUTOMATIC HEADLIGHTS
BLIND SPOT MIRRORS WOULD BE A WELCOME ADDITION THEY ARE ONE OF THE ONLY THINGS I MISS ABOUT MY FORD FOCUS
DESIGN OF REAR VIEW MIRRORS SEEMS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR A WIDE VIEW
I WISH THE HID HEADLIGHT PACKAGE INCLUDED HEADLIGHT WASHERS THE LIGHTS ARE EASILY COVERED WITH ROAD SALT DURING THE WINTER MONTHS REDUCING THEIR EFFECTIVENESS
LOVE THE HEADLIGHT SYSTEM THAT LIGHTS UP THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WHEN TURNING
BIG BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
IF YOU COULD OFFER BACKUP CAMERA STANDARD LIKE HONDA THAT WOULD BE GREAT
GOOD AROUND VISIBILITY WHEN REVERSING DON T REALLY NEED A REAR CAMERA BLIND SPOT IS LESS OF AN ISSUE WHEN SWITCHING LANES OR PULLING OUT OF PARKING SPACE
THE CAR HAS SIDE BLIND SPOTS THAT THE SIDE MIRRORS DO NOT COVER
SMALL SIDE MIRRORS AND REAR VIEW MIRROR MAKE CHANGING LANES DIFFICULT
THE A PILLAR BLOCKS SOME VIEW BUT IT HOUSES A FENDER TWEETER AND IT IS AN A PILLAR AFTER ALL
OUT OF ALL THE VEHICLES I TEST DROVE VW AND OTHERS THE GOLF HAD THE ABSOLUTE BEST REAR VISIBILITY
WINDSHIELD WIPERS WORK WELL AND CLEAR THE CORRECT PARTS OF THE WINDSHIELD
GIVEN WHERE I SET MY SEATING POSITION THERE S A SLIGHT BLIND SPOT ON THE LEFT BETWEEN THE READ AND DRIVER SIDE MIRROR THIS IS MADE A LITTLE WORSE BECAUSE THE SIDE MIRROR COMES TO A POINT OTHER GTI OWNERS SAY THE SAME THING I SET THE MIRROR W
GOOD VISIBILITY ALL AROUND AND NO BLOCKING ITEMS FROM DRIVERS VISION
REAR VISIBILITY AT CORNERS SHOULD BE BETTER
I FEEL THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS ON BOTH SIDES OF CAR I ALSO HAVE A HAD TIME SEEING OUT THE BACK WINDOW
BLIND SPOTS WHEN TURNING HEAD AROUND TO CHECK FOR OTHER CARS IS SOMEWHAT OBSCURED
OK VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES IS NOT VERY GOOD AND TAKES A FEW LOOKS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE
NICE VISIBILITY
BIG BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SIDE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM WOULD LIKE WIDER VIEW AVAILABLE IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
BLIND SPOTS ARE BIG
BLIND SPOT WARNING SENSORS WOULD BE A REAL PLUS ALONG WITH PARKING SENSORS
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS MORE USEFUL THAN INITIALLY EXPECTED GIVEN THE LIMITED REAR VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW
I DO FIND AND FOUND THE SAME THING IN MY OLD 2003 GOLF THAT THE VERY LARGE SIDE BEAMS FLANKING THE FRONT WINDSHIELD LIMIT THE VISIBILITY OF PEDESTRIANS WHEN I AM AT AN INTERSECTION I HAVE TO CRANE MY NECK AROUND BOTH SIDES OF THIS BEAM BEFORE
1 WOULD BE NICE IF IT SHOWED THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT WITHIN DRIVER S EASY VIEW RATHER THAN A SMALL SYMBOL ON THE NAVIGATION SCREEN 2 WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE BLIND SPOT PROTECTION WARNING IN SIDE MIRRORS
REAR SEAT HEADREST LIMIT THE VIEW ONLY THE MIDDLE ONE IS LOW PROFILE I VE REMOVED THEM ALTOGETHER WILL INSTALL WHEN NEEDED SMALL SIDE MIRRORS WOULD USE A BACKUP CAMERA NOT INCLUDED IN S TRIM
LARGE BLIND SPOTS LARGER SIDE VIEW AND REAR VIEW MIRRORS MIGHT HELP
OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS POOR FIELD OF VIEW
THERE IS A PECULIAR BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING BACK TOWARD RIGHT REAR I MUST DOUBLE CHECK VERY CAREFULLY WHEN TURNING LEFT FROM A STOP THAT NO CAR IS IN THIS BLIND SPOT
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO VIEW VEHICLES COMING ALONG SIDE OF ME
I WISH THERE WAS A WARNING SYSTEM FOR BLIND SPOT COVERAGE
LOVE THE DUAL SUN VISORS
THE BLIND SPOT ALERT FEATURE IS AN OUTSTANDING FEATURE I THINK IT SHOULD BE STANDARD ON EVERY VEHICLE
THE REAR CAMERA IS A VERY NICE TOOL
PERIPHERAL VISION SEEMS TO BE SOMEWHAT COMPROMISED BLIS IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AS COMPENSATION
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS WITH THE HEADREST AND SIDE PANELS
GOOD VISIBILITY OUT REAR WINDOWS WHICH IS HELPFUL
THE TINTED WINDOWS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE THAT IS HAPPENING AROUND YOU
THE HEAD RESTS BLOCK SOME VISIBILITY PARTICULARLY WHEN EASING INTO TRAFFIC
THERE SEEMS TO BE A LARGER THEN USUAL BLIND SPOT ON EITHER SIDE
ABSOLUTELY LOVE ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURES ESPECIALLY BLIND SPOT MONITORING
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AND FEEL SAFE WHEN DRIVING IN BUSY TRAFFIC FOR CHANGING LANES
BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS AN EXCELLENT SAFETY TOOL
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT AUTO LIGHTS
REAR CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD THE PASSENGER WIPER BLADE IS ANNOYING BECAUSE IT DOESN T GO DOWN ALL THE WAY
IT MAY BE JUST THAT I AM SMALL AND THE CAR FEELS BIG FOR ME I DO FEEL THERE IS A BLIND SPOT THAT I HAVE TO BE AWARE OF WHEN TURNING AROUND OR SWITCHING LANES BUT THE SIDE MIRRORS AND THE WARNING SIGNALS ARE EXTREMELY HELPFUL
IT S DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOWS I M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE BACK UP CAMERA I WOULD FEEL VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE
OUTSTANDING ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL COLLISION AVOIDANCE AND BLIND SPOT   CROSS TRAFFIC ALERT PERFORMANCE
WE LOVE THE REPUTATION OF VOLVO IN SAFETY STANDARDS
TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE EXCELLENT
VERY CLEAR VIEW WITH ASSIST FROM THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR LIGHTING GIVES YOU ASSURANCE WHILE DRIVING IN TRAFFIC
IT S BUILT FOR SAFETY
THE WIPERS DON T SEEM TO BE AS GOOD AS OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE HAD THEY DON T REACH A BROAD ENOUGH AREA AND THEY LEAVE SMALL STREAKS ON THE OTHER HAND I LOVE THE BLISS SYSTEM JUST DROVE BACK FROM FLORIDA TO MASSACHUSETTS WITH MY HUSBAND AND I WA
LOVE THE HEADLIGHTS THEY MOVE WITH THE CAR WHEN I M TURNING I ALSO LOVE THE BLIS SYSTEM EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS CAR SCREAMS SAFETY
NEEDS BRIGHTER HEADLIGHTS
THE FRONT WINDOW IS VERY LARGE AND GREAT FOR VISIBILITY BUT THE SUN VISOR IS SMALLL AND I AM SHORT SO IT IS USELESS IN BLOCKING THE SUN VISOR NEEDS TO BE LARGER NOT WIDER BUT LONGER
BLIND SPOT AND WINDSHIELD WIPERS SMUGGING HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE
BLIS AND PARK ASSIST CTA ARE GREAT FEATURES TO HAVE I WISH IT CAME WITH REAR CAMERA AND VOLVO SAYS IT CAN T BE PUT ON AS AN OPTION FOR MY 5 CAR
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS FEEL A BIT FLIMSY
THE HEADLIGHTS IS REALLY NOTICEABLY JUST AVERAGE COMPARED TO OTHER CARS I HAVE DRIVEN BMW S HAVE ZENON LIGHTS THAT REALLY LIGHT UP THE ROAD SO WELL THE HEADLIGHTS ARE JUST ORDINARY AND JUST LIGHTS A SHORT WAY IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE AND I CAN T
I DON T REALLY LIKE THE PART ON THE HOOD THAT STICKS UP IT MAKES THE VISIBILITY WHILE PARKING A BIT DIFFICULT
IT SEEMS TO HAVE A FAIRLY LARGE BLIND SPOT ON THE VEHICLE
THE REAR VIEW IS SEVERELY LIMITED WITH THE REAR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM DOWN
I LOVE MY RAV4 HOWEVER WHEN SWITCHING LANES I DON T FEEL AS CONFIDENT WITH THE REAR VISIBILITY AS I DID WITH MY BMWX5 THOSE APPENDAGES ATTACHED TO THE REAR SEATS FOR PASSENGERS SEEM TO GET IN THE WAY
THE VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS HINDERED THE WINDOW AREA COULD BE LARGER AND THE HEADRESTS INTERFERE WITH SIGHT THE OVERHEAD REAR WINDOW WIPER DOES NOT CLEAR ENOUGH AREA THE UNDER THE WINDOW MOUNTED WIPER CLEARS A LARGER AREA
ALWAYS FEEL SAFE GETTING INTO THE TACOMA BEING UP AS HIGH AS IT IS MAKES FOR GREAT VISIBILITY DURING ALL CONDITIONS
THE NEW HEADLIGHTS ARE GREAT THEY GIVE A WIDE RANGE AND A GOOD DISTANCE OF VISIBILITY I FEEL LIKE I COULD SEE A PEDESTRIAN OR DOG ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD MUCH BETTER IN THE
LACK OF VISIBILITY WHEN ENTER HIGHWAY BECAUSE OF THE EXTEND OF ROOF SUPPORT WITH SMALL WINDOW WHEN LOOKING LEFT FROM THE DRIVERSSIDE AND RIGHT FROM THE DRIVERS SIDE
FRONT VISIBILITY IS REALLY BAD BECAUSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHERE THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK IS BECAUSE THE HOOD ELEVATION IS HIGH I AM THINKING ABOUT GLUING A SMALL FLAG TO THE FRONT GRILL OF THE TRUCK THAT STICKS UP ABOVE THE HOOD I HAVE NO I
REAR VIEW MIRROR DOES REDUCE DRIVERS VISIBILTY
THE TURN SIGNAL INDICATOR LIGHTS IN THE DASH ARE REALLY HARD TO SEE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HEADLIGHTS ARE ON THERE IS A HEADLIGHT INDICATOR LIGHT THAT IS JUST BELOW THE LEFT SIGNAL INDICATOR THAT IS THE SAME COLOR AND IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT LIGHT A
REAR VISIBILITY IS TYPICALLY POOR SINCE IT IS A PICK UP TRUCK FRONT VISIBILITY TO THE FRONT QUARTER PANELS IS SEVERELY HAMPERED BY THE FRONT DOOR PILLARS WHICH ARE EXTRA THICK PROBABLY TO ACCOMODATE AIR BAGS
IT IS INCREDIBLY HARD TO SEE OUTSIDE THE DRIVER SIDE REAR WINDOW TO SEE MY BLIND SPOT DUE TO THE SIZE SHAPE OF THE DRIVER SEAT & THE LOCATION OF THE BEAM BETWEEN THE FRONT & REAR DOORS
BLIND SPOT IS REALLY BAD
SURPRISINGLY GREAT ALL AROUND VISIBILITY FOR A CREW MAX VEHICLE VISORS A BIT TOO SMALL BUT NICE EXTENDERS
THE FRONT QUARTER PANELS HAVE A BLIND SPOT
CAN T FIGURE OUT OF THERE IS AND AUTOMATIC SETTING FOR THE HEADLIGHTS
REAR VIEW BACK UP CAMERA IS A MAJOR ASSET I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BACK UP TURNING GRAPHIC THAT IS STEERING ACTIVATED WHILE BACKING IE SEVERAL OTHERS VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS
LARGE VEHICLE WITH VERY FEW BLIND SPOTS
REAR VISIBILITY AND RIGHT LANE VISIBILITY IS POOR I TAKE OFF THE HEADREST ON THE RIGHT REAR PASSENGER SEAT FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
BIG BLIND SPOT AT DOOR PILLARS 
WHEN SOFT TOP IS UP THE BLIND SPOT IS LARGE
THIS MODEL JAG HAS BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY CARS NEXT TO YOU I AM USE TO IT AS I OWNED THE SAME MODEL PREVIOUSLY
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT OUT THE BACK WINDOW DUE TO THE HATCHBACK LID WISH THERE WAS A DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR CAMERA JUST LIKE THE ONE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE MIRROR
AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS DO NOT WARN DRIVER QUICKLY OF VEHICLES TO THE LEFT OF RIGHT
ONE OR THE REASONS THAT I PURCHASED BOTH MY LR2 AND LR4 IS THE ABILITY TO SEE OUT OF ALL THE WINDOWS NO BLIND SPOTS
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY THE LARGE WINDOWS ALL AROUND MEAN THERE ESSENTIALLY ZERO BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM EXCEPTIONAL
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE CAMERA ON THE DRIVERS SIDE EXTERIOR MIRROR LIKE THERE IS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE I REALLY LIKE SEEING THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE CAR WHEN NEED BE WHY CANT YOU MAKE BOTH SIDE MIRRORS GO DOWN AT THE SAME TIME
EXCELLENT HEADLIGHT LIGHTING
THE SUN VISOR ON DRIVER S SIDE CANNOT BE MOVED FROM FRONT TO SIDE WITHOUT MOVING THE SEAT BACKWARDS OTHERWISE THE VISOR CONNECTS WITH THE HEADREST MAKING THE VISOR STICK HALFWAY BETWEEN THE FRONT AND SIDE REAR VISIBILITY IS BETTER THAN IN TH
PERPETUAL BLIND SPOT
AS MENTIONED EARLIER BOTH OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SHOW THE OUTLINE OF SILVER AIR VENT DECORATION FROM INSIDE VEHICLE CAUSING LACK OF VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES DEALER SUGGESTED I PUT BLACK TAPE OVER THE SILVER VENT OUTLINES AFTER SPENDIN
THE PILLAR BETWEEN THE REAR PASSENGER DOOR AND HATCH IS QUITE A BLIND SPOT
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR WHEN MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN GOT TO LOOK WITH YOUR EYES TO MAKE SURE THERE IS NOTHING THERE
NEXT TIME LOWER FRONT HOOD FOR BETTER DRIVER VISIBILITY
PUT A SIDE SUN VISOR ON THE VEHICLE PLEASE OTHER THAN THAT THIS VEHICLE IS EASY TO SEE FROM AND RANKS AMONG THE BEST I VE DRIVEN INCLUDING THE INFINTI BTW
I WISH NISSAN WOULD NOT HAVE ELIMINATED THE RAIN SENSING WIPERS
THE DESIGN OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WASHERS CAUSES WATER FROM THE DRIVERS SIDE TO BE THROWN ON THE PASSENGER SIDE AFTER THE PASSENGER S WIPER BLADE HAS ALREADY COMPLETED A WIPE THIS LEAVES A LOT OF WATER IN THE PASSENGER S VIEW
THIS TRUCK HAS GREAT VISIBILITY ON ALL SIDES
SO MANY BLIND SPOTS WE FREQUENTLY COMMENT ON HOW NECESSARY THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM IS
THE BACKSEAT MIDDLE SEAT BELT IS DIRECTLY IN THE LINE OF VISION THROUGH THE REAR VIEW I AM OK WITH IT NOW AS I HAVE GROWN USED TO IT BUT IT IS A DISTRACTION WHEN FIRST DRIVING
SOMETHING HAPPENS WHEN DRIVING AT NIGHT ON LOW BEAM THERE IS A DISTINCT DARK LINE AREA THAT APPEARS ACROSS THE WHOLE WINDSHIELD AND VISIBILITY IS EXTREMELY LIMITED IT S ALMOST LIKE THERE IS A DARK WINDOW TINT ON THE TOP 3 4 S OF THE WINDSHIELD
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DON T REMOVE ALL OF THE WATER FROM THE WINDSHIELD
HARD TO SEE OUT SIDE BACK WHEN TURN HEAD TO CHANGE LANES FINDING I AM RELYING ON THE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM AT ALL TIMES
HIGH UP AND VISIBILITY IS EASY
I LIKE THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS
WE DO NOT HAVE THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS I WISH WE DID ALSO THE VEHICLE HAS A VERY LARGE BLIND SPOT IT WOULD BE NICE IF INFINITI OFFERED ELEMENTS OF THE SAFETY PACKAGE RATHER THAN ALL OR NOTHING
WIFE IS SHORT AND HAS A PROBLEM SEEING OVER HER RT SHOULDER WHEN CHANGING LANES BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES IS DIFFICULT I RELY ON THE WARNING SYSTEM
MY MAJOR COMPLAINT AROUND VISIBILITY IS THE NARROW VIEW IN REAR VIEW MIRROR OUT BACK WINDOW HEADRESTS IMPEDED A BIT AND JUST THE SHEER SMALLNESS OF THE REAR WINDOW CONTRIBUTE TO THE SMALLNESS OF VIEW NOT THRILLED WITH THE VIEW THE DRIVER HAS LOO
THERE IS A PROMINENT BLIND SPOT WHEN BACKING BETWEEN THE UPPER PART OF THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE REAR BUMPER YOU CANNOT SEE THIS WITH NEITHER THE SIDE MIRROR OR INTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROR
I LOVE THE DRIVER CONTROL ASSIST FEATURE AND THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION FEATURES THE SAFETY FEATURES ON THIS VEHICLE ARE PROBABLY MY OVERALL FAVORITE FEATURES
SIDE MIRRORS MAKE BLIND SPOTS BACK PANELS MAKE HUGE BLIND SPOTS
OVERALL GREAT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE REAR WING OBSTRUCTS REAR VISIBILITY
SMALL BLIND SPOT TO LEFT AND SLIGHTLY BEHIND OF DRIVER IT IS MADE WORSE WHEN SUIT JACKET IS HUNG ON THE HOOK FOR COATS BUT LOVE THE CONVENIENCE OF THE HOOK
THE ONLY COMMENT IS THAT THE VISORS WHEN MOVED TO THE SIDE POSITION DO NOT HAVE FRONT TO REAR ADJUSTABILITY THIS COULD BE A RESULT OF THE SMALL SIZE OF THIS CAR VISIBILITY ALL AROUND IS AIDED BY THE LACK OF A REAR QUARTER BLINDSPOT AS A RESULT
REAR GLASS GETS IMMEDIATELY DAMP AND VISIBILITY DROPS MARKEDLY DURING RAINING IT REQUIRE CONTINUOUS FAST MOTION WIPER ACTIONS TO KEEP CENTER PORTION CLEAN SO DRIVER CAN SEE WHAT BEHIND THE VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING
SURPRISINGLY GOOD 360 VISIBILITY IT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO HAVE TURN SIGNAL INDICATORS EMBEDDED IN THE SIDE MIRRORS
BETTER VISIBILITY IN ALL THREE MIRRORS WOULD BE DESIRABLE ALTHOUGH NOW THAT I M USED TO THEM THEY RE NOT AS BAD AS I FIRST THOUGHT THEIR FAIRLY TIGHT FIELDS OF VIEW MAKES THEM SEEM QUITE CLAUSTROPHOBIC AT FIRST BUT THEY DON T ACTUALLY MISS VERY
THE WING BISECTS THE REAR VISION AND THE LOWERED AIR SPLITTER UP FRONT MAKES THIS CAR A PRIME CANDIDATE FOR FRONT REAR CAMERAS
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BETTER VISIBILITY THE POST DIRECTLY TO THE LEFT OF THE DRIVER S HEAD CAN EASILY BLOCK AN ANGLED ROADWAY INTERSECTING WITH YOUR PATH
THE ONLY NEGATIVE TO THIS CAR IS A VISIBILITY ISSUE WHEN BACKING OUT IT IS A CONVERTIBLE AND HAS A BLIND SPOT DO TO THE CONVERTIBLE TOP MY HARD TOP CARRERA 4 DOES NOT HAVE THIS ISSUE PORSCHE HAS GIVEN ME ALL OF THE TOOLS TO CIRCUMVENT THIS I
REAR WING OBSTRUCTS REAR VISION IT SHOULD BE HIGHER
WITH THE TOP DOWN VISIBILITY IMPROVES TOP UP FORCES YOU TO BE A BETTER DRIVER SOMETHING THAT IS MISSING IN THE WAY MANY DRIVE TODAY
LACK OF COLLISION AVOIDANCE AND BACKUP CAMERA ARE MAJOR SAFETY ISSUES
WITH THE REAR WING THIS CAR NEEDS A BACK UP CAMERA
WITH THE LARGE WING BLOCKING REAR VISIBILITY A BACK UP OR REAR VISION CAMERA OPTION SHOULD BE OFFERED ON THIS MODEL
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SEEM VERY LARGE SOMETIMES FEEL LIKE THEY OBSTRUCT MY SIGHT LINE
CHANGING LANES TO RIGHT CAN E DIFFICULT DUE TO BLIND SPOTS BODY PARTS INADEQUATE RIGHT SIDE MIRROR
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS A JOKE THE SHAPE IS TOO ODD TO BE USEFUL
REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TO SMALL AND HARD TO SEE IN BACK OF YOU
LARGER REAR VIEW MIRROR WOULD ALLOW FOR BETTER VISIBILITY
MIDDLE HEADREST IN BACK BLOCKS VISIBILITY
ELECTRONIC COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS AND BACKUP CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD NOT $3 5K OPTIONS EACH BMW AUDI ETC OFFER AS STANDARD
THIS IS A GT 3 AND THE REAR WING CREATES VISIBILITY ISSUES NEEDED A REAR CAMERA
THE CAR HAD GREAT LARGE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS WITH GREAT VISIBILITY FROM WITHIN THE CAR
VISIBILITY IS GREAT IN THIS SMALL CAR IT ACTUALLY BETTER COMPARED TO MY OTHER VEHICLE WHICH I WILL NOT NAME BUT OTHER VEHICLE IS A CROSS OVER SO YOU WOULD THINK IT WOULD HAVE BETTER VISIBILITY COMPARED TO THE PORSCHE CAYMAN BUT IT DOES NOT
FRONT WIPERS WASHERS COULD BE IMPROVED IN MY OPINION THE WASHER SPRAYERS ARE NOT OPTIMAL THEY PROVIDE MORE A STREAM THAN A SPRAY AND THE WIPERS COULD BE BETTER SUN VISORS COULD BE A LITTLE BIGGER AND INCLUDE LIGHT AND SIDE EXTENSIONS
SOME BLIND SPOTS OUT TO THE REAR LEFT RIGHT
VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY ARE MORE ABOUT THE DRIVER THAN THE CAR
REAR VISIBILITY IS LIMITED
GIVEN THE POOR REAR AND SIDE VISIBILITY FROM INSIDE THE CAR BACK UP CAMERA PARKING SENSORS AND LANE CHANGE ASSIST SHOULD BE STANDARD FEATURES PORSCHE INSTEAD OFFERS THESE FEATURES AS OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES AS A RESULT A POTENTIAL BUYER CAN FIND
VISIBILITY TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT E G AT AN INTERSECTION IS NOT GREAT
REAR VIEW MIRROR AND REAR WINDOW A LITTLE SMALL VISORS DO NOT HAVE HORIZONTAL ADJUSTMENT TO BLOCK THE SUN WHEN THE SUN IS AT OTHER THAN 90 DEGREE ANGLE FROM MY POINT OF VIEW
WITH THE TOP DOWN ALL VISABILITY ISSUES ARE GONE
MINOR BLIND SPOTS TO THE REAR QUARTERS BUT NO WORSE THAN OTHER CARS I VE OWNED
SMALL REAR WINDOWS MAKE BLIND SPOTS LARGER THAN NORMAL
VISIBILITY TOWARD THE REAR OF THE CAR COULD BE IMPROVED
FRONT AND REAR CAMERA WOULD BE A WELCOME ADDITION
I USUALLY DRIVE WITH THE TOP DOWN SO VISIBILITY IS NOT A PROBLEM AT ALL
VISIBILITY OUT OF FRONT IS EXCELLENT BACK A FIN BLOCKS THE VIEW A BIT AND THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS LOOKING OUT THE SIDE WINDOWS
IT NEEDS HEADS UP DISPLAY HUD TO INCREASE DRIVING SAFETY THE OVERALL VISIBILITY IS SUPERB BUT DRIVING WOULD BE BETTER SAFER IF ONE DIDN T HAVE TO GLANCE DOWN TO CHECK THE SPEED
WHEN THE TOP IS DOWN THERE ARE NO VISIBILITY PROBLEMS IN ANY DIRECTION OBVIOUSLY
AGAIN I CANNOT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE VISIBILITY I KNEW WHAT I WAS BUYING
SIDE VISIBILITY A PROBLEM WITH NO HELP FROM SYSTEMS
REAR VISIBILITY IS A BIT POOR AND WOULD BE A PROBLEM WITHOUT THE REAR CAMERA
WING COMPROMISES REAR VISIBILITY SHOULD HAVE STANDARD REAR VIEW CAMERA
WOULD LIKE A BEEFIER WIPER BLADE
NO BLIND SPOT
WHILE IT HAS SOME BLIND SPOTS SO DOES EVERY CAR BUT THE LANE CHANGE ASSIST WORKS PERFECTLY EXCEPT I DON T UNDERSTAND WHY IT DOESN T WORK BELOW 20 MPH IT SHOULD WORK REGARDLESS OF SPEED REAR HEADRESTS IN OUTBOARD POSITIONS ARE LARGER THAN MI
BLIND SPOT ON LEFT WHEN OVERTAKING
I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE PARKING SENSORS AND REAR VIEW CAMERA NEXT TIME
HEADLIGHT ILLUMINATION IS BEST EVER
BLIND SPOT BECAUSE OF CONVERTIBLE TOP IS THE ONLY DISABILITY PROBLEM
VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD EASY AS MY LAST CAR THE HONDA ODYSSEY I WAS SEATED HIGHER IN THE ODYSSEY
REAR VISIBILITY VIA THE REAR GLASS COULD BE BETTER BUT THE REAR VIEW CAM IS AMAZING
LOVE THE REAR WIPERS
LOVE JEWEL HEADLIGHT LITTLE LACK OF VISABILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES
I LOVE THE CRUISE ASSIST AND LANE DEPARTURE WARNING AND HEADS UP DISPLAY AND ANTI COLLISION BRAKING AND PARKING SENSORS AND BACKUP CAMERA BOTH DAY AND NIGHT AND AUTO DIM MIRRORS AND
REAR WINDOW IS TOO SMALL I CURRENTLY OWN A 99 TL 94 TSX AND A 95 MDX VISIBILITY IN THE TSX IS MY FAVORITE CANNOT GET COMFORTABLE USING THE REAR CAMERA I FEEL IT IS MISLEADING ON DISTANCE PROBABLY JUST SOMETHING YOU NEED TO GET USED
POOR QUALITY HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE XENON OR OTHER HIGH DEFINITION
THE SIDE VISIBILITY IS RESTRICTED
I USE A LARGER REAR MIRROR VERSUS THE ONE GIVEN SO I CAN SEE BETTER FOR REAR VISIBILITY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE REAR VISIBILITY WHEN THE BACK HEAD RESTS ARE UP IT TAKES UP REAR VISIBILITY
I WISH THAT THE RDX HAD AS MUCH REAR VISIBILITY AS MY PREVIOUS LEXUS RX 300 DID
IT HAS THE BEST VISIBILITY OF ANY CAR I HAVE OWNED
THE REARVIEW CAMERA COULD A LITTLE BETTER IN COLOR CLARITY AND COULD USE CROSS TRAFFIC IN REAR BACKING
IT WOULD BE NICE IF HEADS UP DISPLAY AND AWD WAS AVAILABLE AS AN OPTION ON ALL MODELS NOT JUST THE HYBRID
I LOVE THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR IT HAS A BLIND SPOT AVOIDANCE AREA WHICH WORKS BEAUTIFULLY IT IS SUCH A GREAT FEATURE
WOULD LIKE MORE SAFETY FEATURES BLIND SPOT LANE DEPARTURE ETC
WISH YOU HAD A CAMERA DISPLAY LIKE IN THE HONDA TO SHOW BLIND SPOT AREA INSTEAD OF JUST THE LIGHT AND SOUND INDICATION THERE S A PROBLEM WITH THE DRIVER S SIDE VENT REFLECTING IN THE WINDOW RIGHT WHERE YOU LOOK AT THE DRIVERS SIDE OUTSIDE MIRROR
I EXPECT TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER S SEAT JUST NEED TO ADJUST TO THIS NEW VEHICLE
NAVIGATION MAP IS HARD TO SEE READ WITH POLARIZED SUN GLASSES
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS NEED TO RESULT IN MORE VISIBILITY
I REALLY WISH THIS CAR HAD A BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM THE SLIVER OF BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR IS COMEPLETELY USELESS IT ACTUALLY GETS IN THE WAY OF SEEING CARS
THE TINTED REAR WINDOW MAKES IT A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE AT NIGHT
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS IN THE XC70 BUT WITH CAUTION ARE MANAIGABLE
HIGH ALL AROUND VISIBILITY WAS A KEY FACTOR IN BUYING
REAR VIEW IS EXCELLENT
VOLVO S NEED THE BLIS FEATURE THERE ARE NOTICEABLE BLIND SPOTS LIKE MOST VEHICLES I FIND THAT WITH ANY NEW VEHICLE I GET OR WOULD GET I NEED BLIS
DRIVER S BLIND SPOT COULD BE IMPROVED I DON T HAVE BLIS ALL VOLVO HEADLIGHTS SEEMS DIM COMPARED TO OTHER VEHICLE MODELS
THE REAR VISIBILITY IS DIFFICULT FROM THE DRIVER SEAT WHEN THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS ARE UP YOU HAVE TO PUT THEM DOWN TO SEE WELL
THE XENON HEADLIGHTS ARE TRULY MARVELOUS AND THE REAR LIGHTING IS EXCEPTIONAL
I LIKE THE BLIS AND REAR CAMERA MORE THAN I EXPECTED AND HAVE COME TO RELY ON IT
LIKE THE REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER
I LIKE THE HEADLIGHTS AND THE BLS SYSTEM I THINK THESE FEATURES INCREASE MY SAFETY
WISH THIS VEHICLE HAD BLIND SPOT DETECTION BUT THAT S NOT NECESSARILY VOLVO S PROBLEM SINCE IT IS AVAILABLE ON OTHER MODELS BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY MODEL AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME AT THE DEALER
SURE DO LIKE THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE AND LANE DEPARTURE AND BLIND SPOT WARNING AND AUTO BRAKE SYSTEMS
THE VISIBILITY IS THE BEST I VE EVER EXPERIENCED IN A VEHICLE
REAR VISIBILITY IS NOT AS GOOD AS MY LAST CAR WHICH WAS A SUBARU OUTBACK
SAFEST CAR I HAVE EVER DRIVEN ELECTRONIC SAFETY TECH SOMETIMES GETS A BIT ANNOYING BUT HAS ITS PLACE WITH INEXPERIENCED DRIVES
EVERY ANGLE OF VIEW IS REPRESENTED CLEARLY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT BLIND SPOTS ARE EXTREMELY SMALL
I LOVE THE BLIS
MIRRORS NEED A CONVEX PORTION TO SEE IN THE BLIND SPOT ALMOST ALL CARS HAVE THIS PROBLEM AND IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED BY ALL THE CAR MANUFACTURES IT WOULD BE NICE THAT VOLVO RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM AND INSTITUTE A DUAL MIRROR TO SEE THE FULL
VISIBILITY THE VECHICLES HAS SEVERAL BLIND STOPS HOWEVER THE SENSORS THAT DETECT VECHICLES ON THE SIDE ARE WONDERS
WIFE 4 11 LADY COMPLAINS THAT A POSTS BLOCK HER VISABILITY ON OCCASION
VEHICLE VISIBILITY IN ALL CONDITIONS IS ACCEPTABLE
IF NOT FOR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IT IS HARD TO JUDGE THE REAR END OF THE CAR AS YOU CANNOT SEE IT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK
BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM HELPS WITH LANE CHANGING ON PASSENGER SIDE
THANK GOODNESS FOR THE MIRROR WARNING SYSTEMS BECAUSE THERE IS A LARGE BAD BLIND SPOT ON BOTH SIDES WITHOUT THE WARNING SYSTEM I WOULD HAVE REAL DIFFICULTY CHANGING LANES EASILY
EXCELLENT BACKUP CAMERA VIEW IS CLEAR EVEN IN RAIN I VE OWNED OTHER CARS WHERE THE CAMERA WOULD BECOME BLURRY IN RAIN
GREAT WARNING SYSTEM OF OTHER CARS NEAR
CAN SEE WELL SITTING UP SO HIGH LOVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING ON THE MIRRORS
WINDSHIELD WIPERS VERY NOISY
VEHICLE HAS A BLIND SPOT AT REAR PASSENGER SIDE
REAR VISIBILITY LIMITED AT TIMES
NO BLIND SPOTS
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR WITH THE TOP UP IT IS REALLY REALLY BAD PERHAPS SLIGHTLY LARGER MIRRORS AND OR A FISHEYE RIGHT MIRROR WOULD HELP
I DRIVE 95% OF THE TIME WITH THE TOP DOWN THEREFORE THE VISIBILITY IS QUITE GOOD
IT S A CONVERTIBLE SO VISIBILITY IS AND WAS EXPECTED TO BE SOMEWHAT LESS THAN A HARDTOP SEDAN
AFTER DRIVING MY WIFE S LEXUS WITH BLIND SPOT MONITORING WHICH IS BRIGHT LOCATED ON THE MIRROR ITSELF AND WORKS TO 0 MPH I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE BMW SYSTEM THE INDICATOR LIGHT IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH THE SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK BELOW 20 30
I LOVE THE LANE CHANGE WARNING
BECAUSE I AM SHORT I FEEL THE SIZE OF THE CAR AND THE SEAT ADJUSTMENTS GIVE ME GOOD VISIBILITY
SUPERIOR VEHICLE S VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY
I DON T RELY ON THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING 100% AS I DON T THINK IT LIGHTS UP CORRECTLY ALL THE TIME WHEN A CAR IS IN THE BLIND SPOT I LIKE THE FEATURE AND IT S HELPFUL BUT YOU CAN T RELY ON IT 100%
STYLING COMPROMISES THE REARWARD VISIBILITY UNDERSTAND THAT AND CAN LIVE WITH THAT OVERALL VISIBILITY IS GREAT SIDE VIEW MIRRORS PROVIDE SURPRISINGLY GOOD REARWARD VIEW LIKE THE RECTANGULAR SHAPE
PRIVACY TINT UNDULY INTERFERES WITH REAR VISION
LOVE THE SIDE WARNING INDICATORS IN THE WING MIRRORS
HEADLIGHTS ARE PHENOMENAL WITH THE XENON OPTION DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS ARE NOT ONLY HIGHLY EFFECTIVE BUT ALSO INCREDIBLY STYLISH
VISIBILITY BETTER THAN THE LEXUS RC 350
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT IGHTS
LOVE THE HEAD UP DISPLAY AND THE TOP VIEW CAMERAS
WASHER FLUID DISPENSER COULD USE DIFFERENT NOZZLES THAT PROVIDE MORE COVERAGE WHEN SPRAYING ADDITION OF REAR WIPER WOULD BE NICE BACKUP CAMERA COULD BE A BETTER QUALITY
LOVE THE SIDE ASSIST WARNING LIGHTS WARNING OF ANOTHER VEHICLE IN YOUR BLINDSPOT
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT ASSIST EVEN THOUGH I DIDN T THINK I WOULD
ON SAFETY I FEEL VERY MUCH IN CONTROL TO AVOID ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF EXCELLENT VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW IS JUST OK
WINDSHIELD WIPER IS NOT EFFECTIVE ENOUGH IN CLEARING WATER AS OTHER VEHEICLES I HAVE OPERATED
MAIN CONCERN IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE VEHICLE HAS SIDE ASSIST SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE IS OF CONCERN
I LIKE THE LARGE COLUMN BETWEEN THE FRONT AND BACK WINDOWS BUT I NOW KNOW IT IS A BLIND SPOT FOR ME
I LIKE THE BLIND SPOT ALERT
BLIND SPOTS WHEN PARKING COULD BE BETTER BUT IS MORE THAN COMPENSATED FOR BY PARKING CAMERA AND OTHER SENSORS AND WARNINGS
I LOVE THE SIDE WARNING IF THERE IS A CAR NEXT TO ME
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT WHEN I LOOK TO THE RIGHT WHEN I DO NOT HAVE A PASSENGER IN TEH CAR I RECLINE THE PASSENGER SEAT TO OPEN THE VIEW PAST THE SEAT BACK TO THE REAR WINDOW WITH A PASSENGER IN THE FRONT THE COMBINATION OF THE B PILLA
OUTSIDE MIRRORS SHOULD COME WITH EXTRA WIDE MIRROR INSERT FOR BETTER VISIBILITY WHILE CHANGING LINES
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE QUITE LARGE AND DIFFICULT TO SEE AROUND WHEN DRIVING THEY CREATE BLIND SPOTS WHEN TURNING AND LOOKING LEFT RIGHT
VISIBILITY IS POOR WHEN TURNING LEFT AT A LIGHT STOP SIGN THE SUPPORT BAR BETWEEN PASSENGER AND REAR SEATS BLOCKS VISIBILITY FORCING ME TO LEAN FORWARD TO SEE TRAFFIC COMING FROM RIGHT
I CAN SEE SURROUNDING TRAFFIC THE AUTOMATIC BLIND SPOT DETECTION IS EXEMPLARY AND I FEEL INCREDIBLY SAFE IN DAILY TRAFFIC WITH OTHER DRIVERS WHO ARE NEVER PAYING ATTENTION TEXTING ETC
SIDE MIRRORS ARE PRETTY LARGE AND CREATE A BLIND SPOT IN ITSELF WHEN TURNING LEFT
FRONT MORROW TO BIG WHICH CAN BLOCK VISIBILITY SOMETIME
OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS CREATE BLIND SPOTS WHEN TURNING
THE VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT THE CAR FEELS VERY OPEN AND SPACIOUS THE PANORAMIC SUNROOF IS A NICE PLUS TO THIS
I THINK REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL MY OLD LEXUS WAS MUCH BETTER AND BIGGER
WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT GET THE MIDDLE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND THE STREAM OF THE CLEANER IS TOO NARROW
FRONT WIPERS WEREN T VERY EFFECTIVE IN A SNOW STORM ICE AND BUILD UP FORMED ON WIPER WHICH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND REDUCED VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOTS EXIST I DON T KNOW HOW YOU GET AROUND THAT THIS CAR IS NO BETTER NOR NO WORSE THAN ANY CAR I VE HAD IN THE PAST
CENTER REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL
THERE NEEDS TO BE A A LITTLE VISOR TO BLOCK THE SUN BETWEEN REAR VIEW MIRROR AND TOP OF ROOF
EXTREMELY SMALL REAR VIEW MIRROR
IT IS HARD MOST TIMES TO SEE VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES THERE SEEMS TO BE A BIG BLIND SPOT I HAVE TO PHYSICALLY TURN AND LOOK BEHIND MOST TIMES
THE CENTER REAR VIEW MIRROR ISN T BIG ENOUGH
I WISH I COULD GET RID OF THE HUMPY REAR CENTER HEADREST WHICH IMPINGES ON REAR VIEW MIRROR USEFULNESS
I FEEL EXTREMELY SAFE DRIVING THE VEHICLE EXCEPT WHEN IT COMES TO CHANGING LANES CONSIDERING MY HEIGHT AND THE DISTANCE BACK AT WHICH THE DRIVER S SEAT NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED I AM TROUBLED WITH MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES IN EITHER DIRECT
DID NOT GET PACKAGE WITH BACKUP CAMERA I THINK THIS SHOULD BE STANDARD
REAR VIEW CAMERA WOULD HELP IT SHOULD BE STANDARD NOW
SELECTED THE CAR BECAUSE I FELT I COULD SEE WELL WHEN DRIVING I COULD ACTUALLY SEE WHERE THE FRONT END OF THE CAR WAS WHEN DRIVING AND PARKING THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS WERE ALSO AN ESSENTIAL WHEN I WAS PICKING THE CAR
I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE SIDE ASSIST WARNING LIGHTS AND THE FRONT ASSIST NORMALLY I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED THEM IF THEY WERE AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE BUT NOW THAT I HAVE EXPERIENCED THEM THEY WILL BE A REQUIREMENT ON ANY NEW VEHICLE I ORDER
THE AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPER TECHNOLOGY COULD BE IMPROVED THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE WIPERS ACTIVATE WHEN THERE IS NO PRECIPITATION AND OTHER TIMES WHEN THERE IS PRECIPITATION ON THE WINDSHIELD AND THEY DON T ACTIVATE ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE A M
VISIBILITY OF OTHER CARS IS ENHANCED BY ELECTRONIC BLIND SPOT WARNING
LOVE THE AUTO WINDSHIELD WIPERS
BEST OVERALL VISIBILITY OF ANY SUV I HAVE EVER OWNED INCLUDING A HONDA PILOT AND JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE
I WISH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WAS A BIT LARGER
WINDSHIELD WIPER SETTINGS COULD BE BETTER ALSO USING REAR WIPERS OFTEN TRICKY
LARGE BLIND SPOTS WHEN SPIDER TOP IS UP
I DO APPRECIATE THE DOOR MOUNTED TURN SIGNAL REPEATERS I DO NOT LIKE THE RED COLORED REAR TURN SIGNALS WOULD PREFER AMBER LENSES FOR BETTER VISIBILITY AND DIFFERENTIATION FORM THE BRAKE TAIL LAMPS
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER SPEED IS TOO SLOW ON THE FAST WIPE SETTING
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT ADJUST THAT WELL WHEN RAIN INCREASES
BACK UP CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD IN A CAR OF THIS QUALITY
I M STILL ADJUSTING TO THE SIZE OF THE REAR BLIND SPOTS
SOMETIMES WHEN I TURN THE VEHICLE OFF THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS JUMP MOVE EVEN IF I HAVEN T USED THEM DURING THE DRIVE
BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE VASTLY IMPROVED THE WARNING SIGNALS ARE FANTASTIC NEED BIGGER SUN VISORS
THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR ALERT SHOULD BE A BRIGHTER COLOR PERHAPS RED THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR ONLY WORKS AT SPEEDS 40MPH AND ABOVE I D LIKE IT TO WORK AT LOWER SPEEDS
LANE CHANGING VISIBILITY OF OTHER CARS IS BAD THE HEADREST ON FRONT SEATS OBSCURE VISIBILITY AND REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE SMALL IF SIDE COLLISION FEATURE IS NOT INCLUDED THEN SPLIT REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE NECESSARY
THERE S SLIGHT BLIND SPOTS TOWARDS THE REAR SIDES WHEN CHANGING LANES I RELY MORE ON THE SIDE MIRRORS FOR ASSISTANCE THAN I D LIKE TO
VERY HARD TO SEE VEHICLES ALONG SIDE OF CAR WITH DOOR SIDE MIRRORS BAD BLIND SPOTS
VERY GOOD VISIBILITY
REAR VIEW MIRROR HAS NO ADJUSTMENTS MUST MOVE MY HAND UP OR DOWN DO NOT LIKE THIS IN AN EXPENSIVE AUTO
VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT FOR BOTH OF US AND WE ALWAYS FEEL SAFER IN AN SUV
GOOD VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT CAR HAS A SOLID FEEL ON THE ROAD
THE REAR VIEW BECAUSE OF SIZE OF BACK SEAT HEADREST AND REAR WINDOWS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CHANGE LANES FROM LEFT TO CENTER OR CENTER TO RIGHT LANE THE VIEW GIVES THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE IS A CAR IN THE NEXT LANE WHEN IN EFFECT IT IS THE BACK
NEED TO REPOSITION THE BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHTS TO THE INSIDE OF THE VEHICLE LOVE THE HEADS UP DISPLAY LANE DEPARTURE WARNING SHOULD BE A BEEP OR WARNING ALARM AND NOT THE VIBRATING STEERING WHEEL AND SHOULD ALSO BE ACTIVE AT A LOWER SPEED
VISIBILITY WHEN MOVING TO YOUR RIGHT IS NOT GREAT
I ORIGINALLY CHOSE THE X3 BECAUSE OF THE EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW
WINDSHIELD WIPERS DON T SEEM TO CONFORM TIGHTLY WITH WINDOW SOMETIMES SMEARS
THERE IS THE TYPICAL DRIVERS SIDE BLIND SPOT
WHEN CHANGING LANES B PILLAR IS THE OBSTACLE BUT THE BLIND SPOT WARNING MAKES THE DIFFERENCE
USE OF REAR BACKUP CAMERA IS VERY DIFFICULT
THE VISIBILITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE HIGHLANDER I HAD THE SAVING GRACE IS THE ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE SYSTEM BECAUSE YOU REALLY CANNOT SEE AROUND THE CAR WELL
WIPER BLADES ON CARE WERE NOT THAT GREAT
I DON T HAVE AS MUCH FORWARD VISIBILITY AS I WISH BECAUSE THE DRIVER SEAT CANNOT BE ADJUSTED HIGHER
THE REAR VISIBILITY ON THE TLX IS MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER SEDANS THAT I TESTED
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE WHEN LOOKING OVER THE RIGHT REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE ONLY COMPLAINT IS THE LANE DEPARTURE AND FRONT COLLISION WARNING CAN BE A BIT TOO SENSITIVE AT TIMES THERE ARE TIMES THE FRONT COLLISION WENT OFF AND THE ONLY CAR IN FRONT OF ME WAS ON THE NEXT LANE OVER I LANE DEPARTURE WORKS AS IT IS SUPP
COMPARED TO MY PREVIOUS CAR 2001 BMW 325I THE AUDI SEEMS TO HAVE MORE BIGGER BLINDSPOTS ESPECIALLY THE ONE CREATED BY THE B PILLAR ALSO I M STILL GETTING THE HANG OF PARKING BECAUSE SIDE AND REAR VISIBILITY ARE LIMITED NOT SURE IF IT S THE
BACK UP CAMERA IS REALLY NICE FOR BACKING UP
THE HONDA ACCORD HAS A CAMERA ON THE RIGHT SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT TURNS ON WHEN CHANGING LANES THIS MODEL SHOULD HAVE HAD THAT FEATURE AS WELL
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHTS
THERE ARE LARGE BLIND SPOTS CAUSED BY THE B PILLAR OF THE CAR TO THE SIDES THE HEADLIGHTS DO NOT HAVE MUCH IN TERMS OF RANGE AT HIGHWAY SPEEDS ON LOW BEAM
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SEEMS SMALL THE CAR HAS SOME WICKED BLIND SPOTS SO THE BLIND SPOT ASSISTANCE FEATURE IS TRULY HELPFUL HOPE THOSE LIGHTS AND SENSORS DON T FAIL
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE SAFETY ITEMS INDIVIDUALLY WITHOUT HAVING TO PURCHASE ITEMS YOU DON T WANT SUCH AS NAVIGATION WHEN ALL YOU WANT IS BLIND SPOT MONITORING
TECHNOLOGY ON THE ADVANCED TLX IS AWESOME SAFETY WAS REALLY A CONCERN WHEN ACURA BUILT THIS CAR
MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE A REARVIEW CAMERA THUS IT IS A CHALLENGE WHEN BACKING
I LOVE HOW THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE AUTOMATIC AND THE HEADLIGHTS ARE SO SEXY LOOKING
GOOD AUDI SIDE ASSIST PARKING SYSTEM REARVIEW CAMERA
I LIVE IN THE DESERT SO HAVE HAD NO EXPERIENCE YET AS TO DRIVING IN THE RAIN THE SUN VISOR IS BAFFLING WHEN SUN IS GLARING IN FROM THE RIGHT OR NEAR THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THE VISOR IS USELESS THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM WHEN HEADING WEST IN THE LA
BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE COMPARED TO OTHER CARS I VE DRIVEN
SIDE MIRRORS AND SIDE AND REAR WINDOWS NEED IMPROVEMENT OF VISIBILITY
I HAVE A CONVERTIBLE SO THERE IS A BLIND SPOT I AM ADJUSTING TO
IT HAS A BLIND SPOT SENSOR BUT I DON T TRUST IT BECAUSE IT DOESN T SEEM TO ALWAYS RECOGNIZE VEHICLES BESIDE ME AND SOMETIMES IT FLASHES WHEN MOVING TO CENTER LANE BUT THE ONLY CAR IS TWO LANES OVER
I LOVE THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS
HEADLIGHTS ARE GOOD BUT THE VISIBILITY OF THE ROAD ON STREETS HIGHWAYS WITH NO LIGHTING IS NOT SUFFICIENT
LOVE THE SIDE CAMERA MY CAR IS A CONVERTIBLE AND THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL BLIND SPOTS
CAR NEEDS A REAR WINDOW WIPER
COULD BE A BETTER DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR FOR BLIND SPOTS SHOULD ADD WARNINGS ALSO WHY NOT HAVE A CAMERA AND DISPLAY WHEN TURNING RIGHT LIKE MY HONDA ACCORD HAD
GOOD FORWARD VISIBILITY REAR VISIBILITY FEELS SOMEWHAT LIMITED AND THE B PILLAR IS VERY WIDE BOTH TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO
CAN T SEE FRONT OF CAR AND DON T UNDERSTAND THE BACKUP SYSTEM
THE REAR ASSIST CAMERA DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK SOMETIMES THE SCREEN IS BLACK THIS BEGAN HAPPENING THE WEEK I TOOK THE VEHICLE HOME
STOCK WINDSHIELD WIPERS SEEM TO BE OF LOW QUALITY
SIDE VISIBILITY IS POOR
THE VISIBILITY IS MORE THAN OUTSTANDING AND THE BACK UP CAMERA WITH FRONT AND REAR SENSORS SIMPLIFY PARKING IN A TIGHT GARAGE AS WELL AS ON THE STREET THE ABILITY TO SEE EVERYTHING IS MORE THAN I COULD HAVE HOPED FOR THE POWER AND BREAKING
HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW BLIND SPOT INDICATOR SYSTEM HELPS GREATLY WITHOUT IT I WOULD BE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE DRIVING THE CAR
I RESEARCHED THE SUV BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS ONE AND LIKE THAT IS IT TOP RATED FOR SAFETY
THE REAR WINDOW IS A LITTLE SMALL AND VISIBILITY SEEMS LIMITED BUT I AM GETTING USED TO IT
VEHICLE A TAD TOO LARGE & THE ENCORE WAS WAY TOO SMALL ESPECIALLY LIKE FRONT END APPEARANCE NEED UPDATE ON INFOTAINMENT CENTER AND LARGER SCREEN TO READ NAVIGATION
A LITTLE HARD TO SEE IN BACK AND ON SIDES WHILE DRIVING SO THE WARNING SYSTEMS ARE ESSENTIAL ESPECIALLY THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS
THE POOR DESIGN OF THE LANE CHANGE WARNING IT A MAJOR ISSUE BECAUSE I HAVE OTHER CARS WITH MUCH BETTER MORE RELIABLE SYSTEMS THUS I HAVE TO CATCH MYSELF FROM RELYING ON THE BMW SYSTEM WHICH IS SPOTTY AT BEST
WISH THERE WAS A HEADS UP DISPLAY IN THE ENCLAVE
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS THANK GOODNESS I HAVE THE WARNING SYSTEM
NEITHER MY HUSBAND NOR I CAN SEE THE HOOD OF THIS CAR WHILE DRIVING AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE A BLIND SPOT ON THE RIGHT WHEN MAKING A LEFT HAND TURN FROM STOP
FRONT WINDOW POSTS ARE TOO LARGE AND BLOCK VISIBILITY TO THE FRONT
THIS MODEL IS AN IMPROVEMENT WITH BETTER VISIBILITY RE SIDE MIRRORS LAST LA CROSS I OWNED WAS SO BLOCKED IT WAS DANGEROUS
MY LACROSSE AND MY LACROSSE HAD BLIND AREAS WHICH IS WHY WE ORDERED ALL THE NEW SAFETY FEATURES ON THE NEW VEHICLE
THE MIRROR SENSORS COMPENSATE FOR THE BLIND SPOTS
LANE CHANGE VISIBILITY
OVERALL I LIKE THE VISABILITY
SEEMS TO HAVE BLINDSPOT ON DRIVER S SIDE
THE LIGHTS WERE TOO FOCUSED ON THE ROAD WHEN DRIVING DOWNHILL LATE AT NIGHT ON A DARK WINDING ROAD LOST THE FRONT VIEW MOMENTARILY
VISIBILITY IS NOT VERY GOOD TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS
BECAUSE OF WIDE POSTS IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS FROM THE SIDES HOWEVER THIS CAR HAS THE SAFETY FEATURES WHICH I WANTED SO IT PRETTY MUCH TAKES CARE OF THE BLIND SPOTS
HAVE BLIND SPOT WITH OUTSIDE MIRRORS WHEN CHANGING LANES
THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLES REAR WINDSHIELD MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF IT BUT HAVING THE CAMERA HELPS ALSO THE SIDE MIRRORS SOMEWHAT BLOCK VISION AT INTERSECTIONS
THE HIGH REAR TRUCK PROFILE THE HIGH HEAD RESTS AND SMALLER SIDE AND REAR WINDOWS THICKER ROOF SUPPORTS MAKE ALL AROUND VISIBILITY A MAJOR PROBLEM BUICK IS NOT ALONE IN THIS REGARD
BLIND SPOTS CAUSED BY INTERIOR DESIGN
I LITTLE BIT CONCERNED BECAUSE BUICK REGAL GS DOESN T HAVE FOG LIGHTS BUT I HAVEN DRIVEN IT IN FOG CONDITIONS YET MY PREVIOUS PONTIAC G6 HAD FOG LIGHTS AND IT REALLY HELPED AS I WEAR READING GLASSES
THE REAR CAMERA EXPOSURE AND WARNING BLEEPERS ARE A DEFINITE PLUS WHEN BACKING
GREATER VISIBILITY BOTH REAR AND FORWARD
ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I BOUGHT THE VEHICLE WAS BECAUSE OF THE BLIND SPOT SIGNAL IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS AND THE REAR CROSS TRAFFIC ALARM THAT I GOT USED TO HAVING ON MY PREVIOUS CAR THE REGAL
WISH VEHICLE HAD REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER
I NOTICED THE BLIND SPOTS ARE VERY PREVALENT IN THIS CAR I WISH WE HAD THE CAR INDICATOR THAT TELLS YOU SOME IS IN THE LANE NEXT TO YOU
PASSENGER HEAD REST CAN BLOCK VISIBILITY OUT RIGHT SIDE WINDOWS POOR VISIBILITY OUT REAR WINDOW
WHEN BACKING UP IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS WOULD TILT DOWNWARD MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO SEE THE GROUND AS THE VEHICLE IS BACKING UP OUR CHRYSLER 300 HAD THIS FEATURE THIS IS A SAFETY FEATURE
THE FRONT ROOF PILLARS CONTINUE TO OBSTRUCT VISIBILITY IT S TOO EARLY TO KNOW HOW GOOD THE WIPERS ARE BUT IN MY THEY DID A VERY POOR JOB OF CLEANING THE WINDSHIELD
SOMETIMES HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH FRONT ROOF PILLARS CAUSING A BLIND SPOT
THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOT
THE SUN VISORS ARE NOT LONG ENOUGH TO BLOCK OUT THE MAJORITY OF THE SUN HARD TO ADJUST THE REAR VIEW MIRROS DUE TO ALL THE THINGS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINDSHIELD
THERE SEEMS TO BE A BLIND SPOT AREA FRONT DRIVER AND PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW WHERE BAR IS LOCATED
THE FEATURE THAT ON THE BACK UP CAMERA THE VEHICLE PATH INDICATOR LINES TURN WITH THE WHEEL IS MUCH APPRECIATED THAT AND THE NICE SIDE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS WERE VERY BIG FACTORS IN OUR DECISION TO PURCHASE
SOMEWHAT OF A BLIND SPOT WHERE THE SMALL WINDOWS ARE IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER AND PASSENGER WINDOWS
THE VISIBILITY IS VERY GOOD ESPECIALLY SINCE THE SEATS ADJUST TO GIVE YOU WHATEVER PERSPECTIVE YOU WANT I LIKE MY SEAT HIGH SO I CAN SEE ALL AROUND AND THE ENCORE ALLOWS THIS IT S A VERY APPEALING ASPECT
THERE S A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING FRONT RIGHT & THERE IS SOME DIFFICULTY LOOKING LEFT & TO THE REAR BECAUSE OF THE POST BETWEEN THE LEFT SIDE DOORS
B PILLAR HINDERS VISIBILITY SLIGHTLY I FIND THIS WITH MOST CARS I VE DRIVEN
I REALLY LOVE ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURES THAT MY LACROSSE HAS I LOVE DRIVING THIS CAR
WIDE POST DOOR FRAMES AREA BETWEEN DRIVER S SIDE WINDOWS CREATES SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT
SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL HAVE TO RELY ON LOOKING BACK EVERY TIME FOR BLIND SPOTS
NEED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE SPEEDOMETER BETTER
THIS VEHICLE FEELS LIKE A WELL MADE PIECE OF MACHINERY IT IS A PLEASURE TO DRIVE AND HANDLES WELL THE HEADLIGHTS ARE EXCEPTIONAL NOT ONLY IN STYLE BUT FUNCTION THE RAIN SENSE WINDSHIELD WIPERS NOT ONLY WORK WELL BUT HAVING THE WIPERS AUTOMATICA
I DO SOMETIMES HAVE AN ISSUE WITH A BLIND SPOT IN THE PASSENGER REAR QUARTER
IF REAR SEATS ARE UP THE VISIBILITY IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS LIMITED WITH THE SEATS DOWN THE VISIBILITY IS GOOD
I FEEL LIKE THIS VEHICLE IS VERY LIGHT FOR EXAMPLE THE REAR DOOR IS SO LIGHT I WORRY ABOUT IMPACT I HAVE HAD TROUBLE WITH GETTING ACCUSTOMED TO THE BLIND SPOTS IN THIS VEHICLE THE LEFT HAND FRAME ON THE DRIVER S SIDE BLOCKS VISION WHEN TAKING
I AM GLAD THE VEHICLE HAS THE BLIND SPOT WARNINGS IN THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS BECAUSE THIS CAR HAS THE BIGGEST BLIND SPOTS OF ANY I VE EVER DRIVEN IT WAS INITIALLY QUITE DISCONCERTING BUT I VE NOW GOTTEN USED TO IT
VERY HARD FOR DRIVER TO LOOK BACK AT RIGHT SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES OR PULLING OUT FROM STOP DUE TO SEATS BLOCKNG WINDOW VIEW ALSO SIZE OF DEAD SPACE BETWEEN WINDOWS THIS NEEDS TO BE OPENED UO FOR BETTER VIEWING AND SAFETY
BLIND SPOT WHEN IN DRIVER S SEAT RIGHT FRONT WINDOW POST BLOCKS CARS COMING 90 DEGREES FROM THE RIGHT
POOR REAR QUARTER VISIBILITY
REAR WINDOWS ARE TINTED AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY WHEN EXITING A DRIVEWAY ON AN ANGLE MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE TRAFFIC COMING AT AN OBLIQUE ANGLE PLACEMENT OF THE BAR BETWEEN FRONT WINDOWS AND SMALL FIXED WINDOW IMPAIRS
HARD TO SEE OUT BACK WINDOW BAD BLIND SPOTS
A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES BLIND SPOT OUT OF BACK DOOR AREA
WITH THE HIGHER PROFILES OF TRUNK LIDS TODAY ONE CAN NO LONGER SEE THE END OF THE CAR AND MUST RELY ON THE BACK UP CAMERA SYSTEM
GREAT VISABILITY LOVE THE R BLIND SPOT INDICATOR
THE SIDE AND BACK VISIBILITY OF THE ENCORE IS POOR RELATIVE TO OTHER VEHICLES AND OTHER BUICKS I VE OWNED YES THE BACK UP CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEMS AIM TO COMPENSATE FOR THE DESIGN S BLIND SPOTS BUT I DON T APPRECIATE HAVING TO RELY
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SHOUD BE A LITTLE LARGER
THE BACK SEAT HEADREST BLOCK THE REAR VIEW TO SOME EXTENT
VISOR MATERIAL FEELS CHEAP AND WOULD LIKE EXTENSION OPTION WHEN MOVED TO SIDE WINDOW LOVE THE RAIN SENSOR OPTION IMPRESSED W HEADLIGHT SENSORS AND TURNING SENSOR
THE SCREEN WHICH PROJECTS THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA IS A BIT DIFFICULT TO SEE I FIND MYSELF NOT TRUSTING IT AND INSTEAD LOOKING BEHIND ME WHEN IN REVERSE
SEEING IN THE BLIND SPOT IS STILL AN ISSUE WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING AREA ALSO THE CORNER IN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS WIDER AND LIMITS VISIBILITY WHEN PULLING INTO TRAFFIC
TONS OF BAD BLIND SPOTS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE BEHIND YOU WHEN THE DVD PLAYER IS DOWN IN BACK
THE 360 DEGREE CAMERA SYSTEM WITH BIRDS EYE VIEW IS AWESOME
GREAT BACK UP CAMERA
360 CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY POOR TOO ALL CAMERAS ON THIS CAR ARE VERY VERY POOR
HEADS UP DISPLAY IS AN EXCELLENT AND VERY EFFECTIVE SYSTEM FOR SAFETY AND ATTENTION TO THE ROAD AND TRAFFIC CONDITIONS WE NEED MORE OF THIS SYSTEM IN ALL CARS
WITH THE THIRD ROW SEATS NOW HIGHER IT OBSTRUCTS THE REAR VIEW
THE CTS HAD A HUGE BLOCK ON EACH SIDE OF THE FRONT WINDOW THIS THICK BLOCK HINDER VISIBILITY ON EACH SIDE OF THE CAR I DO NOT NOTICE THIS ON THE CTS
LIKE OTHER VEHICLES IT HAS BLIND SPOTS SUN VISORS ARE TOO NARROW AND SMALL TO BLOCK SUN BUT FIT JUST RIGHT IN THE SPACE PROVIDED
DRIVER SIDE PILLAR BETWEEN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND DRIVER SIDE WINDOW LIMITS VISABILITY
VISIBILITY AND DRIVE POSITION ARE EXCELLENT
FRONT VISIBILITY IS MORE DIFFICULT WHEN PARKING THE VEHICLE
FOR MY HEIGHT AND SIZE THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS CONCERNING OTHER VEHICLES COMING FROM THE SIDE
THE FRAME BETWEEN THE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND THE SIDE MIRROR CAUSES A BLIND SPOT IN ORDER TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING HIDDEN AT THAT ANGLE I MUST LEAN FORWARD TO LOOK AROUND IT
AUTOMATIC CONTROL OF HEADLIGHT BRIGHTNESS IS SOMEWHAT FLAWED THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS AT THE SIDES OF WINDSHIELD THAT MAY BE LARGER THAN OTHER VEHICLES
IMAGE QUALITY ON BACKUP BIRD S EYE CAMERA IS VERY POOR
I LOVE THE DRIVER AWARENESS PACKAGE I REALLY ENJOY THE BACK CAMERA ESPECIALLY
THE OLD STYLE CADILLAC ESCALADES WERE SOOO MUCH EASIER TO SEE OUT OF VISIBILITY WITH THE THIRD ROW HEADRESTS IN PLACE IS MORE DIFFICULT WE REMOVED THEM
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ARE SO LARGE AND PLACED IN SUCH MANNER THAT SOMETIMES IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE AROUND OVER THEM
POOR VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK
HUGE BLIND SPOT ON EITHER SIDE OF FRONT WINDSHIELD DUE TO COLUMNS AND OUTSIDE DOOR MIRRORS SAME FOR OVER THE SHOULDER VIEW TOWARDS REAR WINDOW
SUN VISORS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS THE DOUBLE VISOR THAT WAS IN 99 BUICK AND REAR VIEW MIRROR SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY ADJUST FOR LIGHTS FROM BEHIND TO DECREASE GLARE
THERE ARE MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN DRIVING IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS TO THE SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES ON BOTH SIDES I HAVE HAD MORE THAN A FEW CLOSE CALLS AND I HAVE ONLY OWNED THE VEHICLE A FEW MONTHS
ALTHOUGH I HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY USING THE MIRRORS IN THE DRIVERS SEAT MY PREVIOUS SRX AFFORDED ME BETTER USE OF THE 3 MIRRORS WHILE I WAS DRIVING I DO LIKE THE FACT THAT I AM ABLE TO KNOW WHEN IT IS SAFE TO CHANGE LANES BECAUSE THE SID
BACK UP CAMERA IS AWESOME
HUGE BLIND SPOTS BECAUSE OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WINDOW FRAME GOING LEFT AROUND SHARP PIG TAIL CURVES IN THE MOUNTAINS IS SCARY
MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL NOW CAN T SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES TOWING OR BACKING POORER VISIBILITY AROUND THE MIRROR AREA ALONG UPPER WINDOW BAD BLIND SPOT VIEW OUT OF THE REAR OF VEHICLE IS DIMINISHED AND IS A MUCH SMALLER AREA TO LOOK OUT OF
SOMETIMES THERE IS A BLIND SPOT JUST HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT & BE CAREFUL
I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AND BLIND SPOT WARNING FEATURES
I WANT A WAY TO HAVE A BEEPER FOR REAR PARK ASSIST THAT IS LOUDER AND MORE RESPONSIVE THIS IS A POOR SYSTEM WITH A GOOD CAMERA
FRONT BLIND SPOTS CAN BE TROUBLING
THE SIDE POST CREATE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES LOOKING TO THE LEFT CAN T SEE FRONT END OVER DASH BOARD
THE FORWARD COLLISION UNIT HAS PREVENTED AN ACCIDENT ALREADY
THE ONLY THING FOR VISIBILITY THAT COULD BE CHANGED IS TO HAVE BIGGER SIDE MIRRORS
CHANGING LANES GOOD ONLY BECAUSE OF ALERT PICTURE ALERT SYSTEM FOR OUT OF LANE AND COLLISION I CAN NOT COUNT ON IT
SIDE MIRRORS HAVE AVERAGE VISIBILITY BACK WINDOW IS SMALL
REAR VIEW MIRROR IS SMALL
LANE DEPARTURE AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE ARE SLIGHTLY ANNOYING LD YOU CAN DEFEAT COLLISION AVOIDANCE RED DOTS PROJECTED ON WINDSHIELD YOU CANNOT
THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS WORK VERY WELL AND ARE EXTREMELY HELPFUL AS ARE ALL THE OTHER WARNINGS SUCH AS THE VIBRATION IN THE SEAT WHEN YOU CROSS THE YELLOW OR WHITE LINE
THERE ARE MULTIPLE BLIND SPOTS IN THIS CAR
SEEMS TO HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY FROM ALL ANGLES
BAD THING IS THE FRONT PANELS ARE TOO WIDE BLOCKS YOUR FORWARD VISIBILITY
THE HEAD RESTS ON THE THIRD SEATS LIMIT REAR VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT VISIBILITY IS NOT GOOD BUT THE MIRRORS AIDE BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM WOULD BE MUCH PREFERRED IN THIS MODEL
ADJUSTMENT OF MIRRORS IS VERY CRITICAL TO ASSURE NO BLIND SPOTS
WHEN BACKING UP VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR
BLIND SPOT WARNING SYSTEM SHOULD COME WITH ALL CAMARO S
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT BUT IT S NOT BAD AND THE MIRRORS ARE REALLY GOOD FOR HAVING A BROAD VIEW
BLIND SPOT OVER LEFT SHOULDER
BAD BLIND SPOTS
THE REAR VISIBILITY STRAIGHT BEHIND THE CAR ISN T BAD BUT VIEWING REARWARDS AT A 45 DEGREE ANGLE IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE THE BACK UP CAMERA HELPS SIGNIFICANTLY
THANK GOODNESS FOR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA OTHERWISE I THINK IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK
I HAVE A CONVERTABLE SO THE VISIBILITY IS EXCEPTIONAL WHEN I HAVE THE TOP DOWN THE SUN VISORS ARE TINY AND COVERED IN A STICKER
MAYBE ADDING MORE SAFETY FEATURES LIKE CHANGING LANE WARNING
BLIND SPOT OVER REAR QUARTER PANELS
THE OLDER MODELS HAD MORE GLASS AND BETTER VISIBILITY
SIDE MIRRORS COULD HAVE STAYED AS SAME AS THE LAST GENERATION TO HAVE A WIDER REAR VIEW
LED HEADLIGHTS ARE AMAZING
THE BLIND SPOT SIGN THE TRIANGLE ON THE SIDE VIEW MIRROR SHOULD HAVE A BRIGHTER APPEARANCE AND FLASH MORE THE WAY IT IS IT S NOT EASY TO NOTICE SPECIALLY DURING THE DAYLIGHT ALSO IT S BEEN VERY HARD TO MY HUSBAND THAT IS SLIGHTLY COLOR BLIND
ALL VEHICLES SHOULD COME WITH BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND FCW STANDARD
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE ALL BMWS HAVE THE FRONT WINDSHIELD DISPLAY THE VEHICLE S SPEED I THINK THIS ADDS TO DRIVING SAFETY DAY OR NIGHT
THANK GOD FOR THE BACK UP CAMERA
FOR THE PRICE OF THE CAR THE SAFETY FEATURES LIKE BLIND SPOT ASSIST SHOULD COME DEFAULT EVEN CIVIC COMES WITH THESE FEATURES LITTLE DISAPPOINTED NOT TO SEE THIS FEATURE WHICH IS NOWADAYS ON ALL LUXARY CARS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE OTHER VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT WHEN LANE CHANGING THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS SHOULD HAVE A CURVED SECTION TO SHOW VEHICLES IN THE BLIND SPOT
I APPRECIATE THE BACK UP CAMERA AS AN ADDED SAFETY FEATURE
BACK UP CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SPOT MIRRORS BUILT INTO THE OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS I ADDED ONE TO EACH MIRROR TO COVER THE BLIND SPOT
LOVE IT ALL BACK UP CAMERA IS EXCELLENT
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS SEEM TO BE IN THE DIRECT LINE OF SIGHT WHEN CHANGING LANES OR GOING AROUND CORNERS THE SUN VISORS ARE FAIRLY USELESS
I HAD A 5 SERIES BEFORE BUT THIS 4 SERIES S BACK UP CAMERA AT NIGHT VERY HARD TO SEE
SAFETY FEATURES WAS BIG COMPONENT IN PURCHASING THE BMW
HUD AND COLLISION DETECTION MAKE THE CAR MUCH EASIER AND SAFER TO DRIVE
GREAT VISIBILITY AND FEEL SAFE
POOR REAR VISION CAMERA MAKES UP FOR IT
REAR VIEW CAMERA OFTEN DIFFICULT TO USE IN THE RAIN DUE TO WATER ON THE LENS
BLIND SPOT WARNING IS SO COMMON IN COMPETITORS I M SURPRISED IT ISN T A STANDARD FEATURE ON THIS CAR
 THIS IS MY SECOND 435I MY FIRST WAS TOTALED AND THE ARE SAFETY AND STABILITY SAVED MY LIFE SO I BOUGHT THE SAME CAR
HAS A BLIND SPOT JUST TO THE REAR DO THE DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW
HEAD UP DISPLAY IS AWESOME
THE RIGHT SIDE WALL CONSTRUCTION LEAVES A BIG BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING TO THE RIGHT FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OFF TO THE SIDES OF THE VEHICLE PREVIOUS MODELS HAD WIDE ANGLE MIRRORS TO HELP THESE HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED
HARD TO SEE CAR IN BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OUT OF DRIVERS WINDOW
REAR VISIBILITY LIMITED WITH HIGH REAR DECK AND SMALL REAR WINDOW
BACK UP VISIBILITY IS POOR
THERE ARE A FEW BLIND SPOTS THE CARGO WINDOWS ARE RATHER SMALL SO IT CAN BE TOUGH TO SEE WHEN BACKING UP EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A REAR CAMERA
THE MIRRORS SEEM TO CREATE BLINDSPOT WHEN TURNING
I REALLY LIKE HOW THE BLIND SPOT ALERT WORKS WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN AUDIO ALERT WHEN ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE LANES WHILE THE ALERT ON THE MIRROR IS ON
THE DRIVER SUNVISOR STRIKES THE REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN FOLDED DOWN THIS REQUIRES ADJUSTMENT OF BOTH
THE RANGE FOR THE BLIND SPOT IS PRETTY BIG YOU REALLY NEED TO LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER WHEN CHANGING LANES
IT S HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE REAR WINDOWS WHEN CHANGING LANES BIG BLIND SPOTS
DIFFICULT TO SEE FRONT OF CAR WHEN PARKING BACKUP CAMERA AND SENSORS MAKE REAR PARKING OK OR WOULD HAVE SAME PROBLEM AS FRONT
THERE IS PLENTY OF VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S POSITION
ONLY ISSUE ALTHOUGH MINOR IS REAR VIEW VISIBILITY DUE TO HIGH REAR SEATS
I CANNOT GET USE TO THE LIMITED VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING DIRECTLY OUT THE REAR WINDOW OR VIA THE REARVIEW MIRROR THE BACK DASH IS SO HIGH I CANT T SEE CARS BEHIND ME IF THEY ARE FOLLOWING CLOSE I ALSO CAN T SEEM TO GET THE SIDEVIEW MIRRORS ADJU
BIG BODY EQUALS BIG WINDOWS AND WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY ITS VERY EASY TO SEE OUT OF AND DRIVE
HARD TO SEE OUT OF THE BACK WINDOW AND THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S SIDE BUT THOSE ARE COUNTER ACTED BY THE EXCELLENT WARNING SYSTEM THAT TELLS YOU THE LOCATION OF VEHICLES YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE
THE TRUNK GOES UP AND I CANNOT SEE THE REAR I DO NOT LIKE REAR CAMERAS I WANT TO SEE I ALSO WANT TO SEE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ON THE REAR WINDOW
A BIT OF A CHALLENGE SEEING YOUR BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE WHEN CHANGING LANES
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
I REALLY LIKE THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE WARNING SYSTEM
CAN T REALLY SEE OUT THE REAR WINDOW BECAUSE I CAN T ADJUST HEIGHT OF THE SEAT AND THAT ALSO CREATE A BIGGER BLIND SPOT FOR ME
I LOVE THE MIRROR LIGHTING UP WHEN THERE IS A VEHICLE IN MY BLIND SPOTS THE VEHICLE ALSO ALERTS ME IF I GO OUT OF THE LANE WITHOUT THE TURN SIGNAL ON
I FIND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS TOO SMALL TO SEE WELL I AM USE TO A LARGER VIEW THIS IS THE ONLY PROBLEM I WOULD CORRECT REGARDING THE CAR EVERYTHING ELSE I LOVE
I LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA AND THE BLIND SPOT DETECTORS VERY SMART ESPECIALLY FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME THAT HAS ISSUES BACKING UP I AM A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK BY ALL THE ALERTS BUT I KNOW THEY RE FOR MY SAFETY WHICH IS WONDERFUL
I LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA
BLIND SPOT ON REAR SIDE
WHEN SUNVISOR IS PULLED DOWN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS IN THE WAY
BACK UP CAMERA HAS A LEARNING CURVE
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS A GREAT FEATURE
SOMETHING ABOUT THE SIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS BLOCK VIEW OF CURBS
GOOD THING IT HAS THE SIDE SAFETY LIGHTS VERY DIFFICULT TO VIEW
REAR WINDOW IS SMALL BLIND SPOT MIRRORS WOULD BE A PLUS
MUCH HAS BEEN MADE BY SOME OF POOR VISIBILITY FOR THE DRIVER THROUGH THE REAR WINDOW CONSEQUENTLY I WAS APPREHENSIVE ABOUT THIS BUT HAVE HAD NO PROBLEM WHATEVER WITH THIS
REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT IS HORRIBLE THE FASTBACK STYLING THAT IS ALL THE RAGE NOW IS THE CULPRIT I M GRATEFUL FOR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA AND THE ULTRASONIC BACKUP SENSORS TO HELP WITH REVERSING THE VEHICLE
MIRROR ALIGNMENT IS A LITTLE TRICKY WITH THE SHAPE OF THE GLASS BUT BLIND SPOT WARNING MAKES IT ALMOST A NON ISSUE
REAR VIEW MIRROR VIEW IS GOOD BUT VIEW SEEMS LIMITED WHEN TURNING AROUND TO BACK UP CAMERA IS NICE BUT I HAVEN T LEARNED TO TRUST IT YET
THERE SEEMS TO BE BLIND SPOTS
HEADS UP DISPLAY WOULD BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT BLIND SPOT MIRROR COULD BE BIGGER
LOVE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL
THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS YOU CANT SEE OUT THE BACK DOOR WINDOWS AT ALL UNLESS YOU HAVE YOUR SEAT ALL THE WAY UP AS THE HEAD REST BLOCKS THE REAR DOOR WINDOW
REFLECTION AT NIGHT OF RADIO CONTROLS IN REAR WINDOW
MY DRIVER SIDE MIRROR HAS A FISH EYE MIRROR IN IT I THINK THAT A PASSENGER SIDE SHOULD BE INSTALLED ALSO
WOULD LIKE TO SEE BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON PASSENGER SIDE SIMILAR TO DRIVES SIDE
I WAS UNABLE TO FIND A VEHICLE THAT MET MY OTHER CRITERIA THAT HAD LANE DEPARTURE WARNING BLIND SPOT MONITORING AND FORWARD COLLISION WARNING IN MY AREA THOSE WERE OPTIONS I DESIRED BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO GET THERE WERE OTHER THINGS COLOR Z71
THE LED ISSUE IN THE SIDE MIRRORS PRVIOUSLY MENTIONED THE VISIBILITY ISSUES STEM FROM THE RIDE HEIGHT OF THE VEHICLE
LIMITED VISIBILITY WITH THE TRAILER PACKAGE EXTERIOR MIRRORS BLIND SPOTS WHEN ANOTHER VEHICLE IS ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE VEHICLE
NEED BETTER HEADLIGHTS FOR MORE VISABILITY
REAR VISIBILITY AND SIDE PASSING REAR VISIBILITY COULD BE BETTER
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A BIGGER BLIND SPOT THAN I DO BUT IT MAKES ME DOUBLE AND TRIPLE CHECK AND CONTORT TO MAKE SURE I AM CLEAR
TO MANY BLIND SPOTS WHILE BACKING UP SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD BE LARGER OR SHAPED DIFFERENTLY
I LIKE THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
THE HIGH NUMBER OF AIRBAGS IN THIS SIZE PRICE CATEGORY IS EXCEPTIONAL
BACK UP CAMERA HAS BLIND SPOTS THIS SHOULD BE STRESSE TO ALL BUYERS
A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS THROUGH THE POSTS WHEN TURNING
THE DRIVERS BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES ON THE HIGHWAY IS BAD
WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE THE BACK SEAT HEADRESTS FULLY DISAPPEAR WHEN PUSHED ALL THE WAY DOWN THEY CAUSE A SMALL BLIND SPOT
VISIBILITY OUT THE UPPER WINDSHIELD COULD BE BETTER AS A TALL 6 4 DRIVER I NEED TO BEND DOWN TO SEE TRAFFIC LIGHTS I ALSO DISLIKE THE UPPER TINT BAND ON THE WINDSHIELD
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT REAR OF THE CAR BECAUSE OF THE REAR ROOF SUPPORT BEAMS
SIDE MIRRORS TOO SMALL SHAPE OF THE SIDE MIRRORS DOES NOT HELP WITH VISIBILITY
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT MY CHEVY SPARKS VEHICLE VISIBILITY & DRIVING SAFETY
MAJOR BLIND SPOT TO THE REAR LEFT OF DRIVER
NOT SURE I LIKE THE SHAPE OF THE SIDE MIRRORS THE FACT THE MIRRORS ARE SMALLER FARTHER FROM THE VEHICLE MAKES ME UNSURE OF WHAT IS BESIDE ME SOMETIMES IF FEELS LIKE I HAVE A BIG BLIND SPOT EVEN WHEN LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER I THINK THAT IS
BACKUP CAMERA WOULD BE NICE
THERE IS A PRETTY GOOD BLIND SPOT ESPECIALLY LOOKING TO THE PASSENGER SIDE WHILE DRIVING
THE HEADRESTS THAT ARE ON THE BACK SEATS ARE VERY HIGH WHEN I LOOK THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR I FEEL AS IF I AM LOOKING THROUGH A TUNNEL IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FEEL SAFE WHILE BACKING UP
I JUST WISH THAT ALL THE 2500 HD CAME WITH TRAILER MIRRORS I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY DELIVERED MY TRUCK AND THE FIRST THINK I NOTICE WAS NO TRAILER MIRRORS JUST STANDARD ONES YOU WOULD THINK THAT 2500HD TRUCKS BECAUSE OF TRAILING SAFET
SUN VISORS ARE SMALL AND COULD BE IMPROVED WITH A SLIDE OUT AND OR INCREASED HEIGHT SIDE MIRRORS COULD HAVE JUST A TOUCH INCREASE IN THE FIELD OF VIEW 5% THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS OBSTRUCT THE RANGE OF VIEW THROUGH THE REAR VIEW MIRROR OTHERWI
THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE SIDES AND BACK OF THE VEHICLE IS NOT GREAT BUT THE ELECTRONIC SENSORS MAKE IT EXTREMELY EASY TO KNOW WHAT S AROUND THE VEHICLE
THE WIPERS LEAVE A BEADED FILM OF WATER IN THEIR PATH THE REAR WINDOWS ARE SMALL BECAUSE CHEVY S AESTHETIC BUT THIS HAMPERS VISIBILITY
THE CAR NEEDS A REVERSE CAMERA IT WOULD HELP TREMENDOUSLY EVEN MOTION SAFETY WHEN TO CLOSE TO OBJECTS WOULD BE A PLUS
SMALL CAR PLENTY OF AIR BAGS QUICK TO GET OUT OF THE WAY EASY TO SEE I M OLD SCHOOL AND GENERALLY DON T CARE FOR TRACTION CONTROL AND ABS BUT I LL LEARN TO DEAL WITH THEM
I FIND IT DIFFICULT SEEING BEHIND THE VEHICLE WHILE IN THE DRIVER S SEAT SEEMS TO BE MORE BLINDS SPOTS IN THIS MODEL COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS MODEL
I LIKE SITTING UP HIGH BUT THE ROOF SUPPORT POSTS ARE WAY TOO WIDE CAUSING UNNEEDED BLINDSPOTS
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOT FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT INTO ON OF THE VEHICLE CORNERS TYPICALLY THIS WOULD BE OVERCOME WITH THE MIRRORS BUT BECAUSE OF THEIR SIZE THIS CAN BE DIFFICULT
HEADLIGHTS NEED TO BE BRIGHTER AND REAR WIPERS ARE INADEQUATE NEED LARGER BLADE FOR COVERAGE IN STATES WITH HEAVY SNOW FALL
HARD TO SEE OUTSIDE OF VEHICLE LOOKING BACK WITH MANY BLIND SPOTS AND SEAT INTERFERENCE WITH LINE OF SIGHT I LIKE THE LANE COLLISION LIGHT IN THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS
THE HEAD RESTS ON THE SECOND ROW SEATS OBSTRUCT THE VIEW IN PARKING OUT OF A DIAGONAL PARKING SPOT THE CAMERA HELPS SOME BUT IT STILL IS ANNOYING NOT TO SEE WITH THE NAKED EYE
VERY SAFE VEHICLE 5 STAR SAFETY RATING
SOME REAR VISIBILITY IS LOST I NOTICED IN THIS VEHICLE FROM OTHERS I HAVE DRIVEN
THE LEFT OUTSIDE MIRROR HAS A CIRCULAR MIRROR ATTACHED TO IT TO INDICATE IF A VEHICLE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT THIS FEATURE IS WORTHLESS
SITTING HIGH AND GOOD VISABILITY
THE REAR WINDOW WIPER SHOULD CLEAR MORE OF THE GLASS I E BE LARGER WHEN IT TURNS OFF THERE IS ALSO A NOISE AS IT TUCKS ITSELF AWAY THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT S BROKEN
BACKUP CAMERA AND PROXIMITY SENSORS
VERY FEW IF ANY BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOTS AT REAR SIDES OF VEHICLE
BLIND SPOTS ARE TRICKY
VISIBILITY FOR BLIND SPOTS IS POOR BUT THE BLIND SPOT SENSORS MAKE UP FOR IT THEY ARE REALLY HELPFUL
REAR VIEW VISION WITHOUT THE CAMERA IS NOT GOOD GLAD TO HAVE THE ASSISTANCE
IT DOES HAVE A BLIND SPOT
MY MARKING A 4 FOR REAR VISIBILITY REFERS ONLY TO THE USE OF MIRRORS THE BACK UP CAMERA IN THIS CAR IS A MUST
WISH I HAD THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNING I ALMOST HIT SOMEONE WHILE MERGING OVER WAS INCHES AWAY FROM THE OTHER CAR ON THE FREEWAY IT HAPPENED LIKE 2 WEEKS AFTER I GOT MY CAR I KNOW NO MATTER WHAT YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE BLIND SPOTS BUT I WISH I HAD
BLIND SPOT CONTINUES TO BE PROBLEM EVEN WITH CIRCULAR ASSISTANCE ON MIRROR
REALLY LIKE THE BACKUP CAMERA AND SENSORS FAVORITE FEATURE IS THE SIDE ALERT SYSTEM WHEN BACKING UP IT IS VERY HELPFUL WHEN BACKING UP IN A PARKING LOT TO KNOW WHEN A CAR IS COMING IT HAS SAVED ME FROM AT LEAST ONE CLOSE CALL
WHEN THE CD PLAYER IS DOWN IT KIND OF BLOCKS THE VIEW OUT OF THE INSIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR
I BACKED INTO MY HUSBAND S NEW TRUCK WHEN COMING OUT OF MY GARAGE HE WAS PARKED TO THE SIDE AND I WAS JUST NOT USED TO THE CAMERA I DIDN T EVEN HAVE THE TEMPORARY LICENSE PLATE OFF MY VEHICLE YET I AM GETTING MORE USED TO THE CAMERA BUT I
WITHOUT LANE DEVIATION AND SIDE SENSORS THIS VEHICLE NEED S MORE GLASS
THE VEHICLE HAS A HUGE BLIND SPOT FOR THE DRIVER
REAR VISIBILITY MAYBE IS A LITTLE BIT REDUCED DUE TO THE TRUNK AND HATCH DESIGN BUT NOTHING MAJOR WE GET USED TO IT FAIRLY QUICKLY WHILE DRIVING
A REAR WINDOW WIPER WOULD HELP VISIBILITY IN RAIN SNOW
IT S VERY HARD TO SEE WHEN SWITCHING LANES TO THE RIGHT THE FRONT SEAT PASSENGER GETS IN THE WAY AND THERE IS A BIG BLIND SPOT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAR
THERE IS A LITTLE BLIND SPOT ANNOYANCE
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WITHOUT THE BACKUP CAMERA WHEN BACKING OUT OF PARKED SPACE
PILLERS CAUSE LARGE BLIND SPOTS WATCH OUT PEDESTRIANS HOW MANY PEDESTRIANS MUST DIE SO THE DRIVER CAN LIVE TO WIDEN AND BAD ANGLE TOO LIKE THE BACK
FAIRLY LARGE BLIND SPOTS
I NEED TO RELY ON MY SIDE MIRRORS FOR CHANGING LANES AND REAR CAMERA FOR BACKING UP A LOT MORE WITH THIS CAR
I ALREADY MENTIONED THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS BLINDSPOT ISSUES
WIDE SIDE POSTS LEAVE LARGE BLIND SPOT
MY VISIBILITY ISSUES ARE SKEWED BECAUSE I AM UNDER 5 FT TALL
BLIND SPOTS ON FRONT CORNERS
WHILE DRIVING OVER 45 MPH THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT WORK THAT WELL I THINK THEY ARE TOO LIGHT AND THEY DO NOT COMPLETELY WIPE THE AREA CLEAN OF WATER
BETTER BRIGHTER HEADLIGHTS THIS CAR SHOULD HAVE LED HEADLIGHTS AND TAILLIGHTS PERIOD THE HEADLIGHTS SHOULD BE AT LEAST 4500 LUMENS ON HIGH BEAM NOT THE LOW 1800 LUMENS THAT THE FACTORY HALOGENS ARE
ALL THE SUPPORT PILLARS A B C ARE VERY LARGE I LIKE THE SAFETY THAT PROVIDES TO THE VEHICLE BUT IT DOES OCCASIONALLY MAKE VISIBILITY MORE PROBLEMATIC THAN OTHER VEHICLES I HAVE DRIVEN
WHEN THE SUN VISOR IS LOWERED IT COVERS HALF OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE FOG LIGHTS ARE ALSO TRULY AMAZING
FIRST VEHICLE I VE HAD THAT I DO NOT HAVE A VISIBILITY PROBLEM
DRIVERS SIDE WIPE STOPS SHORT OF LEFT SIDE MAKING VISABILITY DISTORTED
THE BLIND SPOTS AREN T TERRIBLE BUT THEY RE NOT TOO GREAT EITHER IT MAKES ME BE EXTRA CAUTIOUS WHEN SWITCHING LANES
SUN VISORS ARE TO SMALL AND WOULD LIKE THE EXTENDERS ON THEM FOR BETTER PROTECTION FROM THE SUN ON THE SIDE WINDOWS HEAD RESTS IMPEDE THE VISIBILITY OF CARS IN YOUR RIGHT LANE WHEN WANTING TO CHANGE LANES
THE TRAX IS A PERFECT SIZED VEHICLE FOR ME IT SITS UP HIGHER THAN ECONOMY CARS MAKING VISIBILITY GREAT THE SIDE MIRRORS ALLOW FOR PERFECT VISIBILITY MAKING FREEWAY TRAVELING EASIER AND SAFER
REAR HEADREST SEEM TO SOMEWHAT BLOCK REAR VIEW OF DRIVER
OUTSIDE MIRRORS ARE SMALL SHOULD BE BIGGER THE BACK WINDOW IS SOMEWHAT NARROW VISIBILITY OUT BACK WINDOW IS AVERAGE
BLIND SPOT SYSTEM AND CROSS TRAFFIC WARNING IS A GREAT ADDITION ALSO FRONT AND REAR PARKING SENSORS ARE ALSO A WELCOME ADDITION
BLIND SPOTS ARE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO ADJUST MIRRORS FOR
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS ON THE DRIVERS SIDE AND PASSENGERS YOU CAN T ALWAYS SEE WHO IS BESIDE YOU WE INSTALLED A SMALLER MAGNIFIED MIRROR TO ATTACH TO THE EXTERIOR SIDE MIRRORS TO GET BETTER VISIBILITY MY LEAST FAVORITE THING ABOUT THIS CAR
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HID HEAD LIGHTS I THINK IT WOULD LOOK BETTER WITH THE LED MARKER LIGHTS AS WELL AS IMPROVED VISIBILITY
I NEED SPOT MIRRORS ON THE SIDE MIRRORS I HAVEN T DONE IT YET THE BLIND SPOT APPEARS TO BE PRETTY BIG
LOVE THE BACKUP CAMERA AND SENSORS
ONCE AGAIN THE NAVIGATION IN INSTUMENT CLUSTER IS VERY SAFE TO DRIVE WITH
PANELS ON BACK PASSENGERS SIDE WINDOWS MAKES FOR A BLIND SPOT AS THEY ARE RATHER THICK
I LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA I WISH THERE WAS ONE ON THE FRONT WHEN PARALLEL PARKING
TINTED WINDOWS WOULD HELP THOSE SITTING IN THE BACK SEATS FROM THE SUN
THERE ARE BAD BLIND SPOTS ON THIS CAR I HAVE TO TURN ALMOST ALL THE WAY AROUND IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE I CAN SAFELY CHANGE LANES
GREAT FORWARD AND REAR VISIBILITY REAR CAMERA
THE HEAD REST BLOCK REAR VISIBILITY IN SOME DIRECTIONS
BLIND SPOTS AT 1100 AND 200 DUE TO THE WIDE A POSTS
REAR VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT IS VERY LIMITED A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS
REAR VISIBILITY DIFFICULT WHEN CHANGING LANES
LIKE I SAID BEFORE THE LEFT HAND REAR VIEW MIRROR IS EITHER TOO BIG OR PLACED TOO HIGH FOR ME TO SEE REALLY WELL I AM ABOUT 5 TALL
REAR VIEW VISIBILITY VERY LIMITED
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE VERY SMALL SIZE OF THE REAR WINDOW VISIBILITY AND SAFETY ARE SOME OF THE BEST I VE SEEN IN AN SUV
BIG BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER YOUR RIGHT SHOULD TO CHANGE LANE TO THE RIGHT
TAKES SOME TIME TO GET USED TO THERE ARE A LOT OF BLIND SPOTS AND HARD TO SEE OVER THE FRONT HOOD BUT JUST NEED TO GET USED TO THE STYLE OF THE CAR REALLY NEED TO BE AWARE OF WHAT YOUR DOING WHEN BACKING UP
LOWER RATING FOR VISIBILITY OF OTHER VEHICLES WHEN CHANGING LANES BECAUSE OF LARGER BLIND SPOT BLIND SPOT DUE TO VEHICLE STYLING COMPENSATION FOR THIS IS PROVIDED BY MORE MORE FREQUENTLY CHECKING OF MIRRORS AND HIGHER AWARENESS OF TRAFFIC CONDIT
BLIND SPOT WITH THAT LITTLE SIDE MIRROR
REARVIEW CAMERA SOMETIMES DOES NOT COME ON WHEN IN REVERSE
THE REAR VIEW CAMERA IS AWESOME NOT ONLY DOES IT ALLOW ME TO AVOID HITTING A SMALL CHILD OR PET THAT WANDERS BEHIND THE VEHICLE BUT IT ALLOWS ME TO BACK UP VERY CLOSE TO AN OBJECT KNOWING THAT I WON T HIT IT I ACTUALLY WISH THERE WERE A FRONT
LARGER SUN VISORS BLIND SPOT MONITORS ON SIDE MIRRORS AUDIO ALARM WITH BACKUP CAMERA WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE INCONSISTENT ONE TIME THEY WORK PERFECTLY THE NEXT TIME THEY SCRAPE
THE DRIVER S SIDE WINDSHIELD PILLAR IS VERY THICK THIS RESULTS IN A MOVING BLIND SPOT WHEN TURNING LEFT
REAR RIGHT FROM DRIVER S RIGHT SHOULDER VIEW BLIND SPOT
WINDSHIELD DOOR POSTS GET IN THE WAY OF VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY DURING RIGHT HAND TURNS LEFT HAND TURNS ARE AT TIMES DIFFICULT DUE TO POST BLOCKING VIEW
REAR VIEW VERY LIMITED WITH REAR VIEW MIRROR
MAJOR BLIND SPOTS WHILE BACKING
MY TRAVERSE HAS THE BLIND SPOT MONITORING SYSTEM WHICH COULD BE USEFUL
WINDOWS ARE A LITTLE TOO STREAMLINE INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON VISIBILITY
THE RIGHT SEAT HIEGHT TRUCKS OVERALL HIEGHT VISIBILITY FROM ALL ANGLES MIRRIOR HIEGHT DOES NOT BLOCK VIEW FRONT HOOD IS SLOPED DOWN FOR A GOOD FORWARD VISIBILITY AND STYLE
LED OR HID LIGHTS WILD BE BETTER
WINDSHIELD WIPERS EVEN AFTER REPLACED CHATTERED CHEAP
VISIBILITY TO REAR AND SIDE OF VEHICLE DIFFICULT TO VISUALIZE
THE SUN VISORS WERE MADE SO SMALL THAT THEY ARE COMPLETELY USELESS NO BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
THE 5TH GENERATION CAMARO HAS A BAD BLIND SPOT ON THE BACK SIDES SO YOU ADJUST TO HOW YOU HAVE TO CHANGE LANES IT TAKES A LITTLE MORE EFFORT THAN MOST OTHER CARS BUT ONCE YOU DEVELOP YOUR NEW SYSTEM IT WORKS FAIRLY WELL THE BACK UP CAMERA I
LEFT FRONT DOORPOST IS IN AN AWKWARD LOCATION COMPROMISING FORWARD VISIBILITY
THE STEERING IS SURGICALLY PRECISE AND THE ACCELERATION IS SO QUICK IT HAS A SAFETY FACTOR TOO
IT SHOULD HAVE THE LANE DEPARTURE WARNINGS
BLIND SPOT IS A CONCERN
VISIBILTY IS A PROBLEM IN MANY NEW CARS MY 47 PLYMOUTH HAD GREAT VISIBILTY
IT S A SPORTS CAR NOT BOUGHT FOR VISIBILITY
OUTSIDE REAR VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE WIDER VIEW
I LOVE THE REAR BACK UP CAMERA
I WISH THERE WAS A FORWARD COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM
NO STANDARD BACK UP CAMERA
THERE IS A FAIRLY LARGE BLIND SPOT WHEN MY WIFE DRIVES THE CAR BECAUSE HER SEAT IS FURTHER UP THAN WHEN I DRIVE I HAVE NO BLIND SPOT ISSUES
A CAMERA SYSTEM THAT WOULD DISPLAY A FRONT VIEW AND A VEHICLE PERIPHERY VIEW WOULD BE A GREAT ASSET FOR PARKING AN INFRA RED OR RADAR LIKE SYSTEM WOULD BE GREAT TO ENHANCE NIGHT DRIVING SAFETY
BLIND SPOTS ARE MUCH WORSE WITH C 7
NICE REAR VIEW CAMERA
SIDE VISABILITY IS POOR
WISH THE FOG LIGHTS AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED IN THE PACKET
VERY HARD TO CHANGE LANES BECAUSE TO MANY BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOT ISSUES ALL CARS HAVE THEM THOU
LIMITED VISIBILITY TO THE REAR DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THE REAR WINDOW
REAR VIEW NOT THE BEST BECAUSE OF THE HEAD REST ON SEATS IN ROW TWO AND THREE
WISH IT HAD WARNING LIGHT WHEN ANOTHER CAR IN BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
HIGH BEAMS ARE AWEFULL AND 0 VISIBILITY FROM REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN REAR SEATS ARE OCUOPIED
DIDN T THINK WE WOULD USE THE BACK UP CAMERA THAT MUCH LOVE IT
SIDE VISIBILITY IS LACKING
FROM A SAFETY STANDPOINT LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU SIT UP HIGHER IN A MINIVAN THAN IN PASSENGER CARS ALSO LIKE THE VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS
DRIVERS SIDE REAR VIEW MIRROR HAS A BLIND SPOT WHEN A CAR IS PASSING CLOSELY
THE BLIND SPOT IS BAD HARD TO SEE TO CHANGE LANES
LANE DEPARTURE VERY USEFUL
THE HEADREST ON THE NON STOW N GO SECOND ROW SEAT SHOULD BE ADJUSTABLE I CURRENTLY STICKS UP TOO HIGH AND IMPACTS VISIBILITY OUT OF THE REA OF THE VEHICLE WHEN USING THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
REAR CAMERA OPTIO A MUST DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF REAR WINDOW WITHOUT CAMERA
HAD TO ADD THOSE LITTLE ROUND MIRRORS ON OUR MIRRORS DUE TO BLIND SPOT WAS ALLFUL
BLIND SPOT IS A MUST HAVE SHOULDN T BE AN OPTIONAL
HAVING JUST BEEN IN A ROLLOVER ACCIDENT WITH MY TOWN & COUNTRY I PURCHASED MY NEW T&C BASED ON IT S MANY SAFETY FEATURES THIS HAS EVEN MORE FEATURES THAN MY I FEEL VERY SAFE WITH THESE ADDED FEATURES
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS A GREAT FEATURE AS IS THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS GLAD I GOT THE MODEL THAT HAD THOSE
THE THIRD ROW HEAD RESTS BLOCK THE REAR PASSENGER SIDE VIEW WHEN BACKING VEHICLE INTO PARKING SPOT MUST HAVE HEAD RESTS IN DOWN POSITION WHICH IS THEN UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THIRD ROW PASSENGER ALSO PASSENGER SIDE WIPER BLADE ENDS IN THE MIDDLE O
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE VERY EFFECTIVE DURING HEAVY RAINS
I WOULD BE MORE NERVOUS CHANGING LANES DUE TO THE LARGE BLIND SPOT IF I DIDN T HAVE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATOR ON MY MIRRORS
WITHOUT THE REAR CAMERA AND AS SMALL AS THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO BACK UP RESPONSIBLY WITHOUT A SPOTTER
THE REVIEWS ARE ACCURATE THE BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGE
WOULD BE NICE FOR ALL CHALLENGERS TO HAVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITORS STANDARD
THE BLIND SPOT SENSORS ARE INVALUABLE BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH LIMITED VISIBILITY IN THE DRIVERS SEAT BEHIND YOU THEY ARE A LIFE SAVER AND I D LIKELY HAVE BEEN IN AN ACCIDENT WITHOUT THEM THEY SHOULD BE STANDARD ON THE VEHICLE
WHILE THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION SYSTEM IS GREAT I HAVE RECENTLY DRIVEN A VEHICLE THAT HAS A TWO PIECE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR THAT PROVIDED EXCELLENT VISIBILITY OF THE BLIND SPOT AREA THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE INCLUDED ON FUTURE CHARGERS
WOULD BE BETTER WITH LANE DEPARTURE ASSISTANCE
THE DESIGN OF THE VEHICLE IS WHAT IS ATTRACTIVE SO THE VISABILITY ITEMS ARE ANTICIPATED AND EXPECTED FOR WHAT THEY ARE
THE CHALLENGER HAS MANY SAFETY FEATURES WHICH DOES MAKE ME FEEL SAFE WHEN I AM DRIVING THE ONLY THING BAD IS THAT ONE BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE THE ADDED FEATURE IN THE MIRROR THAT LIGHTS UP IS A HUGE HELP
DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT THE PASSENGER SIDE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CAR BLIND SPOT AREA BECAUSE OF THE INNER COLUMN I HAVE ADJUSTED MY SIDE MIRROR TO ASSIST THIS CAR NEEDS THAT BACK UP CAMERA AND I LIKE THAT IT IS PLACED HIGHER UP ALLOWS MORE SIDE
VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR FROM ALL SIDES SEEING ON COMING VEHICLES
THE VISIBILITY IS SURPRISINGLY GOOD AND WHERE THERE IS A BLINDSPOT THEY MAKE UP FOR IT WITH DETECTION TOOLS
VISIBILITY WAS A HUGE PLUS FOR ME BEING ABLE TO SEE ALL AROUND FROM THE DRIVER SEAT WAS SOMETHING I WAS LOOKING FOR MINIMAL BLIND SPOTS
MORE REAR VISIBILITY
PERHAPS AN OPTION TO TURN ON THE REARVIEW CAMERA WHILE DRIVING
ITS HARD TO SEE BACK WHILE DRIVING AND THATS A BIG NEGATIVE ON THE CAR THE STYLING OF THE VEICHLE IS WHAT CAUSES THIS PROBLEM THE BLIN SPOT DETECTION AND THE BACK UP CAMERA WAS THE BEST SOLUTION POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE LOOK OF THE CAR IS JUST TRUE
BLIND SPOTS ARE LARGE BUT BLIND SPOT MONITORING IS AWESOME
DOES HAVE SOME BLIND SPOTS SUN VISORS ARE CUMBERSOME TO OPERATE
AUTO MATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS DO NOT ALWAYS COME ON WHEN EXPECTED
SIDE VISIBILITY COULD BE BETTER
PROJECTOR BEAM HEADLIGHTS ARE NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH ON HIGH BEAM THEY USE A HIR BULB THAT IS THE SAME WATTAGE ON HIGH OR LOW BEAM
I AM VERY HAPPY THAT COLLISION AVOIDANCE LANE DEPARTURE AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DRIVING AIDS ARE OPTIONAL ON THIS VEHICLE I HAVE NO INTEREST IN THESE FEATURES
VISIBILITY AND SAFETY IS GREAT SO FAR
DODGE HAS MADE HUGE IMPROVEMENTS IN VISIBILITY ON THE CHARGER IN COMPARISON TO MY OLD MODEL THE HEADLIGHT SYSTEM IS AMAZING THE BEAM IS INTENSE AND TARGETTED DOWN THE ROAD FOR EXCELLENT ILLUMINATION THE BEAM WIDENS WHEN IT SENSES A DARKER
WITH ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURE THIS VEHICLE HAS THERE S ABSOLUTELY NO BLIND SPOTS
IT S VERY DIFFICULT TO RATE EXCEPTIONAL OVER ANOTHER CAR FOR EFFECTIVENESS OF WIPERS SUN VISORS VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER SEAT YOU CAN EITHER SEE OR YOU CAN T IT DOESN T MEAN THAT I M NOT COMPLETELY SATISFIED WITH MY CHARGER I AM
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MY SUN VISORS AND HOW THEY SLIDE TO EXTEND OUT RATHER THAN JUST FLIP AND ROTATE I REALLY HELPS WHEN I MAKE MY MORNING DRIVES EAST AND AFTERNOON DRIVES WEST THERE IS HOWEVER A REALLY BAD BLIND SPOT AT THE DRIVER S 4 O CLOCK IF T
HEATED WINSHIELD FOR WIPER BLADES
REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR RELY HEAVILY ON MIRROR INDICATORS INDICATING VEHICLE IN BLIND SPOT
I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE SMALL TRIANGULAR WINDOWS IN THE BACK ON EITHER SIDE FOR USE WHEN I AM BACKING OUT OF PARKING SPACE THE EXTRA BIT OF VIEW IS GREATLY APPRECIATED
BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE CAN BE DIFFICULT
HEAD REST BLOCKS REAR VIEW VIEWING 2004 DURANGO HAS EXCELLENT OVER THE LEFT SHOULDER VIEWING
IT COULD USE BLINDSIDE MIRRORS IN THE MIRROR
I HAVE A FEW MORE BLIND SPOT ISSUES THAN I HAD WITH MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE I HAVE TO USE MORE CAUTION
I HAVE A BLIND SPOT BUT EVERYONE DOES THIS ONE SEEMS SMALLER THAN NORMAL
BAD OUTSIDE MIRRORS PLACEMENT BACK RIGHT HEADREST IN REAR VIEW MIRROR
POSITION AND SIZE OF GLASS AND MIRRORS MINIMIZES BLIND SPOTS IF SEATS AND MIRRORS ARE PROPERLY ADJUSTED
SOME POOR VISIBILITY WHEN CHECKING OVER MY SHOULDER
GOOD VISIBILTY
VISIBILITY FROM VEHICLE IS OF NO CONCERN I FEEL EXCEPTIONALLY SAFE IN MY CITADEL
HARD TO SEE BACK OF VEHICLE WITHOUT BACKUP CAMERA
BLIND SPOT AND AUTOMATIC HIGH BEAMS SHOULD BE STANDARD
BACK VISIBILITY IS BACK IF YOU RE TURNING YOUR HEAD TO PARK VIEW IS BLOCKED
THE ONLY SERIOUS COMPLAINT IS VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT AT 45 DEGREE ANGLES LEFT AND RIGHT THE LARGE WINDSHIELD FRAME SUPPORTS BLOCK VISIBILITY FROM THOSE ANGLES I HAVE ALMOST PULLED OUT IN FRONT OF TRAFFIC BECAUSE THE VIEW OF CROSS
AGAIN THERE ARE LARGER THAN USUAL BLIND SPOTS DUE TO SIZE OF BODY PIECES AT WINDOW AREAS BEHIND THE DRIVER
SUN VISORS NEED AN EXTEND RETRACT PIECE THAT GOES BEHIND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE WINDSHIELD WIPER DESIGN IS TERRIBLE SNOW AND ICE GET IN THE WELL AND THE WIPERS NEVER WORK PROPERLY WITHOUT STOPPING CONTINUALLY TO CLEAR THE DEBRIS OUT
THERE ARE HUGE BLIND SPOTS IN THE VEHICLE WISH WE D GOTTEN THE BLIND SPOT AVOIDANCE AND LANE DEPARTURE OPTION
WISH IT HAD BLIND SIDE MONITORING
MOST NEW VEHICLES WITH THE EXTRA AIRBAGS DO HAVE SOME VISIABILITY ISSUES BACK UP CAMERAS AND BLIND SPOT DETECTION ARE WONDERFUL
BLIND SPOTS ARE NOT EASILY VISIBLE FOR SOME WHO IS 5 1 LIKE MY SELF
WE HAD THE BACK UP CAMERA INSTALLED TO BOOST OUR SAFETY FEATURES SINCE WE HAVE 2 LITTLE ONES
DIDN T LIKE THE ADDITION OF BLACK PLASTIC SUN VISORS THAT WERE ADDED TO THE EXTERIOR OF ALL OF THE WINDOWS THE ONE ON THE DRIVER S SIDE SEVERELY LIMITED VISIBILITY ESPECIALLY ON LEFT CURVES HAD THE DEALER REMOVE THE VISOR STRIP ON THE DRIVER
IN SOME VEHICLES I VE DRIVEN THE A PILLAR IS INCONVENIENT AND GETS IN THE WAY THIS IS NOT THE CASE IN THE RAM AS I HAVE GREAT VISIBILITY LOOKING FORWARD AS WELL AS SIDE TO SIDE
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS ALL DIRECTIONS
AS I STATED ELSEWHERE THE REAR VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT IS TERRIBLE THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS RESTRICT THE VISIBILITY
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE TERRIBLE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER UPGRADING I HAD TO CHANGE THEM OUT THE FIRST WEEK I HAD THE TRUCK
I LOVE THIS TRUCK IT IS A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO SEE ALL ROUND AND GETTING USE TO AREAS THAT I NEED TO PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION LIKE BLIND SPOTS THE MIRRORS REALLY HELP A LOT
HAS MANY BLIND SPOTS
INSTEAD OF CAMERA FOR BACKING UP I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE CAMERA ON FOR WHEN CHANGING LANES FOR ADDED SECURITY
THIS IS AN AMAZING CAR HAS THE FEEL OF A LUXURY SUV IN A PACKAGE THAT COSTS $10K LESS THAN SIMILARLY EQUIPPED AND SIZED VEHICLES AMAZING JOB ON FIT FINISH SAFETY AND VALUE
WOULD LIKE A BACK UP CAMERA
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DODGE JOURNEY OFFERED WITH THE SAFETY FEATURES OF THE DURANGO ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL WITH STOP COLLISION WARNING ETC I AM NOT INTERESTED IN A VEHICLE THE SIZE OF THE DURANGO BUT WOULD LIKE THE ADDED BENEFITS THE DU
THE TOW MIRRORS ON THE HD TRUCKS ARE JUST NOT AS APPEALING OR AS EFFECTIVE AS FORDS HATE TO SAY IT BUT THEY GOT YOU BEAT THERE GO AHEAD AND JUST COPY THEM
SIDE SENSORS WITH AUDIBLE AND PHYSICAL PROMPTS OPTIONAL ON NEW GMC WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT ADDITION AS A STANDARD SAFETY FEATURE IN ADDITION AN EXTRA HAND GRIP FOR MY SHORT WIFE TO GRAB WHEN ENTERING THE PASSENGER SIDE WOULD BE NICE I LOVE MY T
REAR VISIBILITY NOT AS GOOD DUE TO HEIGHT OF TAILGATE
HEADLIGHT COULD BE BRIGHTER
THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS WORK WELL IN RAIN AND SNOW
I DONT LIKE THE LARGE BLIND SPOT AREAS ALONG THE SIDES
TALL TRUCK LONG TRUCK AND WIDE TRUCK LESS VISIBILITY
THERE IS NOTHING BAD ABOUT VEHICLE VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY
BLIND SPOT BEHIND DRIVER
THE POSITION OF THE PLUG IN NAVIGATION IS ANNOYING AND MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE FOCUS SOMETIMES
VISIBILITY OUT THE SECOND ROW SIDE WINDOWS COULD BE BETTER FOR SEEING INTO ADJACENT LANES
THE LITTLE INSET MIRROR IN THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR IS GREAT OVERALL VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS IS VERY GOOD THANKS TO GOOD MIRROR COVERAGE AND GENEROUS GLASS IT WOULD BE NICE IF OUTSIDE MIRRORS DIMMED AUTOMATICALLY HEADLIGHT PATTERN ON HI
THERE S A BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER SIDE WHICH IS UNPLEASANT
A COUPLE OF REAR BLIND SPOTS
THE DRIVER MIRROR IS NOT BIG ENOUGH AND MY BLIND SPOT IS BAD
BLIND SPOT RECOGNITIONS IS NON EXISTENT SUN VISORS ARE USELESS TOO SMALL
FIAT DID A GREAT JOB COVERING THE SOLE BLINDSPOT WITH A BLINDSPOT PORTION ON THE DRIVER S SIDEVIEW MIRROR
POOR VISIBILITY TO THE RIGHT AND LEFT REAR OF THE CAR
SOMETIMES I EXPERIENCE A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING BEHIND TO THE LEFT IN MY DRIVER SEAT
BLIND SPOT MIRROR DOES NOT PROVIDE ENOUGH VISIBILITY
I DIDN T LIST IT ON THE PREVIOUS SCREEN BUT THE NUMBER OF AIRBAGS FOR SUCH A SMALL CAR IS VERY IMPRESSIVE I FEEL THAT WERE I IN A COLLISION THEY WOULD FILL THE WHOLE CAR
I HAVE THE SPLIT MIRROR BUT I DID NOT REALIZE THE BLIND SPOT WAS SO BLIND I CHANGED LANES THINKING IT WAS CLEAR THEN NOTICED HOW CLOSE THE GUY IN MY MIRROR WAS I HAD CUT HIM OFF SCARED THE CRAP OUT OF ME
BLIND SPOT WHEN PULLING LEFT ON A TWO LANE ROAD OFF A SIDE ROAD SEATS IN THE FRONT ARE COMFORTABLE FOR TALL PEOPLE
THE SOUND FROM THE BACK UP SENSORS WOULD BE NICER IF IT WAS A LITTLE MORE PLEASANT
SOMETIMES WHEN TRYING TO SEE BEHIND IT IS DIFFICULT BUT REAR FACING CAMERA HELPS CHANGING LANES YOU HAVE TO PHYSICALLY TURN TO LEFT TO SEE THE LANE
EVERY POST PILLAR IS HUGE VISIBILITY IS HORRIBLE
I LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA BUT I FIND THAT WHEN I HAVE TO GO A LENGTHY DISTANCE IN REVERSE A LONG SLOPED CURVING DRIVEWAY IT IS NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO TURN AND LOOK OUT THE REAR WINDOW THE TALL SEATS MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
BLIND SPOT LOOKING TO RIGHT
THERE ARE SO MANY UNNECESSARY BLIND SPOTS
HEADRESTS TOO HIGH FOR VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR ARE REALLY BAD
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT
REAR DEFROST COULD DEFROST THE WHOLE REAR WINDOW A REAR WINDSHIELD WIPER WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE THE REAR WINDOW IS AT SUCH AN ANGLE THAT WATER AND DIRT SIT ON IT SIDE WINDOWS LOOK STYLISH BUT ARE A LITTLE SMALL
THE B PILLAR IS TOO THICK ON THE VEHICLE IT CREATES AN ABNORMALLY LARGE BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVER S REAR CORNER THAT COULD BE VERY DANGEROUS
THERE IS A BIT OF A BLIND SPOT OVER DRIVER S LEFT SHOULDER BUT I VE NEVER SEEN A CAR WHERE THERE WASN T
THE FRONT SUPPORT BEAMS AND REAR VIEW MIRROR HAVE BLOCKED SIGHT OF TRAFFIC COMING FROM THE RIGHT
THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL THE PANELS BETWEEN DOORS CREATES A BLIND SPOT
JUST DIFFICULT TO USE BACKUP CAMERA IN RAIN
WHEN THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS ARE UP VISIBILITY OUT THE BACK WINDOW IS VERY RESTRICTED
THE VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDO COULD BE MUCH BETTER AND THE WIPERS COULD COVER MORE WINDOW TERRITORY
REAR SENSORS OR CAMERA SHOULD COME STANDARD WITH THIS VEHICLE
LIKE EVERY OTHER VEHICLE I VE EVER DRIVEN I HATE THE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES
HEADRESTS BLOCK VIEWS OUT REAR SIDE WINDOWS AN REAR HEADRESTS BLOCK REAR VIEW MIRROR
BLIND SPOTS ARE TERRIBLE HAVE TO TURN AROUND EACH TIME I CHANGE LANES
GREAT VISIBILITY
THE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES IS REALLY BAD
LARGE BLIND SPOT ON RIGHT SIDE
THERE IS AN ISSUE OF WHEN YOU PUT DOWN THE DRIVER S SUN VISOR ALL THE WAY IT BLOCKS A PORTION OF THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THIS IS OVERCOME BY PUSHING FORWARD THE SUN VISOR TOWARD THE FRONT WINDOW HOWEVER THEN YOU MIGHT NOT BE BLOCKING OUT ALL OF
WISH HAD BLIND SPOT MONITORING LIKE MY OLD CX 5
REAR VIEW MIRROR ON WINDSHIELD IS LARGE AND MOUNTED SLIGHTLY LOW THERE IS A LARGER THAN DESIRED BLIND SPOT DUE TO THE LOW MOUNTING LOCATION AND SIZE OF THE MIRROR
IT IS HARD TO EXPLAIN BUT THE VISIBILITY SEEMS IMPAIRED BY THE B PILLAR
HUGE BLIND SPOTS IN THE REAR
ONE MAIN REASON I CHOOSE THIS VAN WAS THE ADDED SAFETY FEATURS
HARD TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW IF 3RD ROW SEAT HEAD REST ARE UP RECOMMEND BLIND SPOT MIRRORS
LOT S OF BLIND SPOTS IN THE VEHICLE
I WAS USE TO USING WINDOWS NOW I HAVE TO USE WINDOWS AND MIRRORS DO NOT LIKE THE BLIND SPOTS
OVERALL I LOVE MY 200 BUT I HAD TWO MAJOR ISSUES WITH IT 1 EVERY TIME I WASHED MY CAR DURING THE WINTER THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE SENSORS GO OFF LIKE CRAZY FOR NO APPARENT REASON OTHER THAN THEY ARE APPARENTLY FROZEN IT REALLY WRECKED MY ENJOYM
BLIND SPOTS ON DRIVERS SIDE MAKES IT REALLY HARD TO CHANGE LANES
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A DANGEROUS BLIND SPOT WHEN I GO TO SWITCH LANES
HEADRESTS BLOCK SIDE AND REAR VIEWS
I LOOK OVER SHOULDER TO BACK UP A VEHICLE IT IS QUITE A LEARNING CURVE USING A REAR VIEW CAMERA I AM HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME JUDGING DISTANCE EVEN WITH THE WARNING SYSTEM
THE FORD EXPLORER HAS GREAT VISIBILITY AND FEELS SAFE
THE VEHICLE IS LARGE BUT HANDLES LIKE A MIDSIZE CAR THE BULK AROUND YOU GIVES A GREAT SAFETY MARGIN IN EVENT OF AN ACCIDENT
LACK OF DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS FRONT AND TAILLIGHTS THESE SHOULD BE AUTO ON WHEN PULLING VEHICLE INTO DRIVE AT ALL TIMES
FINE BACKING UP WITH ASSISTED BACK UP NEED SOMETIMES WITH BLIND SPOTS
SINCE THEY HAVE MADE THE BACK WINDOW SMALLER SOME TROUBLE SEEING OUT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE THE BACK UP CAMERA
VISIBILITY THROUGH THE SIDE AND REAR WINDOWS WAS A DECIDING FACTOR IN OUR CHOOSING THIS VEHICLE WE FELT THIS MODEL WAS AMONG THE BEST WE TEST DROVE IN TERMS OF VISIBILITY TO THE FRONT REAR AND SIDES WHILE DRIVING
BEFORE WE PURCHASED A EXPLORER WE HAD A TOYOTA HIGHLANDER THE HIGHLANDER HAD EXCEPTIONAL VISIBILITY ALL AROUND THE VEHICLE
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS AWESOME
LIKE THE BLIS AND BACKUP CAMERA
IT IS A CHALLENGE TO PARK DUE TO LIMITED VISIBILITY IN THE FRONT
MIRRORS ARE TOO SMALL AND THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR BLENDS INTO OVERALL SIZE OF MIRROR SO YOU HAVE A HARD TIME ADJUSTING FOCUS ON PROPER MIRROR DANGEROUS BLIND SPOTS EVERYWHERE
HAVING DIFFICULTY ADJUSTING SIDE MIRROR TO SEE BLIND SPOT DO NOT FEEL THE ADDITIONAL MIRRORS IN THE SIDE MIRRORS ONLY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT WOULD NOT HAVE THOSE AGAIN
WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME SYSTEM TO KEEP BACKUP CAMERA LENS CLEAN
I WISH THAT THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM WAS STANDARD I THINK IF IT HAD OPTIONAL I WOULD HAVE PAID TO ADD IT
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT FEATURE THAT DISPLAYS ON SIDE MIRRORS VERY SAFE FEATURE FORWARD CAMERA ALSO VERY HELPFUL WHEN PARKING IN PARKING LOTS TO AVOID GETTING TO CLOSE TO CAR IN FRONT OR OTHER OBSTRUCTION
WITHOUT BLIND SIDE ASSISTANCE IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE LANES
REAR BLIND SPOT SENCORS SHOULD PICK THE VEHICLE UP EARLIER
I LOVE ALL OF THE SAFETY FEATURES ON MY NEW FORD TRUCK
I LOVE THE VISIBILITY AND SAFETY OF THIS TRUCK
THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA SHOULD STAY ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AFTER SHIFTING OUT OF REVERSE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO PARK
VISIBILITY FROM DRIVERS SEAT
THANK GOD FOR THE REARVIEW CAMERA SYSTEM IT IS INVALUABLE WHEN TRYING TO PARK THIS TRUCK
I REALLY LOVE THE BLIND SPOT INDICATORS AND THE BACK UP  PARK ASSIST CAMERA I DRIVE IN HOUSTON TRAFFIC AND THAT LITTLE INDICATOR LIGHT THAT LETS ME KNOW SOMEONE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT IS EXTREMELY USEFUL ESPECIALLY SINCE IT IS PLACED ON THE SIDE VI
IT IS HARD TO SEE OUT OF WHEN BACKING UP AND THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE NOT VERY GOOD FOR SEEING WHEN CHANGING LANES BLIND SPOTS
MORE VISIBILITY THAN I EXPECTED
WIPER BLADE DESIGN IS SUCH THAT WHEN USING WASHER FLUID WHILE DRIVING ABOVE 25 MPH THE BLADE RETAINS THE FLUID AND CONTINUES TO SPLATTER ON WINDSHIELD FORCING CONTINUOUS USE OF THE WIPERS TO CLEAR IT OFF
I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE REAR CAMERA
UNFORTUNATELY MOST LARGE TRUCKS SUFFER FROM THE SAME PROBLEM THEY HAVE LARGE THICK DOOR PILLARS THAT LEAD TO BLIND SPOTS IN THE FRONT AND BEHIND THE DRIVER THE LARGE MIRRORS DO A GREAT JOB OF OVERCOMING THE SIDE BLIND SPOTS BUT THE FRONT DOOR P
THE BLIND SPOT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM AND FORWARD VISIBILITY ARE EXCELLENT ON THIS VEHICLE
VISIBILITY IS BAD WHEN CHANGING LANE DUE TO VICHILE S HEIGHT GOOD THING IT HAS BLIND SPOT SYSTEM
VISIBILITY OF CHANGING LANES IS NOT THE BEST I MOSTLY RELY ON THE BLIND SPOT DETECTION
SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE GOOD FOR SEEING CARS IN BLIND SPOTS ONLY THING NOT TO LIKE IS THAT THEY HAVE TO BE RETRACTED TO GET INTO TIGHTER PLACES EG BANK DRIVE THRU
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS THEY RE A BLESSING WHEN DRIVING ON THE HIGHWAY
GREAT VISIBILITY AND EASY TO DRIVE SAFELY
WHEN THE FRONT HEADRESTS ARE TURNED AROUND BACKWARD AS THEY HAVE TO BE FOR ME TO DRIVE THIS CAR THEY REDUCE VISIBILITY IN THE PASSING LANE THAT S ANOTHER REASON TO REDESIGN THE HEAD RESTS HOWEVER FORD S LITTLE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE VERY N
ANNOYING BLIND SPOT
IT IS A SMALL CAR THAT WOULD BE CRUSHED IN A HEARTBEAT BY AN SUV SO FEELING OF SAFETY IS ALL RELATIVE I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS
THE STYLING OF THE ROOFLINE MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE MORE THAN 100 YARDS OR SO BEHIND THE VEHICLE SINCE THE TOP OF THE REAR WINDOW IS BELOW THE HORIZON FORWARD VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT BUT REARWARD VISIBILITY IS HINDERED BY THE SMALL REAR WIND
VERY GOOD VISIBILTY
REAR VIEW MIRROR GETS HIT BY SUN VISOR EVERY TIME I OPEN OR CLOSE IT
POOR SIDE AND REAR VISIBILITY DICTATED BY NHSTA REGULATIONS
THERE IS ONE BLIND SPOT THAT I HAVE NOTICED THAT IS IN A VERY SPECIFIC POSITION THAT ISN T SOMETHING I THINK PEOPLE WOULD RUN INTO OFTEN BUT I HAVE JUST ONE CROSS BACK STREET THAT I PASS THROUGH ENOUGH THAT I HAVE NOTICED WHEN YOU RE AT A STOP A
FEEL THAT THE FRONT VERTICAL BAR BETWEEN WINDSHIELD AND DOOR IS A BIT OF A BLINDSPOT THAT I AM TRYING TO GET USED TO
DRIVER S SIDE HAS A NASTY BLIND SPOT HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO USE THE BLIND SPOT MIRROR
DIFFICULT TO SEE OVER FENDER WHEN PULLING INTO PARKING SPOT
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE DOOR NEAR THE CORNER WHERE THE WIND SHIELD AND DRIVERS DOOR MEET THAT LITTLE WINDOW IN THE CORNER OF THE DRIVERS DOOR IS NOT GOOD
THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS THAT WERE BUILT IN ARE NOW GONE NOT ALL VEHICLES HAVE THE SENSORS
TOOK A FEW TEST DRIVES TO GET USED TO ONCE I KNEW WHERE MY BLIND SPOTS WERE I FELT A LOT MORE SAFE
SEEMS LIKE A SAFE AND SOLID CAR HID HEADLIGHTS ARE GREAT LIGHT UP THE ROAD AND THE HIGH BEAM FUNCTION IS VERY BRIGHT
IF THE VEHICLE HAD SOME OF THE COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURES THAT WOULD IMPROVE THINGS OTHERWISE THE VEHICLE HAS GOOD VISIBILITY
SEEING OUT THE BACK OR REAR SIDE OF THE VEHICLE IS DIFFICULT IT HAS A HUGE REAR BLIND SPOT
UNENCUMBERED VISIBILITY R
ALTHOUGH THERE IS NOT A LOT OF WINDOW SPACE IN THE VEHICLE BECAUSE IT IS SO SMALL YOU ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO SEE A LOT THE ONLY BIG CONCERN IS THE BLINDSPOTS ON THE SIDES BUT THE BLINDSPOT MONITOR PICKS UP THE VEHICLE BY YOU EVERYTIME
CRUISE CONTROL FEATURE ON STEERING WHEEL MAKES YOU TAKE EYE OFF ROAD TOO EASIL Y TOO MANY BUTTONS
BLIND SPOT ALERT SYSTEM IS GREAT
EVEN WITH THE CONVEXT MIRRORS BLIND SIDE IS NOT COVERED WELL
I LOVE THAT WHEN YOU ARE BACKING UP YOU HAVE THE SCREEN THAT SHOWS YOU EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE GOING I ALSO LOVE ON THE MIRRORS THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WINDOW THAT SHOWS YOU WHERE YOU CANNOT NORMALLY SEE SOMEONE COMING BEHIND YOU
TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES OR TRYING TO REVERSE
THE BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE VERY HELPFUL
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR ON THE PASSENGER SIDE BLOCKS THE VIEW OF CARS COMING FROM THE RIGHT AFTER STOPPING AT A STOP LIGHT SIGN I ALWAYS NEED TO LEAN FORWARD AND BACK TO MAKE SURE NO CAR IS COMING
I LOVE MY REAR VIEW CAMERA & THE TINY SIDE MIRRORS THAT LET ME SEE THE CARS IN MY BLIND SPOT
AS ANY CONVERTABLE WHEN THE TOP IS UP THE BLIND SPOTS WHILE BACKING UP
COLLISION AVOIDANCE MIRRORS GO ON WHEN ANOTHER VEHICLE IS CLOSE TO YOU ON A MULTI LANE HIGHWAY
I WISH MY TAURUS HAD THE DOUBLE SUN VISORS LIKE MY 2002 SABLE HAD THIS GAVE SIDE WINDOW AS WELL AS WINDSHIELD VISOR PROTECTION TAURUS HAS SOME BLIND SPOTS
THE SIDE WINDOWS OF THE BACK SEAT ARE TOO SMALL TO BE OF MUCH USE BUT THAT S OK BECAUSE I KNEW THAT WHEN I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE THE OUTSIDE MIRRORS HELP TREMENDOUSLY MY FAVORITE FEATURE THOUGH IS THE REAR VIEW CAMERA I WONDER HOW I GOT ALONG
VISIBILITY OUT OF REAR WINDOW FROM DRIVERS SEAT IS LIMITED
THE VISIBILITY IN BLIND SPOT IS THE SAME ON ALL THESE MODELS A LITTLE HARD BUT NOT A PROBLEM THE LITTLE EXTRA MIRRORS ATTACHED TO SIDE MIRRORS ARE A BIG IMPROVEMENT TO THIS ISSUE
WITHOUT BLIND SPOT ELECTRONIC ASSIST FROM THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS IT WOULD BE AVERAGE AT BEST TO CHECK FOR CARS IN OTHER LANES BEFORE SWITCHING LANES OR TURNING
THE HEIGHT OF THE PASSENGER HEAD REST MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SEE WHILE LOOKING TO THE REAR IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE THE HEAD REST FULLY EXTENDED TO AVOID HAVING A BLIND SPOT
BLIND SPOT MIRRORS ARE A GREAT ADDITION TO THE SIDE MIRRORS
THE CAR IS EQUIPPED WITH BLIND SPOT MIRRORS PLACED INTO THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS SO IT HELPS SIGNIFICANTLY STILL HAVE TO LOOK OVER THE SHOULDER AT TIMES WHILE MERGING LANES
I DON T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITHOUT THE BACKUP CAMERA VISIBILITY IS TERRIBLE FROM BACK WINDOW
LOVE THE VISIBILITY IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THE DRIVING HANDING AND RESPONSIVENESS REAR WIPERS ARE EXCEPTIONAL LOVE IT
BACK UP CAMERA IS FABULOUS
INDICATOR THAT ANOTHER CAR IS IN THE BLIND SPOT IS A GREAT FEATURE
I BOUGHT THE PREMIUM PACKAGE IT SHOULD HAVE ALL THE TRICK ELECTRONIC DEVICES THAT HELP AVOID COLLISIONS BUT IT DOESNT
SIDE AND REAR VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR FROM THIS VEHICLE
NO FOG LIGHT HEADLIGHT IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH
THE A PILLARS ARE LARGE AND BLOCK A LOT OF VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY IS NOT SO BAD FOR ME A 6 FOOT MALE HOWEVER MY WIFE IS 5 FOOT AND STRUGGLES TO SEE OUT EVEN WITH SEAT HIGH
SERIOUS BLIND SPOT IN A
REAR VIEW MIRROR TOO FAR FROM DRIVER VISORS LACK LIGHT SIDE MIRROR ADJUSTMENT TRICKY FORD EDGE EASIER SMALL SIZE AND LAYOUT OF DRIVER INSTRUMENT COCKPIT DISPLAY
FRONT AND SIDE VISIBILITY REALLY GREAT BUT VIEW TO RIGHT REAR IS NOT GOOD 2ND ROW HEADRESTS SHOULD FOLD DOWN TO HELP THAT
SIDE VIEW MIRROR DIVISIONS FOR DISTANCE AND CLOSE UP COMPENSATES FOR THE POOR VISIBILITY AREAS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE
BLIND SPOT MIRRORS SHOULD BE A STANDARD FEATURE
REAR VISIBILITY IS TERRIBLE WHEN LOOKING BACK CORNER POST IN FRONT MAKE VISIBILITY BAD WHEN LOOKING AT CROSS TRAFFIC
IT IS A BIG VEHICLE WITHOUT FEELING LIKE IT IS A BIG VEHICLE I LOVE THAT THE SIDE MIRRORS ARE LOW AND SMALL YET EFFECTIVE IT ELIMINATES A LARGE BLIND SPOT THAT I HAD WITH MY OLD VEHICLE
HAD A ESCALD I M USED TO BETTER REAR VISIBILITY
THERE ARE SOME BLIND SPOTS ON THE SIDES OF THE VEHICLE
INSTALLING AUTOMATIC WINDSHIELD WIPERS WOULD BE A DEFINITE PLUS FOR THIS VEHICLE
IT S VERY HARD TO SEE WHEN CHANGING LANES I FEEL LIKE THE SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD HAVE AN EXTRA SMALL MIRROR FOR THE BLIND SPOT AREA
REAR BACK UP CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD ALONG WITH BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECT
ALL THIS VEHICLES NEEDS BACK UP CAMERA
IT S HARD TO SEE IN YOUR BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER WHEN I M WAITING TO MAKE A RIGHT HAND TURN I HAVE TO LEAN WAY FORWARD TO SEE IF CARS ARE COMING
HARD TO SEE WHEN BACKING UP NO FAULT OF THE VAN JUST HAS BLIND SPOT BACK DRIVERSIDE DOOR
BECAUSE OF HOW THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK SITS LOWER THEN THE BACK YOU SEE MORE THEN I WOULD LIKE OF THE TAIL GATE IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR
THE DRIVERS WINDSHIELD WIPER SEEMS TO LEAVE A STREAK OF WATER IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER WHEN IT WIPES DOWN ALSO AS NOTED THE VEHICLE SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT MONITORS AND BACKUP SENSORS ALSO WHY IS THERE A BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON THE DRIVER SIDE BUT
NEEDS BLIND SPOT MIRROR ON PASSENGER SIDE
REAR WINDOW WIPER NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
I M GLAD I HAVE A BACK UP CAMERA BECAUSE THE BACK WINDOW IS SO HIGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT S BEHIND YOU
VEHICLE IS LARGE ENOUGH TO OFFER COMFORT AND SAFETY
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT BUT IT IS COMPENSATED BY THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRROR
EXCELLENT BACK UP CAMERA AND BACKUP COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM
THE BACKUP CAMERA IS SUPER
CHOSE THE C MAX BECAUSE IT RIDES A BIT HIGHER THAN A PASSENGER CAR BUT STILL HAS THE FEEL AND COMFORT OF A PASSENGER CAR MY LAST VEHICLE WAS A FORD ESCAPE AND FEEL THE C MAX PROVIDED THE ROAD VISIBILITY OF THE ESCAPE WITH THE COMFORT OF A PASSEN
REAR AND REAR SIDE VISIBILITY ON MOST NEW CARS IS VERY POOR C MAX ISN T THE WORST BUT WOULD LIKE IT TO BE BETTER BLIND SPOTS ON THE 4 CORNERS COULD BE IMPROVED
BAD VISIBILITY BACKING OUT OF ANGLE PARKING PLACE
I LIKE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AUTOMATIC WIPERS ALSO THE BLIND SPOT SIDE MIRRORS WORK VERY WELL SUN VISORS NEED TO COVER MORE WINDOW DOWN AND BACK WHEN TURNED TO SIDE WINDOW
THE REAR BACKUP CAMERA NEEDS TO BE CLEANED OFF OFTEN CAN GET HAZY BLURRY
SOME BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES SUN VISORS DON T COVER ENOUGH OF WINDSHIELD
THE CURVE OF THE WINDSHIELD MAKES THE DRIVER SIDE WINDSHIELD WIPER COVER LESS AREA AND LEAVES A GAP ALONG THE LEFT EDGE ALSO THE WASHER SPRAY IS INEFFECTIVE WHILE THE CAR IS IN MOTION BECAUSE THE AERODYNAMICS SENDS THE FLUID TOWARD THE ROOF
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS ENORMOUS IT IS RAKED AT AN ANGLE THAT INCREASES THE VEHICLE S AERODYNAMICS AND PROVIDES TREMENDOUS VISIBILITY THE SIDE MIRRORS HAVE BUILT IN CONVEX MIRRORS ON THE EDGES OF THE LARGER MIRRORS THEY INCREASE VISIBILITY T
VISIBILITY IS GREAT LARGE MIRRORS WITH INSET ADJUSTABLE REAR HEADRESTS REAR WINDOW SIZE
I WISH THE CAR HAD HIGHER END SAFETY EQUIPMENT LIKE BLISS AND ADAPTIVE CRUISE CONTROL
HEADLIGHT ARE AMONG THE BEST I EVER SEEN
COULD HAVE A BROADER HEADLIGHT RANGE
I WOULD LIKED TO HAVE HAD BLIND SPOT WARNING RADAR CONTROLLED CRUIS CONTROL HEADS UP DISPLAY
SOMETIME YOU HAVE BLIND SPOT FROM ROOF SUPPORTS
LOOKING BACK TO REVERSE THE CAR THERE IS ALWAYS SOME BLIND SPOTS AT THE REAR PILLAR THE REAR VIEW CAMERA HELPS CONFIRM THAT ALL IS CLEAR BUT I AM STILL GETTING USED TO OPERATING WITH THE REAR CAMERA AND YET STILL NEEDING TO LOOK BACK AS WELL I
THE REAR SIDE VISIBILITY ON THE DRIVER S SIDE IS NON EXISTENT I M CERTAIN THAT S WHY THEY PUT A BUILT IN FISH EYE MIRROR IN THE DRIVER S SIDE MIRROR
THERE ARE REMARKABLE BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY ON THE LEFT SIDE FOR SUCH A SMALL CAR IT IS REMARKABLY DIFFICULT TO BACK INTO SPOTS GIVEN THE BLIND SPOTS FROM THE C PILLARS
MUCH BETTER VISIBILITY THAN ANY OTHER CAR I VE EVER DRIVEN
THE SIDE MIRRORS HAVE A ENLARGING MIRROR IN THE CORNER WHICH IS HARD TO GET USED TO THAT CORNER LET ME KNOW IF THERE WAS A CAR IN THE BLIND SPOT NOW I HAVE TO REFOCUS TO SEE A LARGER IMAGE NOT WHAT I AM USED TO AND HAS ME VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT
BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING
AGAIN I M TALL 6 4 AND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR IS RIGHT IN MY LINE OF SIGHT AT A 4 WAY STOP THE CAR ON THE RIGHT WILL BE ALMOST COMPLETELY HIDDEN BEHIND THE REAR VIEW MIRROR THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OPTION TO MOVE IT UP 3
THE VISIBILITY AND ESPECIALLY THE TILT OF THE WINDSHIELD ARE OPTIMAL
I HAVE DRIVEN LARGE SUVS FOR MANY YEARS AND HAVE FOUND THE LARGE BLIND SPOTS A PROBLEM BUT WITH THE MANY TECHNOLOGY WARNINGS ON THE EXPEDITION I FIND THE LARGE BLIND SPOTS HAVE BEEN DIMINISHED BY A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE
I FEEL THAT THE FORD EXPEDITION IS THE BEST VEHICLE OUT THERE FOR SAFETY AND VISIBILITY ALSO IT IS EXCEPTIONAL FOR TOWING A TRAILER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NOT HAVING TOWING MIRRORS
EVEN WITH BLIND SPOT ASSISTANCE I STILL PREFER TO CHECK FOR MYSELF BEFORE CHANGING LANES SOMETIMES THE SECOND ROW HEADREST IS IN MY FIELD OF VISION
THE NEW BLIND SPOT SAFETY FEATURE IS A WONDERFUL NEW ADDITION
IT IS OVERALL A GOOD VEHICLE FOR VISIBILITY CONSIDERING THE LIMITATIONS OF A LARGE SUV
I CANNOT SEE THE FRONT END OF THE CAR AS FRONT PARKING SENSORS WERE NOT AN OPTION I HAD THEM INSTALLED AFTER MARKET SO I CAN PARK IN TIGHT CITY SPOTS
BLIND SPOT WARNING LIGHT ON DOOR MIRRORS A GOOD FEATURE
HEADLIGHTS COULD BE AIMED A LITTLE HIGHER ON LOW BEAMS VISIBILITY DISTANCE IS LIMITED
VEHICLE IS HIGH ENOUGH ENABLING GREAT VISIBILITY
I LIKE THE BACK UP CAMERA FEATURE ALTO I USUALLY USE MY MIRRORS
SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN STOPPED AND TRYING TO LOOK FOR ONCOMING TRAFFIC THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW & FRONT GLASS THE PART THAT DIVIDES THE FRONT GLASS & PASSENGER WINDOW CAUSES A BLIND SPOT IN SOME SITUATIONS THIS OCCURS FREQUENTLY WHE
WOULD LIKE THE BACKUP CAMERA DISPLAY TO TURN AS CAR TURNS TO SHOW PATH CAR WILL GO ALSO A SCALE DISPLAYED TO SHOW DISTANCE IN INCHES TO OBSTRUCTION IN REVERSE DISPLAY
GREAT VISIBILTY
I AM FAIRLY SHORT 5 2 5 AND MY VISIBILITY IS GREAT HEIGHT OF VEHICLE IS GREAT REAR CAMERA IS GREAT FEATURE
REAR VISIBILITY WHEN NIGHT DRIVING WHEN HEADLIGHTS FROM CARS IN BACK OF MY CAR I FEEL THE OTHER CARS HEADLIGHTS ARE SHADED NOT GIVING ME A TRUE SENSE OF HOW FAR IN BACK THEY ARE ESPECIALLY ON A BUSY INTERSTATE AT NIGHT DO NOT FEEL 100% WHE
LOVE THE LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM
SLIGHT BLIND SPOT IN REAR PASSENGER SIDE
REAR WIPER PERFORMANCE IS MINIMAL
REAR VISIBILITY IS A PROBLEM THE CAMERA SYSTEM HELPS BUT CAN BE MISLEADING
I LOVE THE NEAR PERFECT AUTONAMOUS DRIVING ABILITY FOR UP TO 15 SECONDS PLEASE MAKE THIS CAR SELF DRIVING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BEYOND 15 SECONDS THIS IS THE GREATEST TECHNOLOGY NO HANDS DRIVING THE SOONER THE BETTER ONE BIG REASON I PUR
WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY I FEEL LIKE I AM SEATING IN A BUNKER WHEN DRIVING MY ML WHEN I TRAVEL IN ANOTHER MANUFACTURER BRAND OTHER THAN MERCEDES I AM ALWAYS NERVOUS LOL
OBSERVATION�WHEN THE PASSENGER SEAT IS AT OTHER THAN 90 DEGREES AND PUSHED BACK VERY LITTLE OF THE 2ND ROW WINDOW IS VISIBLE SHOULD THE DRIVER NEED TO SEE OUT
REAR VISIBILITY COULD BE SLIGHTLY BETTER
CRUISE CONTROL IS EXCEPTIONAL
THE HEADS UP PROJECTION OF VEHICLE S SPEED AND NAVIGATION ON THE WINDSHIELD SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT
VERY POOR REAR VıSıBıLıTY BACK UP CAMERA MUST
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE THE BEST EVER THEY RE QUIET AND GIVE EXCELLENT COVERAGE
THE NIGHT VISION IS SUPER HELPFUL
EVEN THOUGH I AM 6 4 I AM ABLE TO SEE OUT OF THE VEHICLE VERY WELL MANY CARS DO NOT PROVIDE ME WITH ENOUGH VISIBILITY EVEN THOUGH I FIT IN THE SEAT FINE
THE WINDSHIELD WASHERS DO NOT WET THE WINDSHIELD UNTIL THE WIPERS HAVE MADE ONE OR TWO DRY SWIPES I CAN SEE THE DUST FLY OFF THE WINDOW THIS WILL SCRATCH THE GLASS OVER TIME OBSCURING GOOD VISIBILITY OUR WOULD SPRAY THE WINDOW BEFORE
YOU CANNOT TURN OFF THE AUTO DIMMING FEATURE FOR THE HIGH BEAMS AND IT WILL NEVER ALLOW THEM TO GO ON SO IT IS LIKE NOT HAVING HIGH BEAMS THIS IS A SERVIOUS SAFETY ISSUE ALSO I STRONGLY DISLIKE THE FEATURE THAT PLACES THE CAR IN PARK WHEN THE DR
LANE CHANGE WARNING IS GOOD
WISH WE WOULD HAVE ORDERED THE LANE ASSIST FEATURES DUE TO BLIND SPOTS
THIS CAR HAS THE MOST SAFETY TECHNOLOGY AND FEATURES OF ANY CAR I HAVE OWNED
THERE IS A SMALL GAP ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DRIVER S SUN VISOR THAT LET S LIGHT IN AT TIME THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS HAVE AN AMAZING BUILT IN FLUID SYSTEM THAT DELIVERS THE FLUID DIRECTLY TO THE GLASS INSTEAD OF SPRAYING IT ALL OVER
BLIND SPOTS WHEN BACKING OR CHANGING LANES TOWARD REAR QUARTERS THE HEAD RESTS ARE IN THE WAY
BLIND SPOTS IN THIS CAR IS BEYOND RIDICULOUS BLIND SPOT ASSIST SHOULD COME FREE WITH ALL MERCEDES BENZ CLA CLASS
LED HEADLIGHT ARE PHENOMINAL
IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE A REAR BACKUP CAMERA
SOME BLIND SPOTS FOR MY 5 FOOT TALL WIFE
THIS CAR HANDLES ADVERSE ROAD CONDITIONS IN INCLEMENT WEATHER LIKES NOTHING WE VE EVER EXPERIENCED IT IMPARTS SUCH A FEELING OF QUIET SECURE SAFETY AND CONTROL AT ALL TIMES THAT WE LL BE HARD PRESSED TO EVER SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS IN THE FUTU
THERE ARE SOME TOUGH BLIND SPOTS WHICH IS MY ONLY COMPLAINT ABOUT THE ENTIRE VEHICLE I HAVE GOTTEN USED TO THOSE BLIND SPOTS AND AM NOW COMFORTABLE BUT I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THE REAR VIEW CAMERA
VISIBILITY IS HINDERED DUE TO THE THICK WINDSHIELD AND B PILLAR SAFE LANE CHANGES REQUIRE A CAREFUL LOOK AND ARE DIFFICULT IN HEAVY TRAFFIC REARWARD VISIBILITY IS OK FOR ASSESSING TRAFFIC THE DECKLID CANNOT BE SEEN AT ALL THROUGH THE REAR W
VEHICLE HAS BLIND SPOTS
FEWER VISIBLE CONTROLS MIGHT BE NICE THERE IS UNNECESSARY REDUNDANCY CLUTTERING THE VISUAL SPACE
EITHER SIDE BAR NEEDS TO BE NARROWED OR BLIND SPOT INDICATOR SHOULD BE STANDARD OPTION
THERE IS SOMEWHAT OF A BLIND SPOT IN THE DRIVERS SIDE ALSO THE SUN VISORS SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PULL DOWN IN ADDITION TO THE VISOR ITSELF AS IT JUST DOES NOT KEEP THE SUN OUT OF MY EYES DOES NOT SEEM BIG ENOUGH
WISH THE BLIND SPOT NOTIFICATION WAS STANDARD SO I WOULD HAVE BETTER VISIBILITY WHEN SWITCHING LANDS
VERY BAD BLIND SPOT ON DIVERS SIDE
REALLY GOOD VISIBILITY OUT OF THE CAR
THE CAR HAS SIDE REAR BLIND SPOTS WHICH REQUIRES SEVERAL INSPECTIONS BEFORE CHANGING LANES
WITH THE CONVERTIBLE TOP THERE IS SOME LOSS OF REAR VISIBILITY BUT THAT IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A CONVERTIBLE
BEAM BETWEEN DRIVER DOOR AND REAR PASSENGER DOOR REDUCES FULL VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES
LOVE THE RAIN SENSING WIPERS ESPECIALLY LIVING IN SEATTLE
EVEN MY WIFE HAS INDICATED SHE HAS NO BLIND SPOTS IN OUR MINI
BLIND SPOTS IN REAR CORNERS
IT NEEDS A SIDE CAMERA TO CHANGE LANES AND ONE IN THE FRONT FOR PARKING WOULDN T BE A BAD IDEA
THERE ARE MORE BLIND SPOTS THAN MY PREVIOUS MINI HAD
I PREVIOUSLY HAD A MINI COOPER AND THIS MODEL DOESN T HAVE THE BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING TO CHANGE LANES TO THE LEFT
I D LOVE A FULLY GLASS ROOF AND PERHAPS A SLIGHTLY EASIER REAR VIEW ON BLIND SPOTS
WOULD LIKE THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS ON THE DOORS TO PROVIDE A WIDER VIEW OF THE BACK OF THE CAR THE LEFT DOOR MIRROR DOES NOT SWIVEL AS FAR TO THE LEFT TO GIVE ME A COMFORTABLE VIEW OF WHAT S COMING BEHIND ON MY LEFT SIDE I HAVE TO LEAN FORWARD
REAR SIDES BLIND SPOT DUE TO SOFTTOP ROOF PILLARS BEING TOO WIDE
SUNVISORS CONTINUE TO BE TOO NARROW TO ACTUALLY COVER THE SUN AT SUNDOWN HARD TO ESCAPE THE GLARE AT THIS TIME OF THE DAY WHEN DRIVING POTENETIAL SAFETY ISSUE
LESS BLIND SPOTS THAN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE BMW X3
SMALL REAR VIEW MIRROR NEED FISH EYE
NEEDS WIPER BLADES WITH HEAT ICE BUILDUP ON BLADES UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS
SIDE AND SIDE REAR VISIBILITY OUT OF THE CAR IS VERY POOR LANE CHANGE INDICATOR SHOULD BE STANDARD I WISH I HAD IT DOOR POSTS AND HEAD RESTS BLOCK SIDE VISION
MANY BLIND SPOTS SO WE NEED TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHEN CHANGING LANES
BLIND SPOT IS SIGNIFICANT IN THIS CAR
THE WIPER FLUID DOES NOT DISPENSE EVENLY ACROSS THE WINDSHIELD SO WHEN DRIVING IN SNOW   SLUSHY CONDITIONS ABILITY TO KEEP THE DRIVER SIDE WINDSHIELD CLEAN FOR VISABILITY WAS DIFFICULT THIS WINTER THE WIPER BLADES ALSO DID NOT DO WELL IN COLDE
THE HEADLIGHTS DON T SEEM TO ILLUMINATE AS WELL AS I FEEL THEY SHOULD AND THE SIDE PANELS FOR THE FRONT GLASS CREATE A BLIND SPOT
IN THIS DAY AN AGE ALL CARS SHOULD BE EQUIPED WITH SAFETY FEATURES WHEN CHANGING LANES AND REARVIEW CAMERAS AT NOT EXTRA COST
THE PLACEMENT OF THE VISORS ALONG WITH A LACK OF ABILITY TO ADJUST SEAT HEIGHT GIVE LIMITED FRONT WINDSHIELD VISIBILITY & FEELING OF CRAMPED SPACE & LESS SAFETY VISOR IS HORRIBLE NOT LONG ENOUGH USELESS ON THE SIDE WINDOW
GREAT VISIBILITY AND OVERALL FEELING THAT THE CAR HAS WEIGHT AND STABILITY
VERY LITTLE TO NO BLIND SPOTS FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT YOU DONT HAVE TO TURN YOUR HEAD COMPLETELY TO CHECK FOR YOUR BLIND SPOTS DUE TO WHERE THEY POSITIONED THE WINDOWS AND THE SMALL TRIANGULAR WINDOW FOR THAT EXTRA COMFORT TO SEE ALL ALONG THE RIGHT
IT S A ROADSTER SO YOU HAVE TO EXPECT THIS BUT THE REAR VISIBILITY ISN T GREAT
PASSENGER WIPER BLADE DOESN T CLEAN UNLESS COMPLETELY WET LANCER WAS SAME WAY
THE CAR IS COMFORTABLE AND EASY TO SEE OUT OF NO BLIND SPOTS FOR ME I FEEL SAFE
VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY ARE EXCELLENT
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHEN BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPACE AS I LOOK BACK INTO TRAFFIC THE SEAT HEAD REST IS IN MY WAY AND IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT
DEFINITE BLIND SPOTS
THE FRONT HEAD REST BLOCKS VISIBILITY TO EASILY LOOK OUT BACK
THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ABOVE AVERAGE BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES LEFTWARD THE SUN VISORS ARE TOO SHORT AND NOT HELPFUL AS THE SUN SETS WHEN YOU NEED THEM THE MOST
HEADLIGHTS COULD BE BRIGHTER WHEN CHANGING LANES BLIND SPOT RECOGNITION ENHANCER OF SOME SORT COULD BE HELPFUL
WHEN SOFT TOP IS UP THERE IS A MAJOR BLIND SPOT TO THE REAR LEFT AND RIGHT YOU REALLY HAVE TO MOVE YOUR HEAD AROUND AND DOUBLE CHECK WHEN BACKING UP AND CHANGING LANES
NEED TO INTRODUCE CONVEX MIRRORS TO STANDARD REARVIEW MIRRORS FOR BETTER VISION TO PASSING VEHICLES
FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE NOT GREAT THEY FREEZE AND BECOME INAFFECTIVE HAVE TO GO OUT AND RESET THEM AND THAW THEM OUT AND SOMETIOME THEY STILL DON T SWIPE A CLEAN PATCH ON THE WONDSHIELD
AT TIMES THE SUN VISORS ARE WHOLLY INADEQUATE THEY NEED TO BE LONGER OR HAVE EXTENSIONS THE CAR SHOULD HAVE BLIND SPOT DETECTION I LIKED THE VEHICLE A LOT OVERALL BUT FELT THAT I HAD TO REPLACE IT WITH A SECOND VEHICLE WITH ALL WHEEL CONTROL
LOVE THE REVIEW CAMERA
THE REAR WIPER DOES NOT CLEAR A LARGE AREA
BLIND SIDE COULD BE BETTER
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD GETS DIRTY FAST SO YOU NEED TO US ALOT OF WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID
BLIND SPOTS WITH NO CONVEX MIRRORS
THE BUILD QUALITY OF THE CAR IS EXCEPTIONAL AND CONVEYS A FEELING OF SAFETY
LIMITED VISIBILITY OUT BACK WINDOW BUT NOT TO A POINT OF BEING UNSAFE
SPOILER IN BACK IS TOO HIGH AND BLOCKS VISIBILITY MAKES CHANGING LANES UNSAFE SUN VISOR IS TOO SHORT AND DOES NOT HELP MUCH FROM THE BACK SIDE
BLIND SPOT FOR ME DRIVING WHERE FRONT WINDSHIELD AND SIDE WINDOW
LANE DEPARTURE WAS DETECTING VEHICLES 2 LANES OVER THE COLLISION SENSOR WAS GOING OFF WHEN NOTHING WAS AROUND ME BOTH FRONT AND REAR
THE VEHICLE IS LARGER THAN THE FORD EXPLORE WE PREVIOUSLY OWNED AND FOR ME IT DIFFICULT TO TELL HOW FAR AWAY FROM THE CURB YOU ARE WHEN PARALLEL PARKING ON THE PASSENGER SIDE I WAS TRYING TO BE VERY CAREFUL AN STILL CURBED THE RIM AND SCRATCHED IT
SIDE MIRRORS SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY LARGER FOR WIDER RANGE VISIBILITY
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS MAKE A STUTTERING NOISE WHEN RUNNING DURING A RAINSTORM
ONE OF THE REASONS I CHOSE THE GLK WAS THE VISIBILITY I FEEL IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE FOR THIS TYPE OF VEHICLE SO MANY SUV S BOTH SMALL AND LARGE HAVE MADE THE WINDOWS FAR TOO SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO SEE OUT OF THE GLK STILL HAS
THE BRAND SHOULD PROVIDE MORE SAFETY FEATURES AS STANDARD EQUIPMENT SUCH AS REAR VIEW CAMERAS LANE CHANGE WARNING SYSTEM AND EMERGENCY BRAKING
THE WIPER BLADES WHEN IN OPERATION THE PASSENGER SIDE WIPER BLADE STOPS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DRIVER S FIELD OF VIEW EXTREMELY DISTRACTING
ASIDE FROM VEHICLE SIZE VISIBILITY WAS A MAJOR FACTOR IN SELECTING THIS VEHICLE WE ARE APPROACHING 70 YEARS OF AGE AND FEEL WE NEED ALL THE VISUAL AND TECHNOLOGY FEATURES AVAILABLE THE BACK UP CAMERA WAS A MUST AND THE BLIND SPOT ALERT HIGHLY
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SAFETY FEATURE OF BLIND SPOT ASSISTANCE
SOMETIMES THE ARROWS FOR THE BLIND SPOT ARE RED AND MAKE A NOISE BUT THERE IS NOTHING THERE WHICH COULD CAUSE AN ACCIDENT IF YOU ARE SWITCHING LANES AND BEEPS ARE OF NO WHERE
THE FRONT WINDSHIELD WIPER PATHS APPEAR TO BE DESIGNED FOR EUROPEAN LEFT HAND DRIVING BECAUSE THE PASSENGER WIPER STOPS DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DRIVER S SIGHT LINE VERY ANNOYING AND DISTRACTING
REAR VIEW CAMERA IN DARK IS NOT CLEAR LANE PICTURE NEXT TO THE REAR VIEW OBSTRUCTS PARTIAL REAR VIEW NAVIGATION SCREEN IS OUTDATED FOR
BIG BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES
NEEDS A HEADS UP DISPLAY
REAR VIEW MIRROR HAS A TINY SLIT TO SEE OUT BACK WINDOW IF YOUR NOT TURNING YOUR ENTIRE BODY YOUR NOT SEEING EVERYTHING OUT OF ANY OF ITS MIRRORS
VISIBILITY FROM DRIVER S SEAT TO THE AREA AROUND RIGHT REAR QUARTER AREA OF THE CAR IS VERY VERY POOR WHEN BACKING UP PARTICULARLY WHEN A LARGER VEHICLE SUV PICKUP TRUCK VAN IS PARKED ALONG SIDE OF YOU YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY MOVING PERHAPS FU
BACK WINDOWS SHOULD BE LARGER BECAUSE THEY RE SO SMALL I CAN T SEE OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER TO SEE IF A CAR IS SLIGHTLY TO MY BACK RIGHT THE REAR VIEW MIRROR BEING COATED IN ANTI SHINE STUFF IS GREAT AT NIGHT
THE REAR VIEW THROUGH THE HATCH WINDOW IS VERY NARROW HOWEVER I GOT USED TO IT VERY QUICKLY I HAD READ ABOUT THIS IN CONSUMER REPORTS SO IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I CONSIDERED CAREFULLY BEFORE BUYING THE CAR THE CAR IS SMALL ENOUGH THA
THE WORST THING IS THE VISIBILITY WHENEVER CARS DRIVE UP TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT
BLIND SPOTS ARE PART OF THE NATURE OF THE BEAST
HUGE BLIND SPOTS MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO CHECK SURROUNDINGS WHILE BACKING OUT OF A PARKING SPOT
VISIBILITY IMPROVED WHEN I RAISED THE DRIVERS SEAT
IT WOULD BE NICE IF ALL YOUR CARS CAME WITH SELF DIMING REAR VIEW MIRRORS AT NO EXTRA CHARGE THESE ARE REALLY NICE
THE REAR VIEW MIRRORS KIND OF BLOCKS THE CAR TO YOUR LEFT WHEN MAKING A FULL STOP IN A FOUR WAY STOP STREET
VISIBILITY IS EXCELLENT THE BEST CAR THAT I VE DROVE SO FAR
FEELS LIKE A BIG BLIND SPOT
THE REAR VIEW MIRROR HAS A LIMITED VIEW UNLESS YOU ARE SEATED AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT HEIGHT
A COUPLE OF BLIND SPOTS WHEN PASSING BUT THE BACKUP CAMERA HAS ME REALLY SPOILED
ONLY DOWN FLAW OF THE CAR IS WHEN CHANGING LANES YOU CAN T DOUBLE CHECK BLIND SPOTS BY LOOKING OVER YOUR SHOULDER ESPECIALLY ON THE DRIVERS SIDE MIRRORS NEED TO BE ADJUSTED CORRECTLY IMMEDIATELY
THE VISIBILITY THROUGH THE BACK UP CAMERA IS POOR ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT
TOWARDS VISIBILITY IS NOT QUITE GOOD WHEN PARTING ETC
VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES NOT SO GOOD SIDE MIRRORS COULD HAVE THOSE LITTLE INSERT MIRRORS
THE POSTS IN THE FRONT CORNERS ARE KIND OF BIG AND CAN CAUSE BLIND SPOTS
I DON T KNOW IF THIS IS RELEVANT HERE BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A MOM REAR VIEW MIRROR SO IT IS EASY TO SEE KIDS PASSENGERS IN SECOND AND THIRD ROWS
THE REAR SEAT HEAD RESTS MAKE A BIG BLIND SPOT
THERE ARE BLIND SPOTS IN THE BACK ON THE SIDES BY THE REAR DOORS
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER SIDE FRAM BETWEEN DRIVER DOOR AND REAR DOOR IS TO WIDE
ONE THING WE MISSED ON OUR OLD FIESTA WAS THE CONCAVE MIRROR ON THE OUTER CORNER OF OUR SIDE MIRRORS WHICH WOULD CATCH OUR BLIND SPOTS
THE PASSENGER DOOR MIRROR COULD TILT DOWN WHEN REVERSING TO ALLOW FOR GREATER EASE IN SEEING THE CURB FOR PARALLEL PARKING
SUN VISORS NEED EXTENDERS IN THEM OR THEY NEED TO BE BIGGER ALSO DOOR REAR VIEW MIRRORS NEED TO BE HEATED I DON T THINK IT WAS AN OPTION ON THE PRO 4X SINCE THE LAST ONE I HAD DIDN T HAVE THEM EITHER
BACK WINDOW COULD BE LARGER TO INCREASE REAR VISIBILITY
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT BEHIND REAR SEAT AND CARGO AREA
SURPRISED AT THE VISIBLITY FROM THE DRIVERS SEAT THE FIRST TIME I SAT IN IT I WAS VERY PLEASED AND CAN SEE OUT MUCH BETTER THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED
SUN VISORS SEEM TO HAVE A LOOSE CONNECTION AND POP OUT OF ITS CLIP WHEN PUT DOWN HEAD LIGHT LOOK TO BE SHINING HIGHER THAN NORMAL WOULD LIKE TO INSTAL FOG LIGHTS TO FILL IN THE GAP
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT BETWEEN THE FRONT AND SIDE WINDOWS DUE TO VEHICLE CONSTRUCTION
THE VISIBILITY OF THE WINDOW CONFIGURATION ELIMINATES BLIND SPOTS
I REALLY LIKE THE VISIBILITY FOR THE DRIVER I AM SMALL AND STILL HAVE GOOD VISIBILITY
BLIND SPOT FOR CHANGING LANES IS PRETTY LARGE CAN T CHANGE LANES WITHOUT FIRST LOOKING OUT REAR PASSENGER WINDOWS
WORLD LIKE MORE COLLISION AVOIDANCE FEATURES
WHILE TURNING THE DRIVER S VISIBILITY IS VERY POOR AS THE STRUCTURAL MEMBERS SIDE MEMBERS HOLDING WIND SHEILD GOING FROM THE HOOD TO THE ROOF BLOCK THE VIEW TO THE SIDE IT IS WORST DURING THE DARK
REVERSE AT NIGHT IS DANGEROUS YOU DON T HAVE ENOUGH LIGHT ALONG WITH THE TINTED REAR WINDOW OR USING MIRRORS ALSO THE THICK FRAME ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FRONT WINDSHIELD IS QUITE HARD TO SEE AROUND WHEN YOU HAVE WIDE CURVES IN THE ROAD
I EXPERIENCE A BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANES IF I ONLY USE THE SIDE MIRRORS I MUST ALWAYS TURN MY HEAD TO CHECK LANES BEFORE CHANGING
THE VEHICLE SUPPORTS BETWEEN THE WINDSHIELD AND THE DOORS CAUSE SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS I HAVE A CDL AND A BUS DRIVER ENDORSEMENT I UNDERSTAND SAFETY ISSUES THE SUPPORTS CAUSES ABOUT 3 MAJOR BLIND SPOTS ON EITHER SIDE FRONT SIDE REAR
GENERALLY SOLID FEEL WITH GOOD VISIBILITY BETTER THAN EXPECTED VISIBILITY
VISIBILITY SEEMS SOMEWHAT LIMITED WHEN DRIVING THE CAR MOST NOTICEABLE WHEN TURNING
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN LOOKING TO THE REAR OF THE CAR
BLIND SPOT WHEN CHANGING LANE AND LOOKING BACK BY TURNING HEAD
BUILT IN CONVEX PORTION OF SIDE MIRRORS TO BETTER VIEW BLIND SPOT WOULD BE NICE HAD TO ADD GLUE ON BULLETS TO FEEL SAFE CHANGING LANES
WOULD HAVE REALLY LIKED AND AUTOMATIC FRONT COLLISION AND REAR CROSS TRAFFIC BRAKING SYSTEM THE BLIND SPOT AND REAR CROSS TRAFFIC WARNING SYSTEMS DO HELP I LOVE THE BACK UP CAMERA AS WELL AS THE FRONT AND OVERALL CAMERA DISPLAY GREAT WHEN PA
THE SIDE MOUNTED REAR VIEW MIRRORS COULD BE MOUNTED LOWER TO IMPROVE OVER ALL VISIBILITY IN THE FORWARD LEFT AND RIGHT QUADRANTS
HEADLIGHTS TO NOT SHINE FAR ENOUGH INTO THE DISTANCE YOU ARE BASICALLY DRIVING BEYOND YOUR HEADLIGHT VISIBILITY
I FIND THERE IS A BLIND SPOT WHEN MAKING A LEFT AND LOOKING OUT THE FRONT PASSENGER SIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD
THE BODY SHAPE THE DOOR AND FRAME PART HOLDING THE WINDSHIELD IN PLACE AND THE DRIVER SIDE MIRROR PROHIBIT A BIT OF VISIBILITY BUT THAT IS A SMALL LIMITATION AND THE REST OF THE VISITIBLITY IS GREAT
WITH ALL THE ADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES YOU DO FEEL VERY SAFE WHEN DRIVING ESPECIALLY THE ADAPTIVE CRUISE
SIDE POSTS RESTRICT VISIBILITY OF THE FRONT LEFT SIDE
HAS SERIOUS BLIND SPOTS IF DETECTION SYSTEM QUITS WORKING NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE
BETTER HEATED WINDSHIELD WIPER
WISH IT HAD AUTOMATIC WIPERS
BAD BLIND SPOT ON FRONT WINDSHIELD PASSENGER SIDE
WHEN THE THIRD ROW SEAT IS UP IT DOES SLIGHTLY REDUCE THE VISIBILITY OUT OF THE REAR WINDOW
THERE IS DEFINITELY A BLIND SPOT WHEN ANOTHER VEHICLE PASSES
BACK UP CAMERA OF LOW QUALITY FRONT AND SIDE CAMERAS NOT A REAL HELP
THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS ARE VITAL TO SIDE VISIBILITY WITHOUT THOSE ALERTS SIDE VISIBILITY WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE
THE EXTERIOR DRIVER SIDE MIRROR CREATES A LARGE BLIND SPOT WHEN MAKING A LEFT TURN
NEED TO BUILD IN MIRROW FOR WHEN PASSING OR CHANGING LANES EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE WARNING SYSTEM
LOVE THE ADJUSTING CRUISE CONTROL
BAD DRIVER S SIDE BLIND SPOT
LOVE ALL THE EXTRA SAFETY FEATURES
THE REAR VIEW AND THE AROUND VIEW CAMERAS GIVE THE DRIVER GOOD VISIBILITY WHEN PARKING OR BACKING UP
REALLY LIKE THE WARNING WHEN SOMEONE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT
I WOULD HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME IF THERE WASN T A REAR BACK UP CAMERA THE REAR STICKS OUT AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE
THE CAMERAS AND OTHER WARNING SYSTEMS ARE NEEDED WITH THE TALL HEADREST ON ALL THE SEATS
BACK DOOR WINDOW BLIND SPOT
THE QUEST IS VERY SMOOTH AND QUITE WHILE DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD FOR A LARGE MINI VAN IT HAS SURPRISINGLY GREAT VISIBILITY THE ADJUSTABLE HEADLIGHTS ARE JUST PLAIN COOL THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR IS THE GREATEST DRIVING TOOL AND SHOULD BE MANDATORY
WINDSHIELD WIPERS ARE EXCELLENT VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR WINDOW IMPEDED BY 3RD ROW SEAT HEADRESTS OF COURSE PASSENGERS WOULD DO THE SAME
VISIBILITY FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT OUT THE BACK WINDOW IS DIFFICULT GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE BACK WINDOW
ALTHOUGH IT S A SAFETY FEATURE I FEEL AS THOUGH THE LANE CHANGING DETECTION STAYS ON A LITTLE LONGER EVEN IF THE CAR IS FAR ENOUGH BEHIND TO PASS SAFELY WOULDN T EXPECT CHANGES FROM MANUFACTURER THOUGH BETTER TO BE SAFE THERE IS GOOD VISIBI
BLIND SPOT ON DRIVER SIDE TO THE LEFT CORNER FORWARD VISIBILITY IS GREAT BUT LEFT BETWEEN 40 AND 50 DEGREES IS COMPLETELY BLIND FOR ME
FEELING OF SAFETY WHEN OPERATING VEHICLE
FOR WHAT I PAID FOR THIS VEHICLE IT SHOULD COME STANDARD WITH HID HEADLIGHTS SHAME ON YOU NISSAN YOU REALLY MISSED THE BOAT ON THIS ONE
I DO TEND TO HAVE A BLIND SPOT IN THE FRONT DUE TO COLUMN FOR THE FRONT WINDOW I HAVE TO LOOK A FEW TIMES ALSO THE WIND SHIELD WASHER TANK FLUID FROZE SNOWY DAY SUCKS GREAT IF THE MIRRORS ARE ICE FREE BUT WHEN YOU CANT SEE OUT OF THE WIND
LOTS OF GREAT SAFETY FEATURES
BLIND SPOTS IN FRONT SIDES
THE FLUID ONLY SPRAYS ABOUT 2 ABOVE THE WIPER BLADE IN FRONT
I HAVE SHORT LEGS AND ALWAYS DRIVE WITH THE SEAT MOVED FORWARD I FIND THAT THERE IS A DEFINITE BLIND SPOT WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO SEE CARS THAT ARE SLIGHTLY BEHIND IN THE LANES NEXT TO ME
MY WIFE IS 5 SO MANY OF THE RATING MARKS OF AVERAGE HAVE TO TAKE THIS INTO ACCOUNT HOWEVER I AM ALMOST 6 TALL AND DO NOT LIKE THE REAR VISIBILITY WHEN CHANGING LANES
BLIND SPOT ON FRONT WINDSHIELD DRIVER S SIDE
THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY BLIND SPOTS I NEED A CLASS TO LEARN HOW TO EFFECTIVELY USE ALL OF THE CAMERAS I THINK THIS CAR IS HARDER TO DRIVE THAN OTHER CARS I HAVE HAD BECAUSE OF THIS
LIKE SUN VISOR EXTENSIONS THEY COME IN HANDY A LOT
WISH THERE WERE MORE OPTIONS WITH THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS
BODY STYLE LENDS ITSELF TO SERIOUS BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER REAR SIDE OF VEHICLE AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WELL OUT THE BACK WINDOW WHEN THE CAMERA IS OCCLUDED EG BY RAIN THAT S MY MAIN ISSUE WHICH MAKES LANE CHANGING TO THE RIGHT TRICKIER
LOVE THE BLIND SPOT MONITOR AND THE LANE DEPARTURE MONITOR IT S ALWAYS REFRESHING TO GET A WARNING JUST INCASE I COULDN T SEE SOMETHING
THERE IS A VERY BAD BLIND SPOT ON THESE VEHICLES ON BOTH SIDES SECONDARY MIRRORS ARE NEEDED TO BE SURE THAT YOU DO NOT GET IN A COLLISION THE BLIND SPOT IS RIGHT WHERE THE REAR WINDOW AND REAR DOORS MEET IN THAT SPACE YOU CANNOT SEE THE LANE
BLIND SPOTS ARE AN ISSUE AND REVERSE CAMERA SHOULD HAVE AN AUDIO WARNING INDICATOR WHEN TOO CLOSE TO ANOTHER OBJECT
THANK GOD FOR REAR VIEW CAMERAS
FRONT VISIBILITY IS GOOD SIDE VISIBILITY IS OK REAR VISIBILITY IS POOR THERE ARE STILL BLIND SPOTS IN THIS VEHICLE I HAD TO REMOVE THE REAR SEAT HEADRESTS TO SEE OUT THE BACK WINDOW THE ROGUE HAS HAD THIS PROBLEM FOREVER I REALIZE THAT TH
THE CAR HAS MORE BLIND SPOTS THAN MY LAST VEHICLE
MORE BLIND SPOTS THAN I AM USED TO
THERE ARE SEVERAL BLIND SPOTS WHEN DRIVING THIS VEHICLE ESPECIALLY WHEN CHANGING LANES ETC
SUN VISORS ARE TO SMALL THE REAR VIEW MIRROR SHOULD ADAPT AUTOMATIC WHEN IT GETS DARK OUT
THE CAR HAS REALLY BAD BLIND SPOTS
BLIND SPOT WARNING GOES OFF SAYING SOMEONE IS IN MY BLIND SPOT SOMETIMES WHEN I AM ON A ROAD WITH NO OTHER VEHICLES I VE NOTICED THIS QUITE A FEW TIMES AND IT MAY HAVE BEEN RAINING EACH TIME
NEED TO INTEGRATE CONVEX MIRROR AREA IN THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS I HAVE THE PEEL AND STICK ONES BUT THEY ARE BETTER THAN NOTHING
THE WINDSHIELD WIPERS WERE SO BAD AND BRAND NEW THAT I REPLACED IMMEDIATELY WITH HIGHER QUALITY
I WISH I WAS ABLE TO GET THE CAMERA FOR BEING ABLE TO SEE THE BLIND SPOT ON DRIVERS SIDE WHILE DRIVING I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A CAR THAT I FELT COULD BE DRIVEN ON ALL KINDS OF TERRAIN SNOW BACKCOUNTRY ROADS
REALLY GOOD VISIBILITY IN ALL SECTIONS OF THE VEHICLE
BACK SEAT HEADREST COMPLICATES VISIBILITY TO THE REAR SIDE MIRRORS HINDER VISIBILITY WHEN TURNING I THINK THEY ARE LARGER THAN THEY NEED TO BE
WISH I HAD ALARM WHEN BACKING UP I DID HAVE REAR CAMERA IN PREVIOUS ALTIMA
I BELIEVE A REAR CAMERA SHOULD BE STANDARD EQUIPMENT ON ALL CARS AND TRUCKS
I ALREADY HAD ONE COMMENT ABOUT VISIBILITY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WITH THE DRIVER S SEAT ALL THE WAY BACK WHEN YOU TURN YOUR HEAD TO THE LEFT TO CHECK FOR OTHER VEHICLES WHEN YOU ARE CHANGING LANES YOU ARE LOOKING RIGHT AT THE ROOF PILLAR
REAR SET HEAD RESTS LIMITS REAR VISIBILITY
DRIVES VERY WELL LARGER VEHICLE A SAFETY FEATURE CONSIDERING THE LAST X TERRA I HAD SOME 14 YEARS MOST LIKELY SAVED MY LIFE
LARGE EXTERIOR REAR VIEW MIRROWS
THE VEHICLE VISIBILITY AND DRIVING SAFETY IS ADEQUATE GIVEN MY UTILITARIAN PURPOSES AND THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE VEHICLE
IT S DIFFICULT WITH LIMITED VISIBILITY FROM REAR VIEW MIRROR WHEN REAR SEATS HAVE HEADRESTS MOUNTED I NEED TO REMOVE THEM TO ENSURE PROPER AND SAFE DRIVING
REAR VISIBILITY DESPITE OVERSIZED BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE IT IS VERY RARE TO FIND A VEHICLE WITH DECENT REAR VISIBILITY IN TODAY S MARKET
SEEMS LIKE A FAIRLY LARGE BLIND SPOT FOR CHECKING LANE BEFORE PASSING
I REALLY LIKE THE VISIBILITY THERE ARE MINIMAL BLIND SPOTS
STILL HAS A BIG BLIND SPOT ON THE PASSENGER S SIDE
THE CAR IS STILL QUITE NEW TO ME I THINK I MAY HAVE BEEN NOTICING SOME BLIND SPOTS MAYBE I THINK IT S TOO SOON TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN IF THESE EXPERIENCES ARE JUST CIRCUMSTANTIAL
VISIBILITY WHEN LOOKING OUT BACK SIDES COULD BE IMPROVED MORE GLASS
ONE OF THE REASONS WE CHOSE THIS CAR WAS THE SUPREME VISIBILITY FROM THE COCKPIT
HEAD REST BLOCKS BLIND SPOT ON THE DRIVERS SIDE
REAR VISIBILITY WHEN BACKING UP IS AWKWARD AS IS CHANGING LANES THE REAR C PILLAR IS A HINDERANCE FORWARD VISION IS VERY GOOD
THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IN VISIBILITY I HAVE EXPERIENCED IS THE LIMITED VIEW WHEN THE CONVERTIBLE TOP HAS BEEN FULLY DECLINED MAKING CARS BEHIND MY SMART VERY DIFFICULT TO VIEW QUICKLY
I RATE THE SAFETY AS FANTASTIC DESPITE OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT IN WHICH I HYDROPLANED CAUGHT AIR GOING OVER A 12 + EMBANKMENT AND ROLLED 450 DEGREES A FULL SOMERSAULT FORWARD AND A QUARTER TURN ONTO THE PASSENGER SIDE I WALKED A
POOR DOOR MIRRORS WITH HUGE BLIND SPOT POOR VISIBILITY OVER DRIVER S SHOULDER WHEN LANE CHANGING NO BACK UP CAMERA
CHECKING THE BLIND SPOT CAN BE TRICKY UNTIL YOU GET USED TO DRIVING THE CAR
I REALLY LOVE THE LARGE WINDOWS FOR VISIBILITY
VERY BAD BLIND SPOTS ESPECIALLY TRYING TO BACKING UP
BLIND SPOT ON PASSENGER SIDE REAR PANEL
FOR AS SMALL AND SPORTY AS THIS CAR IS IT HAS GREAT VISIBILITY AND DOES NOT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE DRIVING A CAR THAT IS AS SMALL AS IT IS
THE WINDOW BEHIND THE B PILLAR IS SO SMALL THAT IT GETS BLOCKED EASILY BY THE SEATS WHEN SHOULDER CHECKING BLIND SPOTS IT HAS FORCED ME TO UTILIZE A DIFFERENT METHOD OF LOOKING AT MY BLIND SPOTS
GREAT ALL ROUND VISIBILITY
EXCELLENT VISIBILITY FAR SUPERIOR TO OTHER ROBUST MID SIZE SUVS
OVERALL VISIBILITY
NEEDS HEADS UP DISPLAY REAR VIDEO PARKING ASSIST REAR VISION IS ABYSMAL BORDERING ON DANGEROUS
INCREDIBLY MANEUVERABLE AND IT STOPS VERY QUICKLY REAR AND QUARTER VISIBILITY IS NATURALLY IMPAIRED BECAUSE IT IS A CONVERTIBLE
VISIBILITY OUT THE REAR IS COMPROMISED BY THE HEADRESTS AND MIDDLE SEATBELT BUT AT LEAST THEY ARE REMOVABLE VISIBILITY OVER THE FRONT RIGHT FENDER IS THE POOREST PART OF ANY OTHERWISE STELLAR VIEW FROM THE DRIVER S SEAT
I HAVE A SPECIAL REAR VIEW MIRROR THAT I PURCHASED TO ENLARGED & ENHANCE THE REAR VIEW I VE ALWAYS USED IT
I FEEL THAT THE CONTROL PANEL FOR THE RADIO AND BACK UP CAMERA IS NOT BRIGHT ENOUGH I HAVE YET TO LOOK IN MY MANUAL TO SEE IF THE BRIGHTNESS CAN BE ADJUSTED
WE CHECKED THE SAFETY RATING AND THE REPAIR RECORD BEFORE BUYING THIS VEHICLE THE LARGE BACKUP CAMERA WAS IMPORTANT TO US
I HAD FOG LIGHTS INSTALLED IN MY CAR
THERE IS A BLIND SPOT ON THE SIDE OF CAR THAT THE SIDE MIRROR DOES NOT SHOW UP I HAVE BEEN IN CARS THAT LET YOU SLIDE THE VISOR FURTHER OVER WHEN ON SIDE WINDOW I LIKE THAT FEATURE
LIKE BACK UP CAMERA AND WARNING
I WOULD PREFER TO HAVE THE WINDSHIELD WIPER LIQUID DISPERSED IN A WIDE MIST RATHER THAN A SINGLE SPRAY SPRAY IS TAD TOO HIGH AND IT DOES NOT MAKE THE WINDSHIELD WET ENOUGH
I WISH THE BLIND SPOTS WERE SMALLER
I LOVE ALL THE AIR BAGS
I REALLY LIKE THE RAIN SENSING WIPER FEATURE AND REARVIEW CAMERA
BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS IN THE WAY WHEN LOOKING IN BACK OF VEHICLE BUT BACKUP CAMERA HELPS THAT HAVE TO HAVE MY FRONT WASHER SPRAYER CHECKED OUT DOESN T SPRAY TO CORRECT PLACE TO WASH WINDOW ESPECIALLY ON DRIVERS WINDOW
THE HEAD RESTS ON REAR SEATS BLOCK VISIBILITY
THE VISIBILITY IS WHAT SOLD ME ON THIS CAR I WAS LOOKING AT SUV S OF ALL BRANDS BUT THE VISIBILITY OF THE NEW ONES ARE HORRIBLE SO I WENT WITH THE MIRAGE
NEED TO PUT CONVEX MIRRORS ON THE SIDE MIRRORS
EVERYTHING IS VISIBLE WITH MINIMAL BLINDSPOTS
I THINK THE SIDE VIEW MIRRORS ARE RATHER LARGE LEAVING A BLIND SPOT IN THAT SECTION WHEN I M TURNING ESPECIALLY FOR A SHORTER DRIVER
BLIND SPOT TO DRIVERS SIDE REAR
THE VISIBILITY SIDE AND REAR IS GENERALLY TERRIBLE � BUT THE CAR IS SO FAST THAT THERE S RARELY SOMEONE IN MY BLIND SPOT
SIGNIFICANT BLIND SPOTS OUT OF REAR WINDOW DUE TO HIGH BACK SEAT HEAD RESTS AND MINIMAL REAR WINDOW SIZE
I HAVE TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL WITH BLIND SPOTS AS IT S MUCH MUCH HARDER TO SEE WHEN LANE TURNING
BLIND SPOTS WHEN CHANGING LANES CAN T SEE CARS RIGHT NEXT TO THE REAR DOOR AREA CARS CAN BE IN THE BLIND SPOT HAVE TO REALLY LOOK BEHIND YOU TO AVOID HITTING THE CAR
I REALLY ENJOY HOW I CAN CONNECT MY PHONE WITH THE BLUETOOTH
THE ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM IS USER FRIENDLY AND PROVIDES EXCELLANT QUALITY
I LOVE MY NEW TRUCK AND EVERY ASPECT OF IT NOT SURE WHAT I WOULD CALL MY FAVORITE PART OF THE AUDIO COMM  ENTER AND I DON T HAVE A NAVIGATION SYSTEM SORRY CAN T BE MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT JUST SUFFICE IT TO SAY I LOVE MY NEW TRUCK
THE VARIETY OF STATIONS LATIN MUSIC CLASSIC RADIO STATION COUNTRY MUSIC JAZZ
REALLY LIKE THE BLUETOOTH AUDIO CONNECTION
THE COLOR DISPLAY AND IMPROVED LAYOUT FOR DISPLAYING IPOD INFORMATION IS FAR SUPERIOR TO MY PREVIOUS FRONTIER
BLUETOOTH PHONE CONNECTION MICROPHONE AND SPEAKERS WORK FLAWLESSLY
VOICE RECOGNITION ALLOWS ME TO CHANGE OR SET DESTINATION WHILE I M UNDERWAY WITHOUT TAKING MY EYES OFF THE ROAD
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM MAP ZOOMS IN AND OUT AS THE VEHICLE SPEEDS UP AND SLOWS DOWNS
THE BLUETOOTH USE FOR MAKING PHONE CALLS ITS ANOTHER EXTENSION OF MY OFFICE
THE ONLY THING THAT I DO NOT LIKE IN REGARDS TO THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS THE FACT THAT THE NAVIGATION CANNOT BE ROUTED RE ROUTED WHILE THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION THIS MEANS THAT EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A PASSANGER WHO IS INPUTTING THE ROUTE TO THE NAVI
I CAN ONLY WISH IT WOULD VE CAME WITH NAVIGATION SYSTEM THAT IS THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT MY NEW JUKE THAT DID COME WITH ONE VERY VERY SAD

BLUETOOTH CAPABILITY I USE IT FOR CALLS TEXT AND MUSIC

BLUETOOTH AND BLUETOOTH CONTROLS ON THE STEERING WHEEL I LOVE BEING ABOUT TO CALL OUT AND ANSWER THE CELLPHONE WITHOUT TAKING MY HANDS FROM THE STEERING WHEEL
I DO WANT TO ADD THAT THE ONLY THING I DON T ENJOY ABOUT THE USB PLUG IN IS THAT IT AUTOMATICALLY STARTS PLAYING MUSIC ON MY DEVICE I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TURN OFF THAT FEATURE ON THE PHONE AND IT INSTANTLY STARTS BLASTING MUSIC WHEN PLUGGED IN
LOVE THE EASE OF MAKING PHONE CALLS
I LIKE THE BLUETOOTH CONNECTION IT S NICE NOT HAVING TO RUN CORDS AND THE SOUND QUALITY OVER IT IS VERY GOOD
WE LOVE THE TECH SYSTEMS IN OUR NEW MURANO AND IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE BOUGHT IT I AM 71 YEARS OLD BUT CAN UNDERSTAND THE CONTROLS WE JUST CAME BACK FROM A ROAD TRIP AND LOVED THE NAVI SYSTEM
LOVE THE HANDS FREE BLUETOOTH PHONE SYSTEM ALSO THE EASE IN WHICH I COULD LOAD ALL MY CELL PHONE NUMBERS INTO THE CARS S SYSTEM THE EXTRA LARGE 8 NAVIGATION SCREEN IS QUITE A BENEFIT
EASE OF OPERATION WHETHER BY VOICE TOUCH SCREEN OR PUSH BUTTONS
THE NAVAGATION SYSTEM IS AWESOME BEING ABLE TO DO ROUTING BY VOICE COMANDS IS GREAT THE BOSE SYSTEM IS ALSO GREAT
I DIDN T HAVE ONE IN MY OLD CAR SO ITS GREAT VERY EASY TO USE AND REALLY NICE WHEN VISITING PLACES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO WITH ALL THE ONE WAY STREETS OUR OTHER CAR IS A HYNDAI AND THE NAVIGATION HAS AN EXTREMELY LOUD ANNOYING BEEP AT EVERY TURN
EXCELLENT OVERALL SOUND QUALITY ESPECIALLY PHONE
THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM IS CONNECTED TO ALL THE OTHER DEVICE IN THE CAR THAT MAKE IT EASIER TO UTILIZE ALL DEVICES
I LOVE THE OPTION OF DIAL AND TOUCH SCREEN
NAVIGATION SYSTEN SE IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND USE
BOSE SPEAKERS ARE JUST PLAIN CRISP AND CLEAR THEY ARE EXCEPTIONAL
SIZE OF NAVIGATION DISPLAY
THE TOUCH SCREEN IS EASY TO SEE IN ANY LIGHT AND VERY EASY TO USE
I CAN TALK USING MY BLUETOOTH AND STILL GET MY NAVIGATION DIRECTIONS ALSO LISTEN TO MY MUSIC AND STILL GET DIRECTIONS FROM THE NAV SYSTEM
THE POSSIBILITY OF MAKING AND RECEIVING PHONE CALLS VIA BLUETOOTH WITHOUT LEAVING THE STEERING WHEEL UNATTENDED

NAVIGATION INTERFACE IS A LITTLE CLUNKY TO INPUT A LOCATION YOU CAN T MUTE THE VOICE I D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SAVE ALERTS FOR SONGS OR BANDS ON THE SIRIUS XM RADIO ALSO
IT S EASY TO USE IT MAKES MY MERCEDES NAV LOOK LIKE A PAPER MAP AND TRYING TO PUT AN ADDRESS IN IS LIKE TRYING TO SOLVE A RUBIKS CUBE

I WISH THE MP3 WAS EASIER AND SHOWED THE MUSIC PICTURES ETC LIKE THE CHEAP PIONEER THAT YOU PUT IN YOUR BEATER CAR IT S NICER
THE OPTIONAL BOSE SYSTEM IS VERY NICE THE SYSTEMS ARE MUCH EASIER TO USE THAN MY WIFE S BMW 5 SERIES
GREAT STEREO SYSTEM

THE SOUND QUALITY ON BLUETOOTH CALLS AND BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY IS WONDERFUL HOWEVER WE ARE ONLY ABLE TO PAIR ONE DEVICE WE LEAVE MY SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 PAIRED EVEN IF I M NOT IN THE CAR BECAUSE THE CAR DOES NOT RECOGNIZE MY HUSBANDS GALAXY S4
