The only issue I have is that I was driving it in very hard rain and the car slid quite a few times even while driving slowly.
The overall look and feel of the vehicle.
It's a great car.
"I love this car, but I wish it had a more quiet ride."
Seats and smooth ride
I have owned several Nissan vehicles and have always recommended them to friends and family.  I love Tom Peacock - we always get a better deal and better customer service than other dealerships we have visited.
"I don't feel anything can be done about how I feel. It is a beautiful car. I just don't like some things about it. Wish I had researched more and comparing to my previous vehicle, I miss the car I traded in. I probably would not purchase this vehicle again."
"Warranty, audio system. Cruise control is great. Comfort."
"It has a lot of bells, my opinion is based on personal feelings so I wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from purchasing if they like it"
"For the price the Murano is a beautifully designed car.  The navigation system is exceptional. Owning two Mercedes Benz vehicles, I find this product to be a good buy for the family member and i am sure it will give them the feeling of driving in class.  The voices used in the car are very clear and the space to the rear is especially good for what we need it for.  I have usually purchased upper level cars like Mercedes, Lexus and Cadillac  but for the price, this is a great product and something for one to consider.  I look forward to many years of service.  I might recommend that you offer 4 years of oil changes with the vehicle like some other car companies are doing namely or 3 years to coincide with your warranty.  This would be a great selling point with people knowing they would not have to put any money out for three years and might be a reason why they would want to trade every three years."
The navigation system.
For the money it is a good looking vehicle and I believe would service the people very well.  Again love that nav system.
Not sure where to move the steering wheel computer buttons but I don't like them there.  The doors are very heavy and I have trouble getting the door to stay open when I get out.  It's always closing on me :-).  A wider color selection would be nice too.  I know I saw a dark wood grain interior in a car at a car show but when we purchased our car it wasn't available but I loved the car and we purchased it anyway.
Its a beautiful car -- the inside cabin lighting makes it look very elegant in the evening.  It works well and over all it works great.  I'm still having issues with how everything works (the computer functions) but its nice to have them all available.
Computer learning curve.
It seems to me that the shock absorbers and stiffness of  the tires are more    evident than on my previous Quest van.   The tire pressure is  correct.
"I love the safety features, blind side warning indicators.  I feel more safe."
This is my third Nissan in succession and I have had excellent service from all   so far. I believe Nissan to be very reliable products.
controls on steering wheel is hard to get used to.(in the wrong place)
apperence
"looks ,price,and mostly dealership"
Wife loves  her Marano
Drives good
Have bought my last 3 vehicles@ nissan
Nothing. Its great so far.
Its my sixth Nissan and second Murano. I like Nissan and Murano is perfect for my needs.
"really like the car. room, comfortable decent mileage."
This is my 6th Nissan and they have all been great
"Great vehicle, very satisied"
A powerful vehicle with good gas mileage
This the fourth Murano I have leased. Each one has been a little better than previous.
Add back up radar warning system and rain sensor wipers.
Emergency braking system and cruise control warning system  are great. heated steering wheel  is a wonderful feature. Seats are very comfortable which is good for long trips.
"The Murano has excellent safety technology emergency braking systems and is very easy to drive and park. The mileage is good,  pick up is good, and seats are comfortable.  The selection screen is user-friendly and dashboard controls are easily accessible."
Great car
I LOVE MY NEW MURANO.  I HAVE HAD NO ISSUES AT ALL WITH IT.  FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE AND SAFE IN IT.
I LOVE THAT THE SEAT BRINGS ME UP MORE AND I CAN SEE 360 DEG.
"AS STATED BEFORE, I LOVE THE CAR.  IT DRIVES VERY WELL FOR A LARGE SUV.  I WAS ABLE TO GET LUXURY AND SPORT LOOK IN ONE"
lower outside noise level from the wheels and tires
comfort in the front seats and leg room for the price that the vehicle cost
nothing is prefect in the vehicles build prior to and present time
"I have two months that I bought the car, and they still haven't finished what they supposedly were going to do with the car, witch is change the color of the leather. I have lost so much time and I'm really disappointed on the service, IF I COULD RETURN THE CAR I WOULD because they didn't follow the contract we did."
I really like the model of the outside and inside too if it was finished.
I don't really have anything agains Nissan I'm just pissed off from the service there
Center console glove box is not as usable as previous models with tray that does not lift up with lid.
Exterior styling
Great value and performance
"The reliability, and that its brand new"
The car has shown no problems. It's brand new
Like the car
The dealership turned me off.
Fuel tank gauge should be kit.  Difficult to see
Valet parking
Location of gas tank and lack of DVD players for passengers in the platinum model
It's my wife's vehicle and the most important thing to me is that she is happy with it. We purchased it over the Honda Pilot and the Toyota Highlander ONLY because she has a bad hip and she was most comfortable in this vehicle.
"I have purchased over 30 new vehicles in my life. There are many good products in the market. I was very happy with my Altima but only keep it for a few years. We plan to keep this vehicle 10 years. Ask me the same question 10 years from now and based on the reliability of the vehicle and the service received from the dealer that number could go up or down. You should send this survey out at intervals such as one year, perhaps when the vehicle is pad off ect."
"We previously owned a Murano and wanted another and haven't been disappointed. The one thing I've noticed, are the controls on the steering wheel for the audio system. The buttons are on the down side of the arm of the wheel and are inconvenient, not a huge issue."
"Pretty much everything. Love the looks, the interior is beautiful, ride and handling are great."
"Question is redundant, I previously said I love the vehicle."
Overall Im satisfied just the few minor issues
"The body style, interior and the overall sunroof It is a very sleek looking SUV"
For the fact that I haven't had it very long and I have never owned a Nissan so I'm not sure how satisfied I will be in the years to come. Havwe heard of the reliability but never experinced until now
Its the best suv at relation price-car
The power and the exterior locking
"Because is a japan made , power and loock are excelente"
Right now I am totally satisfied
The smoothness of the ride
"Because overall it is a great manufacturer of vehicles, they are built to last."
I would just like my 28 to 29/30 miles to the gallon but I don't understand when it was new were and had like 12/13 miles on it it was getting that and now that it's got approximately 4000 miles on it it seems like it's dropped about 5 miles to the gallon
It's a very nice vehicle overall thank you
Because I give tens very rarely
like the features with the drivability but wish i still could have bought a new quest.
loike the cruise features the best along with the drivability
still a little disturbed that you scrapped the quest.  i wanted another new one and was told that nissan was not manufacturing any longer.
The handling & stability is exceptional.
Haven't found anything that I don't like about the vehicle.
Buy it back
The Design
No comment
Passenger seat is only 4 way power
"easy to use controls, buttons for everyday items, looks great on the street."
"I have a great dealer, and I think once you drive "" them ""  a person will take a harder look at a Nissan"
"My biggest disappointment is that we were told by our salesperson that the Nissan App would work in this vehicle and having the ability to use the app to remote start from a distance was a huge ""want"" of mine and one of the reasons this car was purchased.  Only after the sale was final did I find out that the app was not available on this model.  That disappointment has clouded my opinion and buying experience overall."
The styling of the body and color of the interior.
"My previous comment answers the rating received.  My heart was set on the app being available and since it isn't, I am disappointed overall.  I specifically asked the salesperson if that app was available and was told yes, he even downloaded the app on  my phone, only to find out after the purchase, it was not available.  I maybe wouldn't recommend the dealership vs a Nissan in general, but have no experience with any other Nissan dealership."
"Great vehicle, no complaints"
"Gas mileage, the ride, and love the sunroof."
"Just love everything about it, and it looks great."
Wish it had larger cubbies in the front.  Better interaction with my Iphone 6.  (text capability)
The appearance
Same issues as before.  More cubby space and better connectivity with my Iphone.
back seats are not comfortable  wind noise...not as quite
exteria
doesn't  ride as smooth as other cars that I have had
"Interior lighting could be brighter. When pull to mailbox after dark and activate interior light to see, it's to dark to tell what's right outside door. Guess this is personal preference but last vehicle gave off enough light to see."
Quite ride on highway.
Limited warranty. Nissan should stand behind their vehicles for at least four years.
"I am used to more power when entering the highway. I expected more get up and go with a 6 cylinder opposed to my 4 cylinder. My husband says it sounds like the engine is struggling to keep up the amount of speed to get on the highway. Like a bunch of squirrels working their asses off on a stationary exercise wheel.  Sorry for the reference, but it's pretty accurate."
No power getting on the highway.
"A much better entertainment/navigation/bluetooth/phone-txt system and experience.  What is in the car ""looks"" good but performance is poor at best."
"Love the look, seats and driving experience."
"The vehicles technology interface, which is so vital for work and entertainment these days, is poor at best."
Already mentioned the problems.
The style outside.
It needs to have the items I mentioned changed for the better before I would give it a higher rating.
"Fix the dimness of the dash instrumentation which I mentioned before. If I get a warning in the daylight, chances are great I'll not be able to see it. I should be able to see the digital display on the dash as easily as I can see the map on the navigation system. Honestly, this is the biggest negative I have with this car. Drivers should be able to see those functions in broad, bright sunlight and I'm sure you would agree"
Interior appearance surpasses any other brand in its class   I have the white/light interior and that was the one thing I would not budge on when choosing my vehicle. Don't care for the gray or black interiors. Would like to see Nissan expand this option to other exterior colors
"Not my first Nissan. Had a Rogue before. Traded from a Mercedes and while you can't compare directly the two brands, Nissan came closest to pick up responsiveness when I needed it changing lanes, etc    I miss the sound system in the Mercedes and the CD function which allowed me to upload cd's so they didn't have to be stashed in the car.  Really a single CD for. a Murano Platinum with all the bells and whistles???? You guys can do better than that."
I love my new Murano. It's exactly what I wanted and it's a beautiful vehicle. I'm adjusting to the mpg's as I had a car prior to the Murano. Exceptional handling in the Colorado winter! I'm very satisfied!
It's beautiful and it handles exceptionally well in bad weather.
The staff at Valley Nissan was exceptional! Thank you Michael! My Murano is a beautiful and safe vehicle roomy enough for a family or to haul a purchase. I fit a 91/2 foot rug and a wing chair in the back of my Murano! Incredible room and a quiet cabin.
This is my forth Nissan and I am very very pleased with my purchase. I brings back excitement in driving again. I love my Murano.
Nissan to me is quality.
A hood redesign or some non reflective material put on the bend at the windshield end. Adjust the transmission response to engage with lower engine rpm. Install seatbelt adjuster at pillar so a lower belt position is available. Install additional panel light in rear storafge compartment.
Comfort overall is quite fine and has many fine interior features.Vehicle has a good high seating position for driver. Vehicle is relatively quiet and has comfortable ride.
Because of the shortcomings I have identified previously and the cost of vehicle relative to budget levels of friends.
"Due to the trouble I had in the beginning, I now live with the fear of having bought a lemon. The car handles very nicely and I love the look, hope the engine lives up to the rest of the car."
How the car handles and how comfortable is to drive.
I had a 2010 Murano that was a very reliable and the reason I bought the 2017 Murano. I never expected to have trouble right after my purchase of the 2017 Murano. Hopefully my difficulty in the beginning was just a fluke and will prove to be just as reliable as my prior Murano.
"Though vehicle is relatively quiet , could be a bit more in my opinion"
"Love all the features,touch screen,voice recognition hands free. Heated as well as cooled seats. Interior is beautiful color combination very luxurious  rear reclining seats push button for seats to fold down and pull back up space inside is very roomy  overall truly love this vehicle"
Have driven as well as driven inside numerous nissan vehicles.  Like overall quality and longevity of the products
"My biggest complaint is the rattle with the sunroof ... but I havent taken it in yet, because honestly I do not want to deal with the dealership.  My car was over a week late in delivery, no one could tell me where the car was but they were all happy to take my money for it.  I was promised $600.00 off the sticker price for the trouble and payment of my first loan payment ($541.00) by Nissan - neither of these promises were fulfilled.  The sales manager at Priority Nissan and the finance manager will not return my phone calls or emails.  This has truly lessoned experience.  I really do love my car, but this overall experience has been dreadful."
"it drives wonderfully, it is spacious and comfortable.  it is exactly what i wanted.  The only caveat was that the 2017 Nissan Murano's have the Apple Car feature, which mine did not come with  - that was a real bummer to be honest."
"due to the delivery experience and the lack of care for the customer that the sales manager at Priority Nissan showed.  He blamed my experience on Nissan as a company and did not take any ownership in the problems I had.  Because of this and the lack of response I have received from any one - I cannot recommend a company or dealership that treats its customers that way.  As much as I love my car, if I had not already paid for it, I would have bought a Kia."
"Looks, technology, safety"
all you could ask for in an SUV
Automatic seats and backup sound.
I love the color and the acceleration.
The sales person was patient and nice and my husband's infinity is awesome.
allow access to the navigation during driving mode. My wife likes to look up restr. and hotels when we are traveling or change locations of destinations and it won't allow us to do that. No mute control for radio???
The safety features are great. This car almost drives itself when on the interstate.
I love the ride and safety features.
I plan  to address the squeaking issue soon with the dealership. Hopefully the cause and cure will be handled to my satisfaction.
I love the looks and feel  of the vehicle. This is my second Murano.
See above
I like it looks and the operation of the navigation features.  Easy to use.
it was a fairly easy negotiation and the salesman and sales mgr. were very helpful
"Because I think it is an excellent car, but not necessarily ""outstanding""."
Right now I'm happy with my car.
We have more space
that's what I think
"For the price, it should have more automation and luxury. It is an over priced basic Murano. I do not like it."
The color.
"The dealership in Tampa tricked me into buying a $2000 appearance package. I test drove a SL and a SV model. So when we were talking I thought that was what I negotiated for but when I got the car it was a ""plain"" S model. When I asked the sales rep what the interest rate was he said, ""why?"". When I tried to talk to the general manager about the car, he was very rude to me"
Fix the paint and Bluetooth issues.
It drives very well and the seats are comfortable.
This is our 3rd Nissan.
"1) improve blind spots when turning corners.  2/ Go back to slanted dash board with dividers. Cannot place anything on dash without sliding off.  3/ Door storage bins are too shallow. Pretty much useless.  4) Outside mirrors face down when in reverse. Good feature if you want to see the ground, but not good to see what's further back."
"All around stylish, quality vehicle. Loaded with driving aids. Fun to drive."
"This is our second Murano and have actively promoted same among friends and family. 8 is a high rating in my mind, however there is always room for improvement."
"Driving comfort, auto cruise control, Collison braking and blind spot warning."
Best value and quality compared to other brands.
I love my vehicle.  I did have an issue with my drivers window not operating properly but Nissan dealer has since corrected by replacing the weather strip
"the wide stance, new look, technology"
"quality vehicle, 3rd Murano we have owned"
N/a
Comfort
I love mine
Still learning the navigation system.  Need to take some time to learn it better.
Great vehicle!  All Wheel Drive is fantastic in the snow and ice.  My wife feels safe driving this car.
I have had one issue and it has occurred only once. At some point both front windows rolled themselves down. The car was parked in the garage and it apparently happened overnight. They were rolled all the way down not partially.
Interior.
The interior.
"For the price, there are a LOT of missing items. 1. ability to set doors to auto lock when I get out after 15 seconds. 2. When playing music from USB, start where you left off, not all the way back to the beginning every time. (irritating)  3. Don't make me turn on cruise button every time I start car!  Just leave it on and allow me to just hit the set button.  4. Can't speak a text message - all canned msgs.  5. Navigation does not auto route based on traffic.  6. Boes sound system is just ok.  Does not sound that great.  Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of positives too!  Great look, 20"" tires, smooth/quiet ride."
"Look, smooth/quiet ride, 20"" tires.  The interior look sold me on this car.  I loved the ivory interior with the white woodgrain look.  Love the remote start."
"Because of all the things I mentioned and the warranty is just average.  Best in class is 100K miles.  I don't put enough miles on a car to be out of warranty after 3 years.  Also the same day I purchased car, I changed my mind and cancelled the extended warranty and maintenance pgm.  2 1/2 months later I still have not been reimbursed $4080.00.  Have called Finance Mgr 3 times and no return call to date 2.2.17"
Quality
Really nothing I can think of!
Smooth driving.....exceptional handling........just a winner!
Proven to built cars at high quality over the last 30+ years!
"I like the size of the vehicle, the comfort of the seats, and the technology features available."
"I am likely to recommend Nissan to a friend, however if they are looking for a vehicle with a little more luxury that has a quieter and smoother ride, I would recommend Lexus."
Smooth ride
Total satisfaction
would like to have better gas mileage
"room, color and drive"
good quality and smooth drive and comfort
"Put back the floor plate lights at the door thresholds. The 2016 had them and when we got our 2017, the lights were no longer available and we were a bit disappointed."
"We love the exterior copper color...so many of the other vehicle brands are more of an 'orange' color. I know that our car is considered 'orange', but it is not....it is more of a 'liquid copper' color, which I LOVE."
"It is one of the most advanced technological cars, as well as beautiful...and it does not cost as much as, say, the 'Infinity', which is a Nissan product too, and you end up paying much more just for the name. We know, as we had an Infinity for years."
The turning ratio is terrible
Comfort and feel
"Mostly handles very good on the road, however it has a terrible turning ratio"
BLUETOOTH issue and Use of APPS.
"Drives NICE, Looks NICE."
minor annoying issues.
Seat belt don't fit snug or comfortable
The interior and comfort
Very happy with vehicle so far
handling
price
I previous
"I previously had a 2009 Murano, I liked that center console better. I do not like the lift out tray in the model"
The shape and style
The SUV is exceptional
love this car
"roomy, pick up, exterior"
this is my 4th nissan - love the company
Navigation could be more user friendly and quicker to reroute. Visability is limited with sidebars in front and rear. Cup holders are not large enough in doors. Console in center has very little storage space. Garage door remote difficult to sync. The blind spot alert bell needs to be louder volume.
Overall appearance- exterior and interior.
Good quality and some nice features
My only issue is the rear view mirrors moving when in Reverse...very distracting.
The overall appearance...inside and out!
This is my first Nissan and I have been very pleased with the vehicle so I have recommended to my friends already.
"I feel the carpet in the new 2017 Murano is very thin.  A piece under the driver's seat was hanging down when we picked it up (they fixed it)  Also the carpet was either cut short or wrong because under the front passenger side it drops down and has to be ""tucked"" in every once in a while."
Love the ride and style of the Murano.  Glad we were able to pick the dark interior instead of the usual beige.  Nice smooth ride and love all the cameras.
Nissan has proven to be very dependable and love the look of them too.  Nissan is all we drive and now our Granddaughter is a proud owner of a Nissan too!
FOR WHAT WE PAID....I WOULD EXPECT THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT SEAT TO HAVE THE SAME ADJUSTMENTS AS THE DRIVERS SIDE FRONT SEAT
ELECTRONIC ...GEEK ITEMS
SEAT REMARKS
The appearance
We just love it.
Well if the issues that I mentioned earlier could be rectify that would please me I have not brought it up to Nissan or the dealership because I have not yet been for the first maintenance
I like the fact that into thousand 17 the Murano finally change its overall look.
Because basically the only model that I like is the Murano of all the Nissan line so I don't want to be so quick add recommending a brand just because of a particular model.
Back seat leg room could be improved.
"Engine, trany and overall handling and it's quite."
Great car
Its every thing I expected.
to be able to talk with hands still on steering wheel.
It has everything I wanted in a car
"Roominess , quick response, comfort."
I am very happy with my Murano & would recommend it to others.
"The left side of the console, it is uncomfortable when my right leg is against it when i use the accelerator. On a long trip it is fine because i use the cruise control, but other than that all is great."
"comfort, appearance, power"
Owned a lot of them.
Customer service from dealership
My vehicle is brand new  so far I luv it and can't thinkle of any improvement at this time
"My vehicle is new, at this time I can't think of any improvements"
Because I luv my new Nissan and haven't had any issues with it.
Nice car??
Seemless purchase and great driving vehicle
need the visor extension which has been elimated. The checker on the windshield does not block the sun later in the day. Why was the overdrive done away with?
It's ride and the transmission.
A very good form of transportation. Past experience with my previous cars I would recommend them highly
"Sometimes it is difficult to find, in the user manual, exactly what I am looking for.  I am still figuring out all the commands."
"Ease of entry.  Quietness, fuel economy, looks good, drives very good."
"suppose if I am this happy with my Nissan, everyone else would lio\ke it also."
Just would like a better warning alert system. Also more variety in seat height postion.
How it handles whilet driving
Because of reasons explained earlier. Especially the warning alert.
Not to long ago I had a Nissan Pathfinder lease from the company I work for.  That vehicle with under 4 mile already smell like coolant when the engine reach normal operating temperatures. Now the vehicle we bought from Nissan is under 4000 miles and I started to smell the same thing.  Is this a defect or recall issue?
Is to early to determine the reliability of the vehicle.
Not enough cup holders for front passengers.
Only owned a Nissan for two months with no prior experience.
"More rear seat legroom. Also, I need ski racks but you can't get racks from Nissan if you have the Tech Package/ Moon roof. Had I known, I might have bought a Toyota. We now carry our skies in the car. Horrible!!!!"
Appearance and finish
Ski racks cannot be fit to the car.
seats
The car is mostly same as most others just some items I like that other people my not
Excellent reliability based upon prior ownership experience and helpfulness of the Nissan Area Representative when we did have a transmission issue with our 2005 Pathfinder. Excellent customer service.
Fix technology problems. Visibility sucks. Glare off of roof into drivers eyes can be pretty bad. Redesign the hood
Quiet ride. Appearance. More technology than my last car
Technology could be easier. Fix hood of car because of blinding glare. Visibilty
It was great
Fix app connection   Offer lane departure and perimeter sensors.  Higher clearance on the bumpers.
"Comfy seats!  Good navigation features (center display, etc.)"
"I had a 2014 Jeep Cherokee which had many more safety and convenience features (auto high-beams, auto wipers, proximity alarms, auto parking, auto start-from app, fold down front seat, etc.) for a cheaper price. Aside from the more comfortable seats, and a few more navigation and interface features, I miss many of the features I had in the Cherokee."
This is my fifth Nissan.  Love it
All the extras   Esp the cruise control
"Great product.  Good history for maintence.  I also have a 1994 300ZX with 105,000 miles.  Runs like new."
"I love my Nissan Maurano, it is the best choice that I made. It's roomy, and comfortable. You have good leg room space for passengers."
"It runs quietly, and there is a lot of space in your trunk for groceries."
You are sure noticed when you drive it.
Everything
We have had a lot of new cars.  Nissan is the best one ever.
Nissan connect is not user friendly. Still haven't figured out how to fast forward or rewind through a single song. Would benefit from a printed manual
Styling of interior
This is my 4th Nissan and I have NEVER had a significant issue with any of the vehicles.
"The glove compartment is huge.  Whereas this is not a problem, it is at night when you are trying to find something since the interior is black.  A light inside the glove compartment would be a definite feature that would be appreciated."
The roominess of the storage area when the seats are down is very nice.  The overall interior is really nice.  I like the black and brown together.
"Overall, I just like the car, it's features, and how it rides."
"This vehicle is an upgrade from my past vehicle in terms of reliability , fuel economy, comforts and style."
i have recommended Nissan to friends and family
cheaper car note( LOL!!)
LOVE MY NEW VEHICLE!! BLESSED TO HAVE IT!
looks great rides great love it!!
D
slightly hard to maneuver and visibility which is common of larger vehicles
"nice design, technology and audio"
bluetooth reliability is important to my experience
Having the steering wheel warmer standard on the SLA would have been awesome.
The sleek look exterior and all of the interior features
I don't like recommending but if someone asked me how I like the murano then I would tell them about my experience with it
There isn't anything to be done to improve how I feel about my new Murano.
I like how comfortable and spacious the Murano is.
Nissan has very attractive vehicles which are very dependable and last forever if you stay on schedule with the suggested maintenance.
"I don't know of anything that can be done to improve how I feel about my Murano. I love everything about it...think it is my favorite car yet, and I have had lots of cars!!"
Love the way it drives and the way it looks!!
"This is actually my third Murano...had two Platinum models of the version before this.  Just before this Murano, I had an Edge for about a year and a half.  It was a good car, but doesn't really measure up to the Nissan Murano.  So glad to be back in the Nissan family. Probably won't leave it again."
Dealerships have indicated there is nothing they can do for the problem.
"I love the car. I like the way it looks and drives, but the noise is unacceptable. I would not recommend it for purchase to a friend."
I have owned two previous nissans with great service.  This one is brand new! It is so loud on the inside with wind noise till you cant hear yourself think sometimes. I would not recommend this vehicle to a friend till this issue is resolved.
We're more than okay with our new Murano - really pretty close to fine.
that it's an SUV and new.  Camera system is very good
"My ratings pretty well explain, but I've already recommended the Murano to a good friend."
"Passanger seat does not go u or down,  No electric mirrors  Blind side should be in mirror"
Smooth and even ride
Because of the previous answers
"This is my second Murano - my first was a 2009 and the 2017 is beautiful and I love it!  I have commented to friends and family that I do not know how Nissan could top this years model.  The Artic Blue is such a beautiful color, the lines look so good and the graphite interior sets it off.  I have found all Nissan's fit you like a glove when you sit or ride in one."
"The color, technology, braking if you get to close, blind spot indicators, overall cameras, I can go on and on."
"I love the vehicles - this is actually the 3rd verhicle I bought and my husbands 4th.  The dealership was great and the cars are built well, look nice and they are built to last."
"A few blind spots  A pillers a little ""thick"""
The look  Finish  Comfort seats
Of course the car is brand new  But if is as good as Nissan says it is & I expect it to be I will have it a long time & enjoy it  So if it's good to me I will recommend it
This is my third Murano.  Each year gets better
"Overall, we are very happy with the vehicle"
"Ride quality, comfort"
"We haven't owned the vehicle long enough to know if we will have any issues, but if all continues to go well then we will definitely recommend"
The advanced safety features.
I've had a previous Nissan vehicle for 10years without any major issues and very pleased with this one as well.
"I love my Murano! It drives more sportier than my Lincoln but is a nice ride. It would be nice to be able to text by voice command via an iPhone 6 or greater. The car system appears to offer this feature and it should work. This may be a carrier issue but this needs to be worked out at the manufacture level so as to be a safety feature. As of now, I pull my phone out and use Siri because the car system will not even send one of the predefined texts."
I Love the overall sportiness of the Murano. I LOVE the cockpit!!
"Overall I believe the Nissan Murano is a great vehicle for most people who are interested. Fix the text and phone connectivity and offer more apps, and then I will give a 10. A 9 is good in my opinion at this point."
give it a bit more power during acceleration
Design and overall confort
It is one of the best crossover I had test driven.   It is elegant and functional.
"As of now it would be the length of the seat belt connector and the raised portion of the front hood near the windshield, it should be lower."
"Style, seating, when you open the door the steering wheel and seat move out of position.  Heated seats and stearing wheel."
Good vehicle but there may be better options which I didn't check out.
"Reliability, and functionality"
Was a previous owner of a Murano and was completely pleased with all aspects of my 2011 Murano.
Comfort and new technology
It's a great vehicle.
It will be sweet if there is app to lock from the phone.
I love it
"Vehicle is perfect now.......check with me again after a few years of driving it.  I had a 2009 Nissan Murano before, and it was an outstanding vehicle!"
Great Engines!
"I love the way it drives, and minimum maintenance if you take care of the car!"
Not much...very nice vehicle...nicest I have owned....maybe offer a turbo 4 cylinder for better mileage vs having to go to hybrid option
"Ride quality, drive ability and styling"
Owned the vehicle over 2 months and not had one problem or even an unexpected rattle or noise
better gas millage
every thing This is my third Murano
I like it
"I only have about 1700 miles on the car so haven't brought it back yet for oil change, etc.  Will review radio issues at that time.  Overall, very satisfied with my Murano"
"Design, comfort, driveability.  It feels like a well built car."
This is our 3rd Nissan.  Never had one before we bought the last 3 cars.  They are well designed and built.  Very few issues.
Fix system to connect phone.
Seats and steering wheel heated
Not happy with phone situation.
Front fenders could be not elevated as high. Wish black on top of side rear was white as is balance of exterior color. Seems temp not even when turn on heat to floor & mid level; fan lowers when change from just floor heat.
"Pearlescent interior, electronic conveniences, collision avoidance when cruising behind other vehicles, contemporary style."
Dealership outstanding for sales personnel & service. Overall pleasure with my 2017 Murano SL style & performance so far.
Better fuel economy.
"Looks sporty, like AWD, electronics, feels solid on the road."
Good technology for the price
At this time I am 100% satisfied with my Nissan Murano.
I love the comfort of the seats and the overall ease of handling. The warranty is also great.
I love my Murano and I also appreciate the dealership's (salesman) expertise and professionalism.
There is a random glitch with bluetooth connection to my Galaxy S6 which is annoying.  I wish the front side windows were tinted a little darker.  But I LOVE my beautiful new car!!!
"The overall look of the vehicle and the comfort of the seats.  Of course, the technology is really cool too, auto braking, etc."
So far it's a wonderful experience!
Not a thing
Comfy ride and appearance
I drove a Honda/Acura for past 20 years so Nissan has a ways to go to measure up to my experience with Honda brand.
i really love Murano.
I had a great experience with my dealer and my rep.
"Maybe a little more space after second row.  Also still getting use to some blind spots when changing lanes, trying to see out of back side window."
The ride is smooth.  Vehicle is overall a nice size & height.  Still haven't taken it on a long trip yet .
Nissan are usually long term dependable vehicles .
The air controls provided to the rear seats could be improved to provide better control over the amount of air sent.
It has an exceptional smoothness in the ride. The seats are very comfortable. The central control and navigation system is very good. The orange color is outstanding.
A good vehicle with a comfortable ride and nice features.
would like a key pad to access car instead of a keyfob.  more storage under the seats.
excellent fuel mileage  excellent interior  interior lights in rear seats are nicely positioned for ease in seeing hanging clothes
expensive vehicle ...would like an app for the phone to start vehicle...lock vehicle
"Fix the seat issue I mentioned.  Move the seat control button to better location. Improve column between front & side window to lesson obstructive view.  Rear view isn't great either because of design. Move the garage opener to a better location. Add a hook to the side of console on passenger side for plastic bags, handbag handles, etc. to keep them from sliding around. My 2005 Lexus has itl"
"Two more improvements - an improved cargo net, see the Lexus net and the glove box could be deeper.  I like the entire illumination upon entering the vehicle. Easy infotainment system & dash computer system. The light color wood interior-doesn't show the dust. Front & back seat roominess and comfort..  Adjustable seat belt height. Fairly good gas mileage."
I don't know the reliability yet.  It will take a few years to come to that conclusion.
More features come standard.
Looks clean and drives very smooth
Great quality and engineering
Gas mileage in town needs improvement
Styling and cameras
Features and looks
"Nissan Connect is very user friendly.  Easy to learn, easy to operate."
This is vehicle is an exception value.
I don't feel like you get a lot of heat on the feet area.
I just love everything about my Murano.
I think it's a great car & ive already recommended it.
Bottom of interior on door could have protective material to avoid scuffing; also interior color on door threshold could  be dark rather than off white which would show less scuffing.
Handling and appearance.
Second Murano we have owned and are very impressed with car performance.
Larger rear view mirror and work on  phone connectivity issue.
"Roominess, design both inside and out and most features."
Great purchasing experience and overall comfort and design of the car.
The service was great other than the dealer had to bring my car from another dealer because the color i wanted was not available
The power
Nothing
It 's new
I'm used to driving a little bigger vehicle find that it's not as comfortable when going over bumps and trunk space is a lot less than what I'm used to
The Nissan Murano are pretty comfortable engine works pretty quiet the body looks very nice in my opinion it's very good nice car.
The car is very nice looking beautiful very comfortable
Safety features
"Appearance, comfort & safety features."
Because that is what it deserved.
"will check with tech,upon 1st oil change as to actual size of gas tank"
I like the driving position and the dashboard readouts and the all around camera
"Paid $50,000 for a vehicle I could not use"
"It's good car,  not great storage. Apple car play is an issue"
Will not get another one.
Seats
It was a downgrade in overall quality for me compared to what I had. And I buy brand new every other year.
I'm totally satisfied with my Murano experience.
Excellent operational performance and sharp looking curb appeal.
"I thoroughly researched the Murano and its comparable competition.  Based thereon, I targeted buying a Murano.  My family had prior purchases with this dealership, which was very positive.  I wanted to do business with the same salesman and his sales support team.  My oldest son drives a Rogue.  My middle son drives a Titan.  My youngest son drives a Frontier.  Now, I drive a Murano."
Only thing I would like to have  in this vehicle would be an automatic tailgate. This vehicle has a lot of  things that I always wanted in a vehicle except that automatic tailgate.  Also mats for the floor which I always had before in a vehicle could be used also.
The style and components in the vehicle which I never experienced.  This is a awesome vehicle.  I got many comments concerning this vehicle.
I had a Nissan for  10 years.  I can't get away from it.  It's like family to me.
This vehicle has a classy look..it looks better than the Lexus suv
"This is my first Nissan however I am very pleased with all aspects of the vehicle, as well as the buying experience at Hertrich Nissan of Dover Delaware.  We had looked at 2 other dealerships prior to going to Dover with very unpleasant experiences.  Especially . Porter Nissan"
Interior space
I have had good experience with both Infiniti and Nissan cars in the past.
I love my vehicle
Heated seats/steering wheel &a STARTING IT UP FROM THE INSIDE!!!!
"I've always owned Nissan vehicles except one time & it only lasted a year. I love the features Nissan vehicles have, very reliable & they last a long time"
Comfort  Interior
Loss of blue tooth connectivity  Controls for heated seats
Volume of sound system needs to b addressed when playing a cd
How responsive & fun it is to drive
Great value
The roaring at 50 to 60 mh
Easy driving.
Ease and comfort.
More storage and cup holders.
Electronics and leather coloring.
I have only had the car for three months dont know how dependable it is yet.
love the interior and exterior
love the vehicle so far
"The interior could have a little less plastic.  The ""faux"" trim is really faux.    The driver's area feels a small.  My previous Murano (a 2012) seemed more roomy."
The overall ride and comfort.
I'd really recommend any Nissan.  The exact model is a personal preference.
I would ask for taking this particular vehicle to be destroyed and build a whole new one. This car was the biggest disappointment an a lost a huge amount of money in buying and selling it with 400 miles due to NISSAN's incompetence and moreover to the dishonest attitude towards their clients. How can you possibly fix it ??? Getting OUT of the car market!!!
I've already did!! My car was sold with 400 miles ... so much trouble and disheartening it has caused with a problem unacceptable for a brand new car - particularly a MURANO PLATINUM 20-17 !! Problem that was NEVER fixed and probably will never BE!!! I am really sorry ... after 14 years driving Nissans ... my confidence and reliability on Nissan have been totally gone. Just be more honest and FIX what you are responsible for!
"Improve the navigation software and the bluetooth reliability. Also, for the outside it would be nice not to have the plastic bumper."
I love the beauty of the interior and that it drives smoothly.
because of the little issues with the reliability of the navigation system and the bluetooth connection.
Correct problems identified.
Poor dealership responses to problems.
No other issues.
Interior style.
A 10 would mean the car and the company are perfect. Nothing is perfect.
"I cannot stop thinking I was ""had"" by the management and sales-staff.  I pay much, much more than if I HAD PURCHASED FROM ONE or two other dealers.  How much? m $6,000."
"Just because, but not from the dealer I bought my from"
Great vehicle great dealership
Love my new murano even better than the last one
"The styling, the roominess and ease of handling"
Nothing is perfect
"Style, drive, performance"
"Excellent brand, great product for the money"
Looks sharp.
I love my car.
It is a nice vehicle
"I would have liked the window sticker with the equipment,safety items that  car came with listed.all other car& trucks I have owned I had when I traded."
"Size ride quality,power"
Owned a2010 loved it.
Rearview mirror visibility is minimal.  Also rearview mirror at night is extremely dark (? reduce glass tint?)
"Size, Comfort, Highway fuel economy"
Overall best vehicle I've ever owned.
"Hood glare, vent bezels colored dark, intelligent cruise able to disengaged, I wish under body ground lighting was available, the Location of the climate control knobs for seats are in a bad location, especially with a cup in the holder. A lever instead strap to decline rear seat. I'm not being a complainer, just giving details for improvement. I actually sell these Nissans and I'm always looking to improve so they sell better."
"Seats, style, power, comfort"
"I sell them, they are awesome value"
Cheaper note heated steering
Don't really have a favorite
I have two Nissan's one is a 2011 Maxima and the windshield leaks plus they stuck me with it knowing I can't pay it off without penalties. Nissan is not my favorite
Things are OK!
"Looks, drive and ride."
Don't know what it's like to drive a high end car!
Even though I rated the seat comfort a 10 the back seats could use some Improvement in being able to adjust the seat back.
"I really like the side traffic warning lights and alarm, camera front and back, and the auto speed adjust when using cruise control."
One of the best vehicles I have purchased.
"So far, having only owned the vehicle a couple months, I cannot think of a thing to improve upon my Murano. I absolutely love everything about it!"
"I love the appearance, both in and out, the quality of product for the price paid, and the technological features for my particular model, Platinum."
"So far, it has proven to be an extremely high-end, quality manufacturer that is just as nice if not better than true luxury vehicles without the inflated pricing."
Heated seats
Nice car
Nothing I love it
Smooth ride and drives really nice
Had a good experience with staff and love the vehicle
Good thanks soo much
Yes
"i love the car, it's just not perfect and after driving you notice some things that prevent a 10 rating. It does have interior noise, poor storage compartments, and a few other things that could be improved but the major things are great so far. I don't have that many miles yet so time will tell~"
"Excellent dash with dials/buttons too. LOVE the navigation system, very intuitive.  Attractive vehicle, love the safety features (side warnings, break warnings,  cameras). some I didn't know I would even like."
"Because I think it has excellent features and drives nicely. IF someone can afford all the bells and whistles I have, it is a fantastic vehicle with great safety features."
We have had an extreme problem with our front leather seats !!!!!
"This is our 3rd murano from the Briggs dealership in Lawrence, Ks. And we are sooooooo frustrated w/ the problem w/ the 2 front seats.  We really believe there is something wrong with the leather ."
"We bought our 3rd Murano from the Lawrence dealership and gave been so frustrated and upset about the way our clothing adheres to the leather seats.  We have been back to the Lawrence dealership at least 5 times.  They kept trying to fix the problem, but it keeps returning.  Finally, we had enough!  If we had not demanded new seats I doubt if they would have given them to us .  At this time we are waiting for a call from them that our new seats have arrived.  However, this is now 2 weeks later than we thought."
Better gas mileage
"Size, not too large or too small"
"Love the dealership that I work with, Nissan of Omaha. And really love the CVT"
The navigation will tell me to take some some ridiculous turns that I know cannot be right.
I like it
Appearance
Great deal good quality vehicle
All models should come with roof rails! We thought we could add them and we're told it had to come from factory with them. Very disappointed by this!
Safe and drives well.
Reliable and safe. I would recommend they ensure the model they choose has everything they want so they don't end up like us in the case of no roof rails.
Tint front windows
The smooth ride
Exceptionally professional
"The problem with the cell phone, the cheap looking interior metal on the door panels, and the wheels are my only negatives. It's a great driving vehicle."
The driving experience.
I don't know.
I would like actual arm rests instead of the big console between the seats. The power port poor location inside the compartment is inconvenient and hard to plug in a cord.
"All of the safety features, i.e. blind spot indicator, the way the cruise control works, all the air bags."
"There are a couple of things I indicated that prevent me from giving a 10 rating, but I really like the vehicle a lot."
"overall style, ease of entry/eixt"
"This is second Nissan (first is 2015 Rogue). overall sales, service seem to be above average."
I would if brought up.
"Fix the glare/reflection in the rear view mirrors  Have a seat belt warring signal  QUESTION !!!  Why on a car that has so many wonderful features, it does not include automatic windshield wipers ( my fault for not making sure this was on the vehicle)..."
"Looks, leg room, features, size ....love so much about the car but would like to see  my concerns addressed....."
Like the car but would tell them about the items I have concerns with ( which I covered in this survey)...
Everything
Every
"The steering wheel hurts my hands. I like to hold at the bottom & the molded plastic edge is sharp. I wish there was a dedicated coin collection area. I think the warning, for the door open in park, is extreme. Sometimes the phone is really loud. Comes & goes. Also, I don't like how all the doors unlock when I put in park. Also some of the features for the phone don't work with my iPhone. I am very disappointed by that."
The wood trim is beautiful. That's why I picked it.
So far it's been a great experience.
I think that the metal accents on the interior trim could be more subtle.
"Amazingly quite, comfortable ride. Awesome technology. New Murano has improved mileage."
I have had a good experience with past Nissan and feel it is a great car.
Everything this is great. Maybe back seat climate control would be awesome
AC driver seat
I had a Nissan rouge before this and it was the most reliable vehicle i have ever owned. So I will continue with Nissan
It's great car maybe needs less noise for heater and also noise absorbtion when driving on bumpy roads
Confort style great for long distance ride
Great car comfortable car all around
"Nothing, I love my vehicle"
"Have always driven a car, so I like that I sit higher, I feel protected in a larger vehicle"
"I've only ever driven Nissans (Altima, Altima, Maxima, Murano)"
"great vehicle, I enjoy driving it."
Smooth ride
smooth ride quiet engine great appearance
I love my car
Quality and style
Dependable car besides of its style and durability.
A bit disappointed that a part on the undercarriage feel off
Safety and comfortable
"Sorry, I miss my Honda."
We are very happy with our Murano!!
Comfort of ride
If we went to higher # people might think we were not paying attention to the questions.Keeping it at 7 tells us and you how we really feel. It's best to be honest. The only perfect one is Jesus and God!
In regard to the storage I don't see a lot being able to be done. If you add more space to the back then you would be taking away from the roominess of the backseats. I would rather my passengers be comfortable and just have to pack creatively than to give that up. As for the radio I just think the speakers are average. I actually felt my speakers in my Dodge Neon produced a better and louder sound.
It's hard for me to pick one thing. I think it is a very classy looking car both inside and out. It's a very smooth and quiet ride. I love how sturdy the car feels when I drive it or when I am the passenger. I also love how comfortable it is. It is roomy and the seats are very comfortable. It's just really an all around nice car and I'm very pleased with my purchase.
"It's two fold for me. In regard to my car and how it handles and looks I couldn't be happier and I would recommend this particular car to others. My niece leased the Rogue a few months earlier and she loves her car too. As I said previously, it's a classy looking car but still sturdy and it handles really well. It's something I feel comfortable taking my customers out in because of the quality of the car both in looks and safety. The other reason I would recommend Nissan is because of the way the sale was handled. The two people I worked with never made me feel like I was being strong armed into anything. The gentleman (I can't remember if his name is PK or KP) was a good salesman in that he was able to push the sale along and keep me interested but he did it in a way that was more of a fun banter and not an aggressive, irritating pushy way. I went to Kia as well and I was actually pretty set on buying the Sorento. But my experience at Kia was terrible. They wanted to run my credit before they would even give me an idea of what numbers they could work with. I refused, walked out of the dealership, and went to Nissan and bought my car. I won't work with people that treat me that way when I am spending that much money with them. And Nissan didn't do that to me. Also, the only reason I had considered checking out Nissan is because I liked how KP (PK?) and Maylan treated my niece during her transaction. It's what brought me to the Premier Dealership on Capitol Expressway to look at other cars. I hadn't even considered buying a Nissan until I went with her for her transaction. So good sales people that are respectful and treated me like a customer should be treated and a beautiful car. You can't beat that."
We like the car very much
Seats are very comfortable and the ride is great
"So far, it has been great"
"We had a 2015 Murano Platinum and I had no problem with the heating system, so I can't figure why I get cold air."
"love the safety features, especially the lane changing features and the distance control when in speed control."
;I had an issue with my 2015 Nissan Platinum with the passenger air bag light illuminating when ever it wanted to so I never knew if I had a functioning passenger airbag or not.  Nissan did a replacement and replaced the 2015 with a 2017.  The replacement went quite smoothly and I was very pleased.
"I truly love my new Murano.  Three wishes--wish for better in town gas mileage, wish for lane departure warning and wish to be able to send text replies."
Compared to my 2014 Pathfinder the Murano is a dream!!
I have dealt with Valley Nissan and your corporate customer service representatives.
Great service/car
Nothing.  Outstanding vehicle.
"Styling, Safety features, Fuel economy, interior."
"Product, sales and service excellent."
Everything
"Because it's a nice car, I feel secure driving it"
The drive and comfortable interior
Every thing! I love it!
"It's an excellent vehicle. Looks,performance,everything."
"I have only had my Murano two months and am still getting acclimated to the various functions and technological features.  So far, I have no complaints or recommendations to make.  But, if something occurs going forward, I'll let you know."
"One of my most favorite features is the automatic liftgate.  My upper arm strength isn't the greatest, so this is a truly valuable feature for me.  Also, now that I'm becoming accustomed to it, the ability to communicate via my cell phone through the car's dashboard is fantastic!!  The safety features, like the intelligent cruise control are wonderful (still getting adjusted to that) and the side, front and rear proximity indicators are very useful in high traffic situations.  It's a smooth and quiet ride and the interior is quite comfortable for my family."
"With all of the comforts and safety features in my Murano, I'm recommending it to family and friends who are looking for a vehicle with these good quality items.  The folks whom I've taken for rides in the Murano are all impressed with the overall features and the interior/exterior appearance.  I'm highly satisfied with my choice and, as time goes on, am looking forward to an ongoing wonderful driving experience with my Murano."
"I am satisfied, thankful and blessed with the vehicle"
I purchased my 2017 murano in December and It looks like my tires are red threading and this shouldn't be that way.   I'll will make an appointment with you today in fayvetteville.nc
This is my first SUV and i love it but I need to check those tires
It's a great vehicle  with lot's of room it just comfortable
exceptional car and quality
Everyone does not like cvt transmission operation.
Nothing. I love my Murano.
The comfort of the seating.
The sales experience was awesome. The service has been excellent. The Murano is exactly what I'd hoped for.
"comfort, stability, performance on the highway, safety features for passing drivers"
quality of the vehicle
larger front seats and more leg room
the handleing
excellent value
I would have liked to have had the option of thigh support extensions similar to that on the drivers seat of the Maxima.
The vehicle just suits me very well.  The vehicle/driving height while maintaining a very quiet and comfortable interior is exceptional.
I'm very pleased with the quality and design for the amount I'd spent for the vehicle.
"Wish my Murano SL had ""cross traffic alert signal"", something I really wanted and did not notice was lacking when I decided on the car. Do wish it had been detailed before delivery to me as it was a lot of work for me to get hard water spots off of windows and sun roof glass.  Not at all impressed with the Century Nissan dealership and wish that I had gone to another Nissan dealer for the car."
The ride comfort and handling is exceptional.
Because of the difficult rear vision and extreme slope of front & back windows.
Love it no recommendations
Comfortable
Lov all Nissan vehicles we have owned
Exterior looks.
less engine noise.
all the standard features
"overall satisfaction with multiple models, titan altima etc."
Great Sales and Finance staff
"Better quality control of door gaps and alignment with body...  I have neve bought Nissan before usually buy Toyota and you would never see this on a Toyota Highlander, or RAV 4...."
styling and interior...seats and sound system are OUTSTANDING!!!!!!
I like the styling and fuel mileage> The v6 has great power and good mileage...
"better/easier steering, might be oversized tires.  When looking to buy, did not know the 2017 did not have the apple play installed until 2017.5.  kinda misleading.  And I still do not understand why apple play can not be installed as a software upgrade????????????????????????????????????????????????????"
The wife is happy
"disappointment in not having the apple car play, one of the reason to buy.  And we gave up a vehicle that had much more features, auto windshield wipers, auto bright lights, lane departure warning....."
"Please see my previous recommendation about re-locating the seat pre-position selection buttons, or raise the roof a bit or somehow make it easier to get into the drivers seat, particularly after a smaller person has previously been driving the car."
I love everything about it except the difficulty of getting into the drivers seat after a smaller person has been previously driving the car.
I love the car.
I like my Murano however I have not driven it much to give an accurate assessment.
"I like the exterior design, the features, and the height."
"I have two Nissan's a Murano and a Altima, I am well pleased with both."
"There is a small storage compartment located directly in front of the driver's armrest.  It opens toward the driver making it difficult to access the interior of the compartment; for this reason I do not use it.  In future designs, it would be better to design the compartment in such a way that its lid opens away from the driver."
I like the plush interior.
"I think it is a very good vehicle and I am pleased with it.  However, I have since read many reports on older Muranos that question their reliability.  In fact I read one report that stated the Murano is the second most expensive vehicle to maintain over a 10 year period.  It was even more expensive than a Mercedes E350.  This information would give me some hesitation in recommending the vehicle."
Cruise disengagement when something is on sensor
Overall quality and ride
Love the car
Our third Murano with no issues
CHANGE WIPERS AND TOO MANY  BLIND SPOTS AND FRONT WINDOW WIPERS DOESNT COVER TOP RIGHT WINDOW. ANNOYING WHEN ITS DIRTY AND WIPERS WONT REACH
THE SMOOTH RIDE
Appearance
Dealing with Nissan customer service is a hassle
More cargo room.  Stronger LED lights
"lines, speed, interior and exterior."
its been a reliable car.  This is my 4th Murano
Only issue I don't like is the heating. When I have the mode to my feet and defrost. My feet are freezing I have to switch back and forth
The drive. I like that it's heavy. I feel safe
Nissan is reliable car
I love my vehicle!
The styling and technology are so cool.
This is my 5th Nissan.  I have had no issues.  All I basically do is change the oil and rotate the tires.
Have no suggestions as I am  very pleased with my Murano.
How it drives and love the 360 camera view.
This is my fourth Nissan and my second Murano.  I have been happy with all the models I have had and am one to keep a car for sometime which has ranged between 7 and 10 years.
"Better seats and more comfortable, seat coolers like the seat heaters, phone should always connect to system not just sometimes."
The drive.
I would warn any referral to Nissan about the seats and Bluetooth connectivity. But overall an ok vehicle.
Wouldn't change a thing
It's a Nissan and its an SUV
"We've had Nissans for over 20 years. Have owned a Ford van, a Mazda sedan and a sports car, a few Hondas, Nissan is a user friendly high quality vehicle and we always get our money's worth"
I think the engine is too big which causes the car to consume lots of gas
"The seats are very comfortable, the sound system and the navigation"
Because the guy from the financing was a jerk when I cancelled the the extended warranty that I purchased.
"MAKING SURE MY SALESMAN DEVON IN FAYETTEVILLE, ARKANSAS GETS 200% CREDIT FOR AMAZING DAY"
FEELS SLEEK AND EXPENSIVE
"FIRSTLY, MY SALES TEAM DEVON IN FAYETTEVILLE, ARKANSAS MADE PURCHASE SMOOTH AND ENJOYABLE.  I WAS THERE UNTIL CLOSING!   (SO WERE THEY!)"
"It my wife car and I drive a Ford truck that is more comfortable to me. It harder to see over the hood unless to raise the seat to the highest level. I am 5'6"""
My wife is happy with it.
I always buy American products and vehicles
Better sound control buttons on steering wheel.  They are too small and too remove.  A little better storage in the front.
"Driveability, styling, auto temp. control, sound.  Most everything."
"Very high quality vehicle, very well designed."
So far everything
Good quality car
Increase horsepower to 290
technology features
aggressive styling and innovative technology
"improve the navigation voice recognition, cleaner user interface of technology.  The new Volvo SUV had a much cleaner technology interface."
Appearance
I bought the new 2017 Murano vs the 2016 hoping that the Navigation system and technology package would be an improvement.  I'm disappointed with connectivity and tedious voice commands needed to simply get direction or dial phone numbers.
The vehicle is great.
How it handles while I am driving.
Thank is my second Nissan and both are excellent vehicles. The other is a Maxima.We used the same outstanding dealer.
"Better cup holder on doors, other than that great SUV"
Overall look and quality
Great Value and Great Look
"Honestly, I cannot think of anything right now.  Thank you!"
"I've never ""owned"" an SUV in the past....this is my first one and it's AWESOME!"
'nuff said!   :-)
Seems to take a while to heat up. The driver and passengers are could for what seems to be a long time. My Rave4 for warms up very quickly. Also the distribution of the heat in the seats is not right it seems warm in spots not a total distribution. I had a Jeep and the leather seats were like easy chairs and the entire seat was warm.
"Read my other survey. The dealership sales director and the ""finance person both blatantly lied to me. I warn everyone."
appearance and power
It has enough good qualities that anyone buying it would enjoy the car
"I live in Pennsylvania, so winter driving is a must.  We noticed right away that the plastic wheel well protectors are damaged from anti skid chipping away at it. The material seems to be too soft."
All those technology features that make it so nice to take on a trip.
I decided to look at the Nissan Murano because I knew I wanted a cross over vehicle again.  Nissan is the only good looking one with decent mpg. We also own a Nissan Altima.  I have already recommended a Nissan to a friend who was looking for a new vehicle.
reliable and good looking vehicles
I would have like to see the iPod port moved to inside the center console.  Trunk storage could be better.
I love the styling of the vehicle and all the tech package!
"I practically grew up in the Nissan dealership in Jacksonville, NC.  My father has been with the dealership since the 80's.  My very first car was a 94 Nissan Pathfinder.  Nissan's will run forever if you take care of them!"
"The voice recognition is not very good, doesn't seem to understand what I'm saying most of the time."
Comfort and safety features.
This is my 2nd Murano.  I drove my last one for 10 years with very few problems.  It is a reliable and durable vehicle.
Awesome vehicle
I really liked the grocery bag dividers in the back of  my 2009 Murano and miss them in my 2017 Murano.
the styling and technology package
I like the styling and all of the features.
I need to move up to a model with more features. I wish the rear cargo shade covered a bigger area when the rear seats are flat.
"Styling, ride comfort"
very good quality and reliability. Design and style are very good.
"It's a stunning vehicle, inside and out - the annoyances I've experienced are not earth shattering...just nit picky things because the rest of the vehicle is so stunning.  If the navigation could be programmed to show ETA (rather than travel time to destination) it would be much more helpful.  I don't want to calculate my ETA while driving...I want to look once and see if I'm late or on-time.  Light on heated/cooled seats should be red/blue like the Ford system.  Nissan apps are worthless, connectivity to the system is a joke, and there are very few offerings.  In a technology driven world, this needs to improve or Nissan is going to be left behind.  Cheaper Chevy and Ford models have superior technology interface."
Cashmere interior is stunning and it looks very unique
"I would recommend the Murano, but not some of the other vehicles in the line that I have driven as rental cars.  I travel a lot for work and depending on the class of vehicle I rent I often request ""not a Nissan"" due to the lack of simple iphone and tech connectivity."
I love my Murano....only rated 9s because there's always something that can be improved...nothing is perfect...but my Murano come darn close:)
The Sound System and the smell.....just love the car!!
"We just love Nissan...i was driving Datsun's before they were Nissan...don't know why, just love them."
Overall the car is great. I should have done more research on the differences between the models that were available.
The quality control on everything is excellent.
The experience so far in owning this vehicle deserves a 10.
Nissan Murano is 100% good.
"it's my favorite car, is spacious and comfortable"
Only thing that concerns me even a little bit is the gear shift in the consule  im always afraid ill bumps it and it will come out of gear. Can that happen while driving?
I love it all very pleased
"Great mid size SUV, easy to drive easy to park"
Love it!
So comfortable to drive
Such a great car
This is our 8th Nissan and 2nd Murano. The new design brought me back as I did not feel like I was driving a soccer mom vehicle anymore. The light bamboo interior trim was a game changer and is very appealing. I really don't know what is needed to improve your already improved vehicle.
The new interior trim
We bought this Nissan at a great dealerships. Not only would I recommend a Nissan but this dealership in particular is why we bought another. We were considering another Cadillac   Your short videos explaining the features of the vehicle is excellent
No Problems at all.
It's new.
It's my 4th one and I'm happy with the product
The only downside is leg room in the back and separate climate control for back seating.
"Comfort, reliability and safety features."
I've had Nissan's in the past and are one of my favorite.
Fix problems before the vehicle is sold to the customer!
Clean and sleek
"At this time, I am a little annoyed because I have a new vehicle with less than 6000 miles and already having issues."
na
fix the iphone 7 issue
"the look, the way it handles, the comfort"
enjoyed it so far
Nothing at this stage. I am still getting used to it and all the technology. I only have 1800 miles on the vehicle.
"The drive, the comfort, the look, the technology"
I think the vehicle is a great product and several of my friends are jealous and really like it. I have already had a couple of friends mention they are going to look at them for their next vehicle.
"I have owned a 2003, 2009 and now a 2017 Murano and love them all.  I believe my '09 and '17 Murano are on par with luxury brands.  I appreciate the opportunity to express my thoughts on possible improvements to this vehicle."
Best luxury style vehicle for the money.  The only thing you get better on a Lexus or Mercedes is the badge.  Along with the badge you get a price tag at least $10K higher.  The reliability of my Muranos has obviously been a loyalty generator.  Outside-the-box styling...getting away from the boxy look that persist in most crossovers.
"I would definitely recommend the Murano.  I feel the Murano is the flagship of the Nissan line.    I know that Nissan suffers some issues in some other models and not knowing what model the person might be interested in, that may affect my fervor in recommending Nissan to a friend."
nothing - love it
the way it looks and drives
good quality product
Heated stirring wheel is the one thing I miss. I have a pretty loaded up vehicle and maybe it is available and I just didn't get it.
I like everything about the vehicle
"I haven't had the vehicle long so this could change in the course of the lease but seems to be top of the line in quality, features, safety and appearance."
I'm pretty happy with everything on my vehicle.
appearance and performance of the vehicle
This is the 5th Nissan vehicle I have owned and I have been very satisfied with all of them.
Can't think of anything right now
Remote starter
Love Nissan Vehicle's
The car need no improvement.
The sturdiness of the vehicle.
"The salesman, Jerry Smith, was exceedingly good in helping us to obtain the  vehicle of our choice.  He did not hesitate to look until he finally came across a Murano to  our liking."
The back seats are very uncomfortable.  The car needs to be about one foot wider. Car drives very well--seats could be more comfortable-especially the rear   seats.
Easy to handle
When sitting in the back seat-rough riding and about ft. to small for comfort
Everything
I love my Nissan. It's a great choice
Very happy with the vehicle.
When air bags deployed on my last Nissan Murano it caused a high pitched ringing in my ears. Please research improvements on this issue.
The elagance of the cashmere in the inside of the vehicle.
Great vehicle
Nothing - I absolutely love my Murano.  Drives like a dream.
"It's quiet.  Oh, and the steering wheel warmer is the best invention EVER!!!"
"I've already recommended it to several - it's one of the nicest, quietest and easiest driving vehicles I've ever owned."
Add power front passenger seat.  The car has front accident prevention warning. Add emergency stop.  This is my  third Murano and is the best one yet.
This is my Third Murano and my family's 12th or 13th Nissan all bought or leased new.  Customer service is also  one of the reasons I recommend Nissan.  '
Electronic features
Reliability. Style
Add storage in cargo area.
Truly best car we have had . I love it!
I believe the features and design of the Murano are exceptional.
"#1 - a better buying experience would have started off with a more positive feeling about the car  #2 - the feel of the cockpit - little things like the rough edge of the steering wheel  that makes it uncomfortable to rest your hand make the car seem unfinished and not as comfortable; also lacks logical controls on the steering wheel (I much prefer the controls on our Chevy 2500)  #3 - I HATE the two separate buttons to engage cruise control - first having to turn cruise control on every time I start the car, and then the Set to engage the cruise control.  My '07 Xterra had a single button for the cruise ""on/off""- I pushed it once 10 years ago, this was much better.  #4 - better information on what the car included.  Being assured my vehicle worked with the app for remote start, etc. and finding out my vehicle was not equipped after I got it home was very disappointing."
"Good looks, comfortable to drive, nice features at a decent price point."
"I loved my Xterra, the Murano is good so far, other friends and family have had great experiences."
The comfort of the seats.
Really can't believe that a car like this doesn't have front parking sensors. Should be standard.
It is great maybe make the stereo a little more powerful
I love all of the hands free stuff
Because I love my car
Haven't been able to take on any long trips yet so don't know yet
"It could use more useful storage in the doors and center consul. My last vehicle was a Toyota Venza and I really miss the storage areas. Granted the glove compartment is huge in the Murano, but it can get a bit cluttered and hard to find things.  It could use a light. A lumbar control in the passenger seat would also be nice. I'm still not convinced the CVT is the best choice, but it is impressive with the low RPM's."
The styling is fantastic and way ahead of the competition.  My wife wanted a Lexus RX but this car delivers everything the Lexus does at a much cheaper price.
It simply delivers it all at a reasonable price.
Love the car
Feels and drives like a luxury vehicle without the luxury vehicle price
Have owned Nissan vehichles since 2009 and extremely pleased with performance
"Nothing, I like my car."
Everything.
I've driven a few SUVs and I LIKE NISSAN'S  .
The passenger seat needs to be able to raise for short passengers :)
"The agility, power, & looks fantastic"
This is the best car that I have ever owned. I absolutely love it!
"Look, comfort"
"Never had a Nissan before, so I have to see how I like it"
"Back doors could open wider,when front doors are open,very far to reach out for to close them"
Very nice to drive
Just a great driving car
Overall the car is what I expected. I think the instrument panel is a bit hard to read in full sunlight but  I can live with it. When I washed the car I wished the back window opened so I could clean better. I may also be nice to have a sprayer in the back to help when the windows are dirty.
the comfort of the drive and the interior
Always room for improvement
"The interior and exterior colors are just what I wanted. I love the features such as the back up camera, blind spot indication, remote start,etc."
There is always room for improvement. I would have to be blown away to rate anything a 10 on a scale of 1-10.
We are very pleased with the Murano.  I like it better than another family member's 2017 Lexus RX350.
The comfort level and how well it is equipped.
"Nissan seems to create vehicles that suit our lifestyle.  They are luxurious without being pretentious.  They are reasonably priced for what they offer.  More items are standard than on American cars.  My previous experience with Nissan has shown them to be reliable, also."
I have the vehicle for only 2 months no issues have shown up.
I have no one thing I like most.
I own from Datsun to Nissan.
The color of the interior
Because it is the best vehicle in the world
The car is not air tight. I can here air.
"I Love this SUV !  The inside is so pretty. It set up high , easy out and easy in. This was the best buy I ever made.    ,"
I love my new car!
"It looks great, drives great."
"It was rather expensive, but worth it to me."
Todo bien gracias
Por que estoy satisfecho en todo
reminds me of the Maxima I had but bigger
I think they get great gas mileage and are comfortable
Use instrument cluster and heating control clear covers that don't scratch by just looking at them.
Price
Price is good but residual value is horrible.
Comfort
It's nice
All features should work more consistently.
Comfort and fun to drive
Great purchasing experience. Car is beautiful and fun to drive.
"The CVT transmission is not the smooth ride it is advertised to be... In fact the operation of my prior vehicle, a 2003 maxima, was far superior."
Comfortable quiet ride. We'll designed interior.
Not happy overall with the transmission.
"more features,auto braking,heads up display,better sound system."
"ride ,roominess,looks,comfort."
warrenty should be longer as the compettition is...
"Front seats need more leg room. The dash is too curved and restricts leg room.I am 6'5"" tall the leg room is the only thing I don`t like."
looks
look of car and quality.
Explain:  1) Heater operation.    2) Transmission sound.  Adjust as needed.  Adjust:    1) Liftgate.
"Almost everything (this is our second Murano).  So far, its been a pleasure to drive both in the city and on the highway.  The comfort is exceptional.  The power is there when needed."
"My last two Nissans took me roughly 135,000 miles before either the body/frame gave us problems or the power train gave us problems."
"Overall quality to cost is outstanding, prior vehicle was an Infiniti which is an exception vehicle and a hard act to follow, I no longer wanted an 8 seater so looked at and test drove a Rogue (too small and not feeling it for me) so drove a Murano, best fit....Tom Hesser Nissan staff was outstanding to find me exactly all the necessary items I needed in the vehicle."
If I could fine out what that popping sound is. Everything else is great.
"Like everything about it, especially the safety features."
It's a great vehicle
reduce gas consumption
The design
Nissan is a very great car
I would like a better sound system.
Everything.
"Safety, look & performance is great,"
see comments about back up warning
comfortable for travel
"Storage nearly the same as Rogue, cabin is wider and engine more powerful, but for the price difference not sure we gained very much."
stations have static.
performance and style.
we like the vehicle
It's new so everything is great right now.
The alerts that are in place.  Blind spot alert
Very satisfied with my car
"Nothing, we love our Murano."
The looks and handling.
It is a great car.
Make it handle better.
Safety and tech features.
A very good car for the price.
Style.
Good car overall
Great car
The only issue that I had was the dealer not making the tire good less than 2000 miles on a tire for it to blow out at highway speed and be damaged to the point where I had to buy new one I found completely unacceptable the tire cost me almost $300 should be some kind of warranty for something like that
I had a Nissan before this one I've also had the Maxima and another Murano and I've been real happy with Nissan cars I just hate that this tire situation put a negative spin on this whole deal but hey it's a dealer.
I really like the Nissan Murano I just purchased I've had one before and I got great service out of it as well and my wife loves the car so I'm happy. But I'm just really disappointed that a tire having to be replaced on a blowout was not covered by some kind of warranty especially as expensive as those tires are that's all .
great
"nothing comes to mind - my comments could be due to my last car being a Mercedes - selected Nissan due to the GREAT service at Nissan of Venice, plus my past owning of 3 Nissans (Murano, Pathfinder & Maxima) since 1990."
"handling, turning radius, sharp futuristic looks"
past experience and GREAT service history at Nissan of Venice
"Overall I'm still very pleased with my Murano. Some of the issues I've had can be fixed when I take it in for my first service appointment. The others, like the navigation screen I can live with. I am still happy that I purchased this vehicle."
It is a very quiet and comfortable ride! The seats are the most comfortable of any vehicle I've owned. Love the steering and handling. Love the roominess.
"We looked at and test drove a variety of cars before purchasing our Murano, including some high end luxury SUV's. None of them were as comfortable or quiet as the Murano. I was able to get the Murano fully loaded for less than the base price of the others, and prefer how it drives and handles the road more. Aside from the navigation, no other cars were as good as the Murano."
Could make the vehicle have a little  more leg room.
"The technology features that come with the SV model. Navigation, Map, Nissan connect."
"The vehicle is ok for a small family of 3 that wants a mid-size SUV, but I feel like the vehicle needs a little more room in the front of the interior and another small compartment area."
I really love my car if I can just get this rattle fixed in it I don't have any other problems with it
The weight of the car I love the heavier frame feel in the width of the inside of the vehicle in the inside is really luxurious is really pretty with the Pearl and the leather I'm satisfied very satisfied except for the Rattle and we do plan to take it to Meridian and get it looked at
Like I said I'm really satisfied except for the rattle other than that I'd buy it again tomorrow and a heartbeat
"I really like the murano and I haven't had any concerns with the car,the gas mileage has taken me time to get us to we went from a 2013 VWPASSAT turbo diesel to this one and it's been a huge change But we like Nissan and are glad we purchased it.  Wish I had gotten a sun roof that would be a great standard package item."
The style of it ...it's a awesome looking an driving suv.
For the money it's a great deal.  And I bought it at Sisk in Hopkinsville Ky and I would definitely deal with them again!
Overall handling and options
Very satisfied with value
Comfort
Because it stands out against other vehicles of similar size
Very smooth drive with excellent performance
Experience a very reliable product
"Great car, my family loves it."
"Truly a driving experience,  sports car like."
"I really like the Murano. Its interior and exterior styling are outstanding. The sound system feels mediocre compared to other vehicles I've owned, considering it's the Platinum model. Also, there's no oil life/change indicator, and you can't add a destination in Nav once the vehicle is moving, which is an annoyance when you have a passenger at the controls."
"Very smooth ride, its aesthetics, and the safety features (blind spot indicators, brake assist)."
"Thinking about what you get with the Platinum model versus comparable features on luxury brands, I think it's a great value. But I haven't owned my vehicle long enough to rate it on overall reliability and value. Ask me at 3 years/100,000 miles. :)"
"We had a cracked windshield, we notified Fletchers. The windshield was replaced, the service was excellent. Our salesman Rocky has been wonderful. He was very knowledgeable about the features of the car and has always provided us with excellent service when we called. We had limited time to look for a vehicle, we told Rocky what we were looking for he had cars ready on our arrival for us to look at and did not waste our time looking at cars that did not meet the guidelines of what we wanted. Great job Rocky!!!"
The smoothness of the ride.
"Read the previous post. Overall excellent car, and exceptional service from our salesman."
All safety upgrades should be added to all vehicles.
The body style and the interior
"Because,  I had to do a dealer trade and during this transition some of my upgrades were taken away."
"Better quality assurance/controls to ensure that vehicles don't get to customers with issues that shouldn't even be issues.  Very disturbing that a brand new vehicle has to go into the repair shop for a week, within the first month of ownership."
the color and the smell
Simply due to the issues we've had since purchasing the vehicle.
Make sure door panels match.
room and comfort
I have not had enough experience with a Nissan as of yet.
"side pockets left of the driver's seat and the right of the pass. seat are too small. You should have stayed with the 2003 Murano with the pop out system for storing maps, etc. At least you put the clock on the dash and the center screen (my 2011 had the clock only on the speedometer screen)!!"
"Very nice ride, warning lights when another car is in your blind spot, gas mileage is higher than my 2011-very good, and CVT transmission. I cooped at Ford Motor when I was in college in auto transmissions. We tried to design this type of trans. but the materials were not there. The lockup torque converter came out of the group I cooped in!! When this trans. was offered in the 2003 I had to have one. Excellent unit to drive!!!"
Everything is excellent and has worked so far.
Miss the shallow storage that was on top of  the spare tire in the earlier model.
It's a pretty car
Issue w security system
Room inside
"When I have contacted Nissan regarding a problem, no assurance is offered in getting the problem resolved.  This has not happened but I have the distinct feeling that if I called regarding a windshield wiper problem that I would get a response that I could download this weather app and avoid the need to drive in the rain.  Regarding a navigation system problem that was experienced, I did receive a response that the 2-D mode is not working properly and I would have to use it, the nav system, in Bird's Eye view.  I refused to trash the 2-D mode and the problem, which was a setting, has been corrected.  Absolutely no assurance from the Nissan that the problem could or would be corrected."
The overall exterior appearance and the quietness.
"An overall feeling that I have no support from Nissan in getting a problem resolved, a you bought it, it's yours attitude."
Comfortable front seats!
"I like the brand, my husband and I have owned several and have been happy with all of them"
Overpaid for the financing due to lack of transparency by finance manager. The vehicle is not properly prepped prior to receipt  even to this day it has factory protection still not removed from doors and small piece. The backseats are incredibly uncomfortable.
It has a beautiful exterior design
"It's starting to get expensive especially on adding features, and the appeal to a man is decreasing each year as it seems to be more geared towards women"
Nothing I can think of this is a exceptional vehicle. I am extremely pleased with my purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat. Nissan hit this out of the park as far as I am concerned. I could have bought anything else but once I saw this I was sold. Thank you for such a great suv.
The interior and color combination.
The vehicle speaks for itself.the buying experience was great also.
"The trunk area needs more than one little light, you can barely see when it is dark outside."
I love the body style and how it rides.
"I last 8 vehicles I have owned is Nissan, when I go car shopping I head straight to Nissan dealership."
"The ""mud flap"" in front of the left rear wheel lost two(2) bolts that held the flap in place. I remove the flap around having 1,000 miles on the car..That is the only problem that I knowof."
I love every thing about the car. I could recommend the car to anyone.
It could have been offered in solid white and offered with top level features without having to get leather.
Comfort
I had an easy car buying process and I love my Nissan!
Even better fuel economy would be nice.
Comfort and appearance.
"I love the quality and appearance of the Nissan vehicles, and had a truly exceptional experience at the dealership."
Update the software so that I can have all of the Nissan Connect app and Apple Car Play. Or replace the system so that I can have all of the Nissan Connect apps and Apple Car Play
The room inside and the comfort driving it
The last two car I have purchased from Nissan didn't have working technology it advertised
Would like fog lights installed and that doesn't seem to be possible.
"The engine, the GPS, the handling, the suspension, the exterior appearance."
"There wasn't clear communication about the features my Murano would or wouldn't have when we switched down to an S model (I didn't know it didn't have fog lights or powered seats, for example, until I started driving it). I also feel that I was given an unfair trade-in price for my 8 month old Rogue (It was below the Kelley blue book standard for the excellent condition it was in). When I called in to try to discuss these issues, there was no resolution. I had to speak to 3 different people. Also, for whatever reason, there was a disconnect between the dealership and my financial institution and the pay-off wasn't communicated in time. I therefore received a huge hit on my credit report that I'm still trying to get fixed. I like Nissan cars, but this dealership in particular has been very difficult to work with."
The technology inclusive features are from one extreme to the other with the technology.  Other manufacturers are slight with what is included from the different levels but Nissan is extreme.  Only bought for overall look and my Husband likes Nissan.  The stock stereo is crap!  We are looking to replace!
Look  ride  Luxury feel  Quiet when windows shut
The difference of top tier to lower tier is extreme.  The upgrades are ridiculous!  Ford's difference was very minor from top to next level like rear view mirror and garage capability only..Nissan is all or nothing.  Larry Miller Nissan in AZ is a joke too!  Own vehicle for 3 months on May 4th and paid cash...no registration or title.  the process was joke...communication was bad and nobody knew what they were doing.  I kept getting paperwork to sign the first month. I owned the vehicle
very happy with it
"roominess, interior/exterior design, navigation/bluetooth capabilities"
I have owned 3 Nissan vehicles previously and have been very happy with all of them so it was a no-brainer to continue wiith a Nissan Vehicle.
1. Give the S trim an option from the factory or ship some with the Bose audio option.  Everything else is great.
"Everything, but the V6  and up hill acceleration from xtronic transmission is what I like! Doesn't stop until I take my foot off the gas pedal.. Whew!!!      Blessed be GOD and thank you NMAC!"
20 years of drivetrain excellence  and I answered 0 for the other question because I don't want to tell people about my secret night creeper
I love the car... just disappointed in the Navigation and phone connectivity.
"surround camera, intelligent cruise control, seat comfort, sun roof"
Technolgy integraton and nav system are an issue
Fix the issues noted.
"The amount of features - heated/cooled seats front and back, cameras, safety features, amount of room and overall style both inside and out"
There are some issues to be fixed- the Bluetooth issue has been an issue for previous models and is something other brands don't struggle with.
The overall look of the vehicle. The seats are very comfortable.
.
"There could have been more ""bells & whistles"" in the model. For instance having power seats or at the very least a power driver seat could have made a big difference."
I think I like the exterior of the vehicle the most.
Based on my prior financial relationship with NMAC and the customer service of the dealership that I purchased the vehicle from.
Already have recommended it.
The look
"This is the 4th Nissan in a row that I have owned and I have loved everyone of them. The look, quality of the drive etc..."
I love most things about my Nissan
ideas how to manage fuel consumption
The advertised gas mileage for City is way overstated on the vehicle sticker.  I sometimes only get about 13 miles per gallon in the City. It is also tough to get a good gauge since there is no Trip reset when refueling.
"The sun/moon roof, the Bose sound system, the drive on the vehicle, handling quietness etc."
"When I leased the Nissan Murano SV with Premium package I didn't receive all the features identified in the Nissan Murano brochure (for an SV with a Premium package), I feel it was an intentional deception by Nissan which was NEVER corrected. I didn't received the heated front seats etc, I only received the Panoramic roof and Bose sound system. It is clear that my complaint caused Nissan to update the brochure for the Murano, but I was never given any concession for the intentional deception."
Needs improvement in warning sounds.
Appearance and performance.
I love the car except the warning sounds.  Other vehicles we've had were much better.
i thought a vehicle of this standard would have lane monitoring and self stopping  like cheaper cars  disappointed with that
reliabity      but its new and my first nissan   time will tell ask me in 5 years things might be different
nice overall high ratings
This my 3rd Nissan    2nd Murano and my next car will another Murano
Better positioning of the fuel tank lever.  Seat cooling option.  Don't tie sunroof option in with tech options.
I really like the power and how smooth it drives.
I think its the best SUV for the money.  I tested or looked at just about everything in this price range.
it would be nice if the back seat folded Dow perfectly flat.
The technical goodies.
It is a good looking and good performing vehicle.
"There is not much, at this time, to improve how I feel about it now.  It's only 2 months old, Nissan hit a home-run (in my opinion!) with the Murano styling, handling & features.  The true test in my book is how it holds up & performs over time, reliability.  I am extremely happy at this point with my Nissan experience and the car.  At this time, we anticipate returning in a couple years for a vehicle for my husband."
"The ride, handling & features."
"This is my 2nd Nissan.  Overall I liked the Xterra, but unfortunate couple of sensor bugs created some expensive annoyances.  Nissan styling, features, handling are hard to beat."
"Interior noise level is good, but not what I had in a previous vehicle."
"appearance, drive"
"Reliable, dependable and the car is exactly what I was promised during the buying process."
"Wonderful car. It's very close to being a luxury vehicle. I know that Infiniti is Nissan's luxury division, and your mainstream cars can't cross into the luxury market, but I'm a luxury buyer and ended up with the Murano. That being said, I really think there should be options for:  Head's up display  Rain sensitive wipers  Active lane departure  These are all offered on other vehicles that seem to be in the Murano territory. My last two cars had them and I miss them."
Styling both inside and out.
"I have been truly surprised by the level of sophistication of the Murano. The more I drive it, the more I like it."
nice smooth ride and spacious
Better gas mileage.
"Roominess, sound system, power lumbar"
Because I LOVE my car!
"I absolutely love this car. The problems were bad, but not enough to make me not love it! Gas usage is sticker shock coming from an Elantra, but if you want a powerful car, you gotta pay the price and is sooo worth it to me"
"engine power! Smooth ride, luxurious interior, most comfortable car I have ever been in"
"everyone has been so wonderful, sales and service alike!"
the seats
some customers just want to buy made in American
"I am a very intuitive person, however, the nav system is hard to understand and operate."
see ratings of 10
Love the car!!! Very happy.
Everything.
"Great quality, value, well made. My3rd vehicle. Kept my last Nissan 13yrs and 216,000 miles with no issues!!!!  Interior holds up well. Love them."
For the entertainment package placing monitors in the headrest would be a plus. Also more hp at take off would also help
The panoramic roof
I like NisSan aND Infiniti vehicles
Enjoying my vehicle although bluetooth drop out sometime overall love it
The ride
Always have enjoyed Nissan vehicles
"some added tech features like lighting at doors when approaching, better seat cooling system, rear area stow compartments, better sun-visor, seats seem a bit narrow, improve 6 cylinder sound when accelerating to be more sporty sounding."
"style, size, look, drive-ability, displays"
"good value for the price, comfort, design, feel of safety.handling"
Nice car. Only had for 2500 miles. Need more time
style
The dealer post service is really bad. It's like after they sold the car they don't care about customer anymore
"The back-up camera does not show cars @ a far enough distance - very easy to hit a car when backing up because u can not see.    Sounds like we have open windows when riding down the road.   The blind spots should have a LOUDER beep w a brighter color.     The navigation system should  b closer to the driver - not n the middle of the car where it is not accessible for the driver w/o taking eyes off the road.   More, frequently used controls, for the car should b closer to the driver where they r easily accessible."
Safety Features - however some safety features need to b twiked for better safety.
My experience w my Mercedes was the ultimate.
I have always been disappointed with the paint.
Remote start
Nissan has the best overall quality and the people at Bob Richards Nissan are wonderful !!
Still trying to learn usage of all the controls....more later
HP gives quick response but unit still good on mileage
Haven't had enough time or mileage to form opinion about Murano or the new dealer...So far very good on both
Interior comfort
Extremely nice car
Improved fuel economy. At least as stated by Nissan of 28 mpg
The vehicle performs in all areas well above expect ions. Except mpg
I have owned the Nissan brand for over thirty years. A one time owning 5 Nissan vehicles at the same time. I feel this version is out standing in appearance and comfort and technology and performance
"I really enjoy this vehicle. The only one issue I have is that in South Florida with the hot sun it does take a little while to cool off the vehicle, This is more a south florida and vehicle size issue than a problem with the SUV"
Great drive and comfortable seats
Love the vehicle. Great technology and comfortable seats at a reasonable price.
"This is the best Murano yet.  I have now bought and leased 3 Muranos and love the sharp modern styling, color of red is the right red, thank you...It's very comfortable and since I deliver a lot of boxes, it is roomy for my loads.  I really have no complaints.  Everyone who sees my '17 Murano is very impressed.  Much better looking than any other car on the road.  It drives smoothly, the radio is crisp, it is easy to navigate the controls. I could go on and on.  Please give me a big discount on my next Murano in 2020.  Thank you and your staff for creating this dream car!"

Install capability to open the trunk from the inside and do something about the paper doll cut out that's on my gear shift
Looks
Already have
Are there any adjustments to the steering that can be done?
All is good the steering concerns me.
Still concerned about the steering on a vehicle that only has 2100 miles on it and is brand new. What will the steering be like as the car ages and gets more mileage on it that may effect its performance.
Better seat adjustment on passenger side.  Disappointed in fuel economy in driving arond town at 17.8 mpg. Wished you would have kept the hybrid for 2017.Highway mpg is great at over 28 mpg.
"Appearance,seats,and interior roominess."
Only negative is mpg around town.
Fuel Economy could be better still only getting 20 miles to a gallon in town.
Color and Style
"Well I only have 1,500 miles on the Murano and the window issue should be happening."
Its new the color drives great.
I asked sales person to make sure That I had car with pushbutton for the back door .but I did not get that never check until We got home
Performance and style is outstanding

I like the look and feel of the suv
CHIP RESISTANT PAINT
RELIABILITY
DEPENDABILITY
This is my second Nissan purchase. I loved my first one so much that when it was time to make a new purchase I knew that I wanted another Nissan. The gas mileage on the Murano is exceptional!
The quality of the Nissan product cannot be compared to other vehicles.
I LOVE MY NEW VEHIICLE. ITS AN OLD PERSONS SPORTS VEHICLE!
VERY IMPRESSED WITH GAS MILEAGE.
HAVE NO COMPLAINTS WITH VEHICLE THUS FAR. WOULD RECOMMEND  TO ANYONE.
"Interior design and quality,comfort,smooth ride, and engine responsiveness."
Great value and overall dependability
don't understand how to update the eco-report for fuel mileage when it says Update
how it handles and the blind spot alerts
This my third Murano and I like how they drive and how safe the vehicle is
"For a Bose speaker system, the sound is pretty average. The sound seems to be all concentrated toward floor in the front without great ""surround"". I had to adjust the fade towards the back to make it feel more balanced."
"Exterior appearance is very stylish, driver and passenger seats are very comfortable."
"I've only owned my Nissan for about 2 months. So far, everything has been great but I haven't had much interaction with the service department yet and that interaction greatly affects my willingness to repurchase the same brand or recommend."
"We have had no issues. It is a very responsive and comfortable vehicle. For what ever reason,  we thought the vehicle had the lane assist feature,  but it appears that it does not."
Comfortable
"We have 2 nissians, but other people's vehicle needs are different."
no
"Good quality, nice looking, runs good"
"Generally we are greatly impressed, I worked as a Datsun service manager for my purchasing dealer back in in about 1979. Overall product is heads and shoulders above the old vehicles. Great appearance and overall quality. I will need to take my Murano in for these minor problems when we have the time. We are both recovering from minor surgeries."
"Overall appearance and quality and driving dynamics. However I also worked for Maremont Corp. for 7 years so (automotive exhaust systems and brakes) so I'am sensitive to exhaust tuning, my Murana has a some what iretating exhaust ""period"" at 1000 RPM, no one else whom has ridden or driven it has noticed it so I conclude it is not really a probem. As a passenger I can also tell when it it being driven at 1000RPM."
So far great vehicle
"The only thing I dislike about the car is the sun visors. I wish they were a little longer to help block out more sun.  Other than that, everything is fine!"
Love the car.
Offer  the Maxima engine as an option in the Murano.
Style and quality
Good style and good build quality. Should last a number of years with proper service.
"I noted that interior storage is a minor issue. Previously I had a 2005 Murano, and it had a nice little area underneath the radio to store small items. The new console/radio area in the 2017 model eliminated that space, and I miss it tremendously."
"I absolutely love everything else about the interior. It is simple, classy, and doesn't go overboard with design features like wood grain or multiple materials. The seats are incredibly comfortable, I love the instrument cluster, the radio is fabulous, tech features are great, and I like the panoramic moonroof more than I thought I would."
"I previously owned a Honda and a Toyota before moving to Nissan 12 years ago. Nissan makes more of a driver's car, and I appreciate that. My only tough decision this time around was debating between a Maxima for maximum sportiness or a Murano since I have a family of five."
Never had a bad experience.
We are very happy with everything.  We had Nissan in the past and were happy with other cars.
I am bummed by the fact that it is not still a quiet ride....  It normally is 2 or 3 years old and then a car loses its tightness...
Passenger front seat person can not roll down window or start car while waiting
Interior leather and dash
Our age has trouble using the wipers and all technology
Love our Murano.
Appearance & comfort.
We've owned several Nissans & have been happy with all of them!
All
Love it
The compass!
"Looks, quality, ride, and handling!!!"
The exterior and interior styling makes me feel like I'm in a luxury vehicle for the non-luxury price.
I don't feel I've had the car long enough to give a higher recommendation.
I wish the fuel door release was not next to the hood release. Electric button was better. Also front camera button would be better on left side of screen.
Intelligent cruise control and 360 camera. Great
It just fits well. Reliable
Fuel economy needs to be improved. Seat adjustments for two needs to be looked at asap. Once I turn the Car off there is movement
It does ride nicely and easy to handle.
My last car was a Lexus. My expectations for car performance is High. I had one major problem with my new Nissan which I did take it to the Dealer two weeks ago. During heavy rain the front dash board lights went off and on. It made driving a little difficult.
Spacious
Nice vehicle
Interior color and design. Overall appearance of car
The sleek look and room for my child.
"Great customer service, great vehicle options"
I just think it a very good car.
Fuel economy
Mostly everything
"Of all the vehicles I have owned I found the Nissan model I have owned to be very reliable, great handling and very responsive vehicles.  I have always their their interior and exterior design to be very pleasing."
"Nissan needs to consider offering more options for interior colors. I chose the light tan color (cloth) because I truly hate black interiors and exteriors. Black is the only other option on the Murano. PLEASE consider offering a light to medium gray, and not solid color but cloth with other hues mixed in. That color scheme does not show dirt as badly as very light or very dark colors. I don't buy cars very often, so I am stuck with the light color interior of my Murano for years. I am getting used to it, but it is quite hard to keep clean with grandkids climbing in and out, etc."
"It handles very well and is easy to drive. I like the advanced electronics, especially the tire pressure readings, mpg indication, and navigation system. Although I will probably not have the navigation system updated. I already own two portable navigation units that are updated FREE every month, so I will not be paying the $100-$200 robbery fee dealers charge to update built-in navigation. All auto companies should be ashamed of that ridiculous fee."
"I haven't owned my Murano long enough to have any indication of reliability, so really cant give a 10 recommendation until I have owned it for a few years."
Make seats that can be adjusted higher for short people.
Technology in the car such as the all view camera.
"It's well engineered, a quality product and reliable."
It's beautiful inside and out. I do notice my LED blinkers on my mirrors don't always work. I don't know if that's an issue with the vehicle or if they only work certain times and I haven't figure that out yet. Overall it's my most favorite vehicle I've ever owned.
My husband and other family members have had a Nissan and they are very reliable.
Love this car.  Best we have ever owned.
Performance and looks.
Great vehicle.
Improve rear view mirror visibility.
Technology features. How it handles on the highway. Quietness of the inside and quality of sound from Sirius radio.
Professionalism of sales staff and customer service personnel. Interior and exterior design of car.
Handling while going on right hand curv s is a little stiff.
The body style and color.
Very reliable cars.
Nothing at this time.  I love it.
The roominess and the smooth drive.
"Because i have not hd any trouble at all with my vehicle, with service of it or anything."
"Provided a vehicle with low mileage, not demo car"
Nothing at this time
Disappointed this time
"Add rear pull out drawer to center console, like prior model. Add rear fan/temp control to center console .  Increase fuel tank capacity.  Prior model had larger volume tank... now refueling more often.... slight increase in the fuel economy did not offset the diminished driving range in real world driving."
"Style,  interior qualty,  pana.sunroof.    We had test driven the Lexus rx350 so called luxury SUV,  but this new model Murano outshines the RX350 by wide margin in many aspects."
"Fuel tank volume less than prior model, diminishes drive range, causing to refuel more often"
I love my car!! I have no complaints.
"Very roomy! Back up camera is great! Overall, great safety features."
I've been driving Nissan vehicles for 20 years and have never had any major problems
Don't care for the mixture of formed plastic on the steering wheel. Where the surfaces connect the molded plastic is not smooth fitting and rough on the hands.
Like the product
"I would really like to be able to use my handsfree device anytime I'm in my car since it's illegal to talk on phone while driving. Also, if it would warn me when I'm about to back into anything. Replacing tail lights is an expensive way to find out there is no backup warning."
I love my vehicle and am very proud of it I plan on having it a long time. The complaints I mentioned are the only things I don't like
I've only had it a few months and have had these issues would like to own it longer to make sure no other issues arise before I tell someone to get one. Plus I haven't dealt with maintainance yet to find out how expensive or the convenience factor yet and both are important to me to know before I give a 10
"Appearance, economical operation, dealership quality"
"We love our new car.  Wish it hd a heated steering wheel, but we can live with this one."
"We have driven a Nissan for several years and love the way they handle and the service we get.  Whave had Maximas, Rogues and Pathfinders and we loved them all."
Nothing! I love it!  I will continue to buy Nissan!  Good job!
Exra features offered on my Platinum edition Murano
"Everything ... exterior, interior, cargo space  Dependability... on each of the 3 Nissan models I have owned previously."
.
Pay off my loan
Everything
I really like the car

Better gas mileage would be a plus. Passenger seat needs a lumbar support.
We like the looks of the vehicle and the comfortable ride.
So far this seems like an excellent vehicle.
"comfort, quiet interior"
don't often recommend products to friends
"Not anything against Nissan because all other manufacturers are doing it but, cars now all seem to come with Apple car play. Not all people buy Apple products so, at least for me, it's not a ""must have""."
"The style, outside appearance."
I've had Nissan as well as others and consider Nissan to be one of the best we've had.
"Wish it was AWD... Had a 2015 AWD, it handled better, got better gas mileage. The audio system was better than what I have. Plus the rear hatch was powered . The hatch is heavy for me and really liked the ability to push a button to close it. Liked the ground lighting on my 2015 and was just overall pleased with it more than my 2017."
The body style and comfort.
I like the Nissan product just wish my current Murano had the features my prior one had.
Technology
Outstanding quality. Very comfortable on long trips.
Nothing!  We absolutely love it!!
The interior comfort.
"Reliability, value, how easy the buying process was from Melloy"
I love my Murano it would be nice if it was a little quieter but it's not that bad
I just love the overall appearance and drivability of it
Handling quietness and good pickup
Ease and friendliness of purchasing
"I believe I have purchased a lemon! Before the time has come for my first oil change, the transfer case and transmission have been replaced twice. The car is currently in the shop now. I have opened a case with Nissan, hoping for a buy back. I believe that the Murano is a good car, just not the one I got. The dealer so far has not been able to fix the transmission leak which causes a burning smell. If the car is not fixed after I pick it up tomorrow, I'm hoping that Nissan will do the right thing and buy it back. I never really got to enjoy the new car experience."
I like the exterior look and the sound system.
I haven't had a good experience with my new car yet.
"Sometimes there is difficulty getting my iPhone 7 to connect, only an intermittent issue. Voice recognition needs work.   I did a quick off the line start the other day for the first time and the front end was a little squirrelly.  Normally the ride is very smooth and good pick up and go.   Overall I a very happy with all aspects of the Murano.  Looks nice and is super comfortable to drive."
"Nice smooth ride, many control options, and good technological interface."
"Great vehicle, comfortable, reliable, and versatile."
more air vents in the back
I feel comfortable and safe and it is very stylish
my neighbor bought one because of me
"Improve turning capacity, improve the ease of turning the steering wheel."
Body style and interior design is very appealing.
Diffently like the body style.
.
.
.
Better fuel efficiency.
"Intelligent cruise control, blind spot monitoring, all around camera"
"Smooth driving experience, smart look, moon roof"
Have a place where a small portable waste paper basket could be attached.
The new technology that makes almost everything easier.
I think it's a good buy for the money.
"Improve the quality of your connectivity. Add more apps, such as Pandora. Add Apple Car Play..... to MY vehicle."
"Comfort, appearance, safety and utility."
"Excellent, but not perfect vehicles."
The passenger seat should have the same controls that the driver's seat has.
I like the looks of the interior and exterior.  My favorite feature is the location of the blind spot reminder.  I find that very helpful in traffic.
The car is roomy without looking bulky and does not drive like a truck as many SUV's do.
nothing
At this moment I'm good with overall performance and comfort of my Murano. If I had one recommendation it would be to maybe improve the ease of opening the door if I have a keyless entry I have to press the button on the door - previous keyless vehicles I've driven didn't require that making it easy to get in. Sometimes I have to press several times before the door opens.
Overall I'm happy with the vehicle and I've suggested family members look at it as an option when purchasing a new vehicle
Daaaaa
Because the whole sales process was so unprofesional and ensuing problems left a bad taste in my mouth
"Safety features, Attraciveness, Style ,Gas mileage"
Great  Satisfaction wit vehicle
Upper part of hood is slanted downward toward windshield.  At certain sun angles the reflection off this part of the hood creates a blinding reflection into the drivers eyes that can be extremely uncomfortable and dangerous
"Solid, appearance, quiet, interior, cameras"
I have owned approximately 8 Muranos.  Have never been disappointed
maybe get a little better mileage.  But really absolutely no issues with my Murano.    l love it
More storage.   There is only a glove box and a very small side trunk compartment in this vehicle.   The road noise is very loud needs better insulting.   Paid for the SL model but feel like I got a S in return.
"Very attractive, sleek looking car.  Fuel efficiency it a lot better on this model than my Subaru Tribeca ever was."
"They fuel cost and road noise of this particular model is not something I would recommend to a friend.  Nissan as a whole, I would recommend."
"Having owned 7 Maxims prior to the Murano, I was a little nervous about changing vehicle types! But I am truly pleased! Love my Murano??"
I like sitting up higher and enjoy the spaciousness! Its fun to drive??
"Reliability and Quality, not to mention awesome service!"
"Nothing -- I have rated all areas very, very good or exceptiona;."
"The handling, comfort, cargo capacity, technology, styling -- you name it I like it."
This is my third Murano and I have not been disappointed yet.
Better gas mileage would be nice. Less interior noise. Smoother ride.
The way it looks
Because there are too many surveys!
I love the radar speed adjustment with the cruise control.
Wonderful dealer service. Great vehicle quality and innovation. Those seats!
improve the ability for a short person to see out -  bad blind spots in the back
comfortable ride
it's ok
We are very happy in all respects with our new Murano. It does all we expected very nicely. We are glad we purchased it!
The ride is superb. Great translation from the road to the driver. Comfort is excellent and the electronics are the easiest to use.
"Ease of purchase from Monroe Nissan. Our salesperson, Rob Plummer was extremely knowledgeable about the Nissan products and the entire sales staff very easy to negotiate with."
"It's beautiful , comfortable , and it rides smooth !"
I love my Nissan and I love the dealership ( Don Williamson ) and my Saleswoman !
I am a little disappointed in the quality of some items in the interior my Murano I feel that the carpet is very thin and cheap I feel that the leather on the seat is not that high of a quality I also feel that the framing the front and sides on the seat that are plastic has too much of a gap between the seat and that piece it just the tracks and cheapens the look of the interior of the vehicle and again as I said the carpet is very cheap looking it looks like felt not carpet
"I do like the ride on the Murano the back window is a little small, hard to see out of I love the look of the exterior the paint is very nice overall I do really like my Murano but I am disappointed with the quality of the interior"
Well I would recommend Nissan to a friend I've never had a vehicle with a transmission like the Murano so therefore I have to wait to find out how it's going to do this is a new vehicle that I have never driven this is my first Nissan vehicle I've always driven a Honda and the quality of the Honda in my opinion does is a step higher above Nissan
The vehicle could be a bit more roomy without adding a third row seat.  The noise level isn't what I would expect from a vehicle in this price range.  I would expect it to be much quieter while all windows and the sunroof are closed.  Highway noise drowns out the sound system when a window is opened.
"I like the cameras, the blind side detectors and the smooth ride.  I also enjoy the quick acceleration of the vehicle.  I love the wheels although after driving it home the first time I detected nicks.  I like the look of them but the construction could be better.  There are many things that I like about this car."
I would recommend Nissan to my friends.  9 is not a bad score so I'm not sure why this is a question now.
Trunk space is smaller than in my 2013 Murano.
The interior.
"I really like it, but it would be nice if the trunk were larger and opened wider. I have hit my head several times when reaching in not remembering how low the trunk door is when opened. A parking valet hit his head on it yesterday too."
"Handling, transmission, and gas mileage."
"Extremely smooth transmission, great engine pickup, gas mileage."
The front seat up and down system
Great ride great looking car
Gray car
the seatbelts are a little too far back on driver's side
easy driving   navigation   locking of doors
I have bought three Muranos
"The car trembles when idling.  Not sure if its needs better quality of fuel.  Also, speakers throughout the car for greater sound quality would have been ideal."
I like how beautiful it looks.
"This is my first Nissan.  Everything from the research, buying experience and ownership experience has been great."
Overall very good crossover
Interior room
"Overall quality, style, power and comfortable"
This bluetooth problem needs to be fixed.  It is becoming a safety concern.
The innovative safety features.
"I am being run in circles with this Bluetooth problem.  If it was set up the way Nissan set up the 2011 Murano, this would not be an issue."
Gauges on dash are a bit difficult to see.
It is a good car!
Nice looking car with a good ride.
I am very pleased with my choice and purchase of my new Murano. I absolutely love it.
Everything
I am very pleased with my purchase and the dealership that I bought it from. They are outstanding.
"The vehicle itself is great, I am just not completely satisfied with the color. The original color I wanted wasn't available. Other than that the vehicle is great."
"I like the back exterior of the vehicle, it is really sporty but still an SUV."
Nissans are great and the Germain Nissan Dealership that is near me is top notch. It is my Nissan dealer of choice in central ohio.
The low sound quality is very low.  Disappointing low.  I am considering replacing the speakers.    The major problem I find is in wet conditions the car behaves erratically.  going from dry to wet is nervous.  The traction control also activates under unnecessary (gravel from a stop) conditions and really keeps power from the wheels.
"The appearance, the gas mileage, the roominess."
The lease payment to value is great.
Because I love the car
"Steering need to move easier or to have different set up modes for it !   Very poor Condition upon delivery !!!  Fit and finish is where needs to improve !!!  We like this vehicle but almost walk away from it and buy something else,because of fit and finish !"
1-Safety  2-Looks
"Fit and finish hold me for higher recommendation !  Sound system is OK,but it sound as full range drivers  was used true out the system   instead of dedicated drivers for hi and low frequency ,it sound like there are no tweeters inside the car !"
"Steering seems a little to soft for a SUV, would prefer more of a solid feel when turning..  too loose"
"Interior and exterior design are great...  interior seating space, in particular the back seat versus other SUV's this size"
The features and quality for the price make it an exceptional value when i compared to similar SUV's
"My previous vehicle had a 700-plus mile range, this thing doesn't come close. I'd like a bigger tank and/or better mileage. However, I do like the performance.    The person who designed the oil dipstick should be slapped alongside the head. There should be a short tube, maybe 5"" long, and the stick itself shouldn't be unidirectional. You shoudn't have to use a flashlight when checking the oil."
"I like the CVT, it was one of the major factors in my purchasing decision. Hope it doesn't cause trouble and/or die prematurely. A decent auto tranny generally lasts at least 200,000 miles today, I expect no less from this car."
"I think Nissan has overall good designs and builds. I've had 2 Leafs besides the Murano and am looking forward to a Leaf 2 (or whatever you decide to call it). If you're concerned that I didn't rate it ""10"", well, nothing is perfect and other makes/models might be better suited for particular individuals."
It drives very nice
"It's a nice car, but it's too soon to tell how it will perform in the next year or so."
"This is my 5th Murano so I am very familiar with CVT.  I have experienced that at 1000 RPM the transmission is noisy and there is a vibration...the noise and vibration cease as soon as the transmission is below or above 1000 RPM.  This is the first Murano where I have even been aware of the transmission.  I mentioned it to the dealer and the response was ""but tell me how much you love the car."""
"External style, safety features, advanced electronics.  I was told the car was a 2017.5 with Apple Car Play which after 3 weeks of trying to hook up Apple Car Play I learned that the car was a 2017 and did not have Apple Car Play.  I don't know if having what I was promised would make me 100% enthusiastic about the car, but I am disappointed.  I did talk to the dealer about this and I was informed that I was confused."
"I feel like the Murano experience is not what it used to be...I have never had a concern about a Murano before but this one if making me question if I made the right decision.....between defective wiper blades, a noisy transmission and a dealer who only cares about making a sale I'm wondering what the next 3 years will bring."
The look and color
Like it. No issues yet.
Modern design and look.
Quality product.
usually don't make recommendations because everyone has diff. needs when buying a new vehicle
"Need more options for storage in front driving position. No convenient place to put cell phone, etc."
Appearance and drivability.
"This is my 4th Nissan,  extraordinary quality and value."
I want to be sure that the area of rough paint doesn't peel or rust.
The beautiful interior. Cooled seats!
Ouality for price.
I'm totally satisfied with my Morano only had about 3 months so far so good!
Love the ride very smooth! The seats are awesome...
I'm totally happy with mine that's why.
Such a good looking car that I expect a superior product. Car could be quieter. (Seal)  Noticed the rear of the car does not wash well in automatic carwash. Spoiler stays dirty.
Looks.
I generally don't make recommendations for high dollar items.
"The car should be quieter and I expected a better/softer ride.  There is quite a bit of wind and road noise.  Also, the Bose stereo is poor quality.  I would like to have seen adjustable pedals (our old 2007 Murano had this feature)."
"The interior design is excellent.  I love the look and feel of the materials.  The wood is obviously fake, so a more realistic looking wood would look better, but the colors are great.  The driver's seat is exceptionally comfortable--significantly more so than the 2017 Cadillac Escalade we had.  The interior lighting at night is also impressive and a great, upscale feature.  Would like to see auto wipers as well."
"It seems to be a great car with lots of features, good reliability, excellent interior design, and the most comfortable seats of any car I've been in."
I like everything about my Murano.
This is my Third Murano purchase. I love the Murano.  Best vehicle I have owned so far.
The traction control likes to take over when it should not and it has almost caused enough delay that I was close to being hit.
Roominess and handling
The dealership's in el paso aren't my favorite
"I wish there had been more options for interior color. Since the exterior color was Gun Metallic which I love, my only option inside was charcoal (black) or tan.  I chose the charcoal which I really don't like, too hot in the summer and it shows all the dust/dirt.  I told the dealership this at the time.  Wished I could have had a light gray interior.  I bought expensive seat covers for both front and back to break up the black.  Cost me an extra $420.  In couple of weeks it is going for its first trip to Colorado.  I like the way the car drives and handles."
I said it all in last text box.
I haven't really had it long enough to be able to judge it.  It has less than 500 miles on it and those have been little jaunts around town. I want to see how it does this winter with snow and ice.
"Air vents on each side in front need to be black in color because the silver, though it matches the rest of the decorative items on the dash, causes a distinct reflection on the windows exactly in front of the viewing area of the outside side mirrors causing a great distraction and could be a safety issue.  Also, needs more front console storage.    Also, in this day in age of electronic transmission shifting, WHY are you still taking up large amounts of console space with an out of date, large shifter?  I owned a 1964 Chevy Corvair in the 60's that had the transmission shifter on the dash.  Since the transmission shifting is now electronic, why should it take up a third of the console space?  We almost bought a Ford instead of the Murano for this exact reason."
Solid feel
Good value & comfort
"When we first wanted to buy a car we wanted one with rear entertainment system. When we found out the the Murano didn't have it we asked the sales person if it could be added into it and he said yes. When he tried to put the order for the system he found out that it was not made for the 2017 model yet. To us that was very disappointing, so it would be nice to make the rear entertainment system for the 2017 model."
All of it
Good service
Quality
"I have been a Nissan owner since 1989, have owned various models only exception is the model LEAF. Have always selected Nissan due to the quality and reliability of the vehicles. My adult children and grandchildren have a Nissan too"
I would probably need to be able to afford to upgrade to a model with different interior.
The body style.
I'm primarily basing the score on the look of the vehicle. Don't know a lot about the Nissan brand but I've heard good things from friends who drive them.
"CVT, Power, smooth ride. We had purchased a 2007 new, and the 2017 is far and above the quality of the 2007."
Great cars.
"Sunroof, heated seats, how quiet it rides (especially when using the phone via bluetooth)"
Yes somehow if you can update the software from 2017 to 2017.5 a little more easier people don't mind  to pay you for the extra cost.
Look good Save gas very smooth driving experience
I still feel like you're missing something
fix my problems
over all i like the car
"The only problem that I find annoying is,the dashboard on either side is reflecting into the side mirror. Therefore, as you drive during the day, you have to be careful to watch what comes from behind or along side of the car. If the dashboard had a darker finish on either side that would eliminate the issue. I was thinking of painting a dark color."
The reliability and comfort
I had a Nissan Murano before this one and gave it to my daughter. As with this one it feels right and I never had any issues with either of them. I absolutely Love my Car
"I only had it 3 months so we will see. Had a brand new 2015 Nissan rogue nothing but problems traded it with 15,000 miles so lets see with this. Tbis will determine if I stay a Nissan customer!"
Stylish and dependable m stay away from ROGUE!
Coming from a previous Rouge upgrading to the Murano the features are quite similar I was expecting more upgrades. The layout of the Rouge and Murano are too similar. The Murano should have a completely different interior from the Rouge.
"Very smooth ride, great handling."
They can get a Rouge and not spend as much money.
"The sales experience is still not what it should be, but the car is great."
Looks cool.
This is the 6th Nissan weve leased. We like them.
"It only has 600 miles,  so far, so good"
"Looks, ride, room"
I like it
No improvement needed
Everything
This is my second Murano and I have been very pleased with it.
"This the first Nissan, so far I like it."
It early to say right now. Only been three month.
"So far I like the vehicle, but like I say it to early."
The Bluetooth doesn't always connect to my phone. The heater takes longer to work than our Mazda.
"It's beautiful, drives smoothly, great safety features, very comfortable."
The dealership was wonderful to work with.  Our car is just what we hoped/expected from the ratings and reviews we studied.
It should get better gas mileage or have better power.  neither is good.
Exterior looks
I usually don't recommend things to others unless they ask for my opinion.
"Storage in  front doors needs to be deeper.  Glove box is hard to access items (very spacious, however)"
"Color, ride, roominess inside, brightness of interior"
We like the vehicle very much.
"To add something to check how close to the next oil change, also to be able to open the windows after the car is shut off. A lot of times you are sitting in the car either waiting for someone and u can't open the windows unless you start the car."
The style and comfort.
Because with any vehicle whether a nissan or other make their is some little things that could be improved
N/a
Sleek appearance and engine
Very friendly and fast service
Excellent car love my Murano.
I can't think of anything.  I love this vehicle and it is a great improvement over the prior design
"The styling, near luxury features at the price point.  Seats are supportive and comfortable."
This Murano is my 3rd leased Nissan and I have had no problems or issues with any of my NIssans
I'd like to figure out why the cell phone connection goes out and can't be reconnected until the next time you drive the car.
"This is my first SUV and I like sitting up higher.   It is also easier to park, and the exterior cameras and backup system are excellent."
I have been driving Nissan cars for close to 30 years and I have loved every one.
Remote entry for the trunk
The comfortable ride
I meant to push 9
The seats are incredibly comfortable.  The vehicle accelerates easily and is quite maneuverable.
The vehicle has exceeded my expectations.
Drives great!
It's good
Nothing to improve !
"The color , style of the car is classey. The the interior is exceptional ."
"Nissan is the best built cars and SUVs made , this is my 3rd one I have had ."
Nice luxury for the price point
"It's a good car, but it's pretty much the same as other cars in its class."
Good buying experience
Nothing
Good looks and tight rude.
I love all Nissans that I have owned
The window tint on the right front window has stretches. Unfortunately this did not occur until I rolled the window down.
Navigation and maps! It is a very smooth ride!
everything
Because meets all expectations
Rear hatch is difficult to open sometimes. Would be more useful to have an automatic tail gate open and close button.
The color blue and the cream interior
we bought the model without all the technology. I miss it as my old card had it all. The dealership told me it really wasn't necessary but they did not have the next model in the color I wanted.
Feeling of safety and security.
"This is a car that I have no reservations about recommending. It has great handling; latest technology for safety and convenience; ample room and comfort; and, stunning appearance."
I do love my Murano but it could offer more storage under the cargo area and 1 or 2 more small storage places easily accessed by the driver. Also the towing capacity stinks! My previous SUV could tow 3500 lbs & this one only tows 1500! I have not rated it 9-10 on everything due to the short time (3 months) I have owned it & the fact that I only have 1400 miles on it. I love the mocha interior color with the black exterior color! I easily get 22 mpg in town & 32+ mpg hwy (only have driven 70 mile trip with 4-5 slow down areas) mileage.
"Oh, sorry-I just answered this question with the previous one!"
Because overall I Love It!
The seatbelt pushes into my right hip which is very unconfortable.   I feel there should be more storage on the dash to place electronic items. Small  compartment areas maybe on the dash like my last armada had.  When I go in for my first oil change I will have them look at the windshield wiper
The exterior look is more sporty than previous models. I does drive very well.  I do feel more of the road I guess being closer to the road. Not a smooth ride  as I had hoped
Because they are good vehicles
"It has great features, is very stylish and comfortable."
Great cars.
Nothing.  I love it and when my lease is up I'll trade it for a newer one.  It is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned.
Power
It's overall appearance and performance
Text compatibility with Apple phones
The exterior look of the vehicle. Sporty but luxurious.
My daughter has a 2011 Nissan Murano. Has had no problems at all with it.  Requiring routine maintenance only. Still in surberb condition. That's what made me want one. I love this vehicle. I would highly recommend it to friends.
they are very dependable and high quality.
"I'm 6' 4"" tall and would like a bit more knee room like my 2004 Murano had. Would like tail gate to elevate by an additional 2-3 inches"
"Performance, handling. Currently on long distance trip and mileage looks to be better than expected so far"
survey should speak for itself to this question
"Luxury feel and good looks, along with good gas mileage."
Solid brand making quality vehicles
More visabilty looking out the back windows.  I do appreciate having the camera in the rear but there is a lack of visability with the high headrests and the small or angled back window.
The ride is great and is pretty easy to drive.
It's a great car.  Most of my cars except for one Jeep have all been NISSANs.
Seems like a nice car. Really it's too early to tell.
Better gas mileage would be a plus but wouldn't keep me from purchasing another Murano.
"It's roominess, overall look"
"This is my second Nissan. My first saved my life. With safety AND beauty, it's a no brainier."
I am still new to Nissan and need some more experience to go through how it feels
The leather has/seems to have an even softer feel than my last Murano.
We've always had good service and friendly sales and service people.
"Definite lack of accessible storage space for sunglasses and just stuff for the driver.  There are some places for stuff ie . the glovebox but it is just not easy to get at. Center counsel is the same way. Glove compartment is so dark nothing can be found and the center counsel is the same way. Great vechicle otherwise, but not the front compartment space use issue."
"General seating space in the vehicle and storage in the back.  power, ride, handling, navigation, appearance, electronics."
many positive aspects of the vehicle
Get a little better fuel mileage.
It is brand new.
"Some people may not want to buy a Nissan, it is not my place to force my beliefs on someone else, plus I am not getting paid to do your advertising.  Give me some kick backs and we can talk."
Everything is just great
The performance
Love the look and performance....This is a real head turner
Front passenger seat should be 8 way adjustable not 4. A better way to secure packages in the rear of Murano than a cargo net. Cargo nets are useless.
"Looks, comfort, roominess, adaptive cruise control, ease of driveability"
I have only owned this vehicle for three months. While I did own a 1985 Nissan that particular model is no Longer made.
great vehicle
A little better gas mileage.
Love how strong and powerful it feels. Also love the navigation screen.
I love the Murano more than other vehicles I've had.
Solid handling
Dependable vehicle and staff
Dealerships are awful
Very satisfied
Overall comfort
Reliable with stylish features at affordable price
Nothing other than the problem with a reflection in the rear view mirrors.
Rides smooth and quiet and look good.
Because we were not informed about how the tax and licensing takes place in the state of Oklahoma.  It was assumed we knew.  We have only lived in OK for a couple years and never bought a vehicle here.  We were not told that we had to take paperwork into the Tag office to get the tags and that taxes were owed at that time.
Smoothness of the ride.
Great quality.
Tell me how to update the voice Navigation to recognize my wife's voice and to get up to date maps
The comfort of the ride. The camera function when backing up and when pulling into my garage. It helps get the vehicle in the garage straight. It also helps parking in a tight parking spot of any parking lot.
This is my second Nissan Murano purchase for my wife. We love the ride and dependability we experienced with our last one.
n/a
Everything is great!
Roominess and fuel economy
Great service by Nissan employees
Correct the issue with the passenger seat belt.
I love the technology
The service I receive is always top notch.
"Great size, comfortable, easy to drive, beautiful interior."
The sales teams need to know the products especially on the phone connectivity at point of sale.
"The adaptive cruise control and Lane keeping systems, but this is not fair and the looks handling and the Air Conditioned seats are awesome."
The over all quality and reliability of Nissan Is legendary you know what you get.
Nothing
We have 3.  Love the cars
I rarely listen to radio but I'm sure it is a 10..  The only things I can think that needs improvement cup holders two small especially on the doors.  This maybe its me back window should be bigger looking through the mirror I don't get a full range view...   I just did a long trip and it was a dream to handle and quiet and great gas mileage.
did this on prev. page
It is  nice to drive quiet looks good mileage great those that have ridden it liked it.
"I just drove my Murano to Las Vegas and back.  The vehicle handled the trip exceptionally well and we were all happy with its performance. However for a Platinum package, it should have been equipped with hands free parking assist system."
Excellent overall performance
"Not a thing, perfect vehicle."
Comfort
"Great car, looks good, runs good and is comfortable."
Better viewing out back window.  The solid area between the front windshield and side window is too wide and makes viewing difficult in that area.
I love the exterior look of the car and the camera feature that lets you see if you are parked accurately between the white lines. Also the brakes have a great feel. And there is plenty of headroom in the backseat for passengers.
"I'm very happy with it, no major complaints and it gives a very comfortable ride."
This is our fourth Murano
"Audio beeps when you are approaching or about to make contact with objects really does not work well.  We expected it to work like other vehicles but apparently it might make one beep for a warning, other times it does nothing. Either way, very useless and disappointing.  We have a small garage and was something we thought was a good option."
"Roomy interior, sharp looking exterior, comfortable seating front and rear."
"Reliability, comfortable, style"
"wish it came with a power rear hatch, can this be installed on this vehicle?"
comfortable to drive
"this is my fifth Nissan, need I say more?"
Need more power outlet in front seat in a better location.
I haven't had it long enough to give it higher or lower score
I think the style comfort and what the vehicle is equipped with makes it a great buy.
"Exterior of car is made cheap, My Murano that I traded in for this vehicle was a sound car QUALITY Gasoline on my old Murano that I traded in was excellent on gas, the new Murano so far in my opinion is a guzzler"
Almost everything
"Murano I traded in was more spacious n the interior then the exterior which was much more important to me.  The exterior of my new Murano is beautiful and sharp but you have unuseful compartments within the vehicle  Go back to the interior of the 2006 Murano I had space wise and keep the exterior of this Murano and BAM what a dynamic vehicle you will Have   Also you have such limited choice of colors for the Murano, not good.  Every one is driving around in a Grey Metallic Car"
This is my first cross-over/SUV and I love it!  I have driven the Altima for 10 years (absolutely loved it!) but truly am happy with upgrade to the Murano!
The exterior/interior looks AND the horsepower!
I have been a loyal Nissan customer for 10-12 years now.  Extremely happy with my dealings with Porter Nissan and am happy with the quality and reliability of the Nissan vehicles I have owned!
Wish the paint hadn't chipped. Wish the fuel economy was better.
I like everything about it except the paint chipping and fuel economy. Could use more space as well.
I've always been a Nissan person.
"Fix the road noise/whistling while driving. This is unacceptable for a new car at any price point, let alone on the Murano Platinum. We've long been loyal Nissan customers. This experience is very disappointing"
Ride and comfort
I need to see if/how my issue gets resolved. How Nissan takes care of this will determine if I'd recommend any more
"Very comfortable, smooth ride"
"Pleased with my vehicle,good quality vehicle"
wish I had cooled seats.
"look, drive, interior, everything..."
It's a beautiful vehicle.
I love the suv
"Vehicle could use slightly better rear blind spot visibility, although the driving aids in the Technology Package help. The steering is a little bit too slow to respond. Options should be offered individually rather than in packages, if possible, especially with the Platinum versus SL Editions."
"Comfortable and quiet; however, i  did not buy the Platinum Edition because of the 20 inch wheels because although larger diameter wheels improve the vehicle's handling and appearance, the lower profile tires are detrimental to the vehicle's ride. In addition, the 20 inch wheels should be unidirectional on each side of the vehicle, like the 18 inch wheels are; in other words, while they look correct on the driver's side, the 20 inch wheels look like they are going in reverse on the passenger's side while the vehicle is not moving."
"I had several problems (mainly financial) with my dealer when I bought my vehicle; also, I did not receive the assistance that I had hoped for for from Nissan when I opened up a case number for the problems that I experienced."
Good car for long trips. Seat comfort is truly exceptional.
Better pickup! Screen over cargo space would be nice like Lexus. Easier navigation setting--changeable while driving - have to stop to change destination! Verbal would be real nice from safety perspective. Better garage door connectivity
Roominess and seat comfort. feels solid.  Lots if safety features. Blind spot identifier - love it!
Quality rating. Comfort of seats/vehicle.   Opinion will change quickly if dealer service is not good -- very important to me and reason Nissan was chosen over local Toyota!
Afraid to let dealer replace windshield. The wind noise is very quite an it may change the quietness. The place where the defect is is distracting for me the driver!
The quietness an ride. Disappointed with the gas mileage. It seems if I drive fast I get better mileage but slow very bad mileage!
Gas mileage an windshield
I wish I could figure out how to use the text messaging feature.
Roominess and comfort on the inside.
I am a BMW lover!!!
"My in town fuel economy is less than the 22 mpg suggested. More like 19. Highway is very close to 28, but I live in rural KY so most of my driving is ""in town."""
Sharp looking! Pacific sun paint is show stopper. Love brown leather. Smooth riding. Intuitive technology. Bluetooth. Safety features and back up camera. Driver seat adjustability.
Overall satisfaction with vehicle and dealership.
Rides smooth and the AWD
I woul recommend a Nissan just not the dealership I went through.
It's my wife's Murano.  She loves it.  This is her 4th Murano.
The look and extras.  Such as all the gadgets.
Over all it is a good product.  We are pleased.  I am on my second Frontier.  My wife is on her 4th Murano.  And we owned a Quest.
Nothing but lower the price
Everything
I like it
nothing love it
smooth ride
"Love the ride, the roominess and all the perks of the vehicle."
Absolutely nothing. I am SOOO happy I took the step to own my new Murano!
Roomy and a very smooth ride.
"It is the most comfortable, easy-to-drive vehicle I've ever owned. I love it!"
The look of the exterior and interior
Love the vehicle
Other than the positioning of the seat with the seat belt clamp there is nothing major to bring to your attention.  I do miss the auto windshield wiper when it rains I liked that it would come on automatically and stop once the rain slowed or stopped.  There is another area where survey questions were not asked.  The Bluetooth system seems to not connect randomly with my cell phone.  My cell phone is brand new so I would not suspect it's the phone but more so the system in the car.  I seem to have the same difficulty with my old 2014 Murano as well.
The performance of the car!  Truly much quieter of a ride.  The body style is so nice.  I love this car!!!
My last Murano was a very reliable car.  I purchased this one because the body style changed so drastically for the better.  The car is solid...looks good...runs like a luxury car has the space of a SUV
"Hard to connect , didn't have this issue with my previous murano"
"Love  the look ,comfortable"
I was disappointed with some of the items that were removed from the 2017 versus the 2015.  I purchased the same level platinum all wheel drive but added the moon roof and the enhanced safety package.  The 2017 does not have the lit (Murano) kick plate that the 2015 had.  The gas mileage is not as good.  The road noise is more notable.  I had the issue with the rattling bracket ( it was so noticeable that I do not know how it was allowed out of the factory).  The headrest is a concern because it will not adjust but currently meets my wife's requirements.  I did not have any of these types of issues with the 2015.  I am concerned that some of these items are due to cost saving actions by Nissan.  As noted above they are noticed by the end item consumer.
"The styling , comfort and safety features.  The 360 camera system is fantastic."
"I would recommend Nissan because of my experience with the 2015 and this new vehicle.  I have experienced great reliability, it is stylish, comfortable and has great safety features."
Gas mileage could be better
Look and drive
Like the v hi OE but not 100% so I am 8 onreferring
"Nothing, I love it!!"
The slick appearance
It's a very attractive car with great features
My cell phone keeps getting disconnected from my murano and I have to keep connecting it.  Sometimes it won't connect at all.  I have an iphone 6S.
The ride
I like it
I am very satisfied with my vehicle
mileage
"It is very quiet, I like the blind spot alarms."
Rear truck is hard to close tight.   Can't exit backup camera when in reverse.   some navigation features can't be accessed while driving.  Understand distraction for driver but passagenger can't use either.   Needs more cup holders.   Steering wheel volume controls should be on right side of wheel.   Power outlets turn off with Ign. But would like to charge devices while not in car.   USB ports don't provide enough power for iPads.
Very roomy.   Smooth ride  Easy steering.
Good overall value. Reliability will determine opinion in the long run.
The comfort
I have always owned nissan vehicles and they are dependable.
"I don't care for all the silver trim. Would make the glovebox a little roomier,"
I like the tailgate lift and the cameras with the warning of someone Or something in the path of the vehicle and that you have the red this year.
"My previous Murano that I owned which was a 2009 was an awesome car. Other then normal maintenance, I had absolutely no problems at all. It was my dream car, the only things I did like on is was, it had no tailgate lift."
I am perfectly happy with everything on my vehicle
The comfortable ride and the room
I have always heard good things about Nissan vehicles
"Really love the car, my only concern may be the wear of the leather seats over time."
I love the technology features.
"From the research, sales, purchase, and now owning the Murano it has been a great experience."
I have more problems than the ones listed here. The blind spot sensor on the passenger side hardly works like it is supposed to. The muffler (I think) is sagging down very badly in the rear on the undercarriage. The A/C system sometimes does not illuminate like it is supposed to. The windshield crack a few weeks ago after turning the vehicle on to warm up the engine and cool down the cab. I was told this would not be covered on my bumper to bumper warranty and I am extremely upset about that. I do not feel this is how I should be treated or how I would like my vehicle to operate when spending as much money as I did. I would like all these issues resolved. The gas mileage has almost never went over 21 miles per gallon. The back where the trunk of the vehicle opens has not opened from pressing the button a few times but is currently working now. It needs to be reported. I need a resolution to all my issues.
It is a beautiful vehicle
No help
Excellent chice
Driving it
I really think it's a great option for what I need...
"great ride, beautiful interior, V6"
Appearance and smooth ride.
"Have owned 3 Nissans, very satisfied.  Would not recommend Peoria Nissan dealer in Peoria AZ."
The only feature I would like to see improved is the Blue tooth technology. It is cumbersome to switch between phones.
Safety features in this car are awesome.  And the interior is beautiful.  Just overall love it.
"Again, safety features and comfort."
Boom
Because I believe it is a great car.
"Great company and a outstanding, good looking product"
we like the car very much and have always had a great experience purchasing at Santa Maria Nissan.
Because I do not give 10s very often
"none, my vehicle is Heaven!"
"Everything it has to offer, really great!"
its been awesome so I can't say enough about it!
just about every thing.
"great price, great suv overall"
"Cargo Cover is weird and could have allowed for a forward or rear position to be used.  Storage is not as efficient as it could be for a vehicle of this size.  The place and connect for a cell phone is weird and could have been better.  The Sirrus stock report should be indices and not individual stocks: this is better on a cell phone.  The jack handle and lug wrench are just enough. I bought a ""scissor jack adapter"" so that I could use a 1/2"" socket drive (either speed drive or ratchet). I also bought a 1/2"" drive long bar and 13/16"" deep socket. I put a rubber pad on top of the jack. This problem is solved."
I love the look and it is nice to drive. The cameras are a big help in parking. I also like that not everyone has one.
It is how much I like it.
An extra pocket in the back seat.
Good ride.
The matts that came with the car - after on lt 900 miles of driving are shreading!  The cargo area is much smaller than our 2014 Muran0
Nice car!
nice luxurious car and nor too pricy
N/A
Style
Awesome quality
"The drive is wonderful, the seats are fantastic!"
It is everything I thought I would be getting :)
Nothing at this time.  Beautiful vehicle.
Design inside and out.
One the best values and appearance and quality built.
Everything
Excellent choice for driving.
The vehicle looks great and drives well.  The technology inside is wonderful for the price.
I love my new Murano.  I have had nothing but compliments on its looks and technological features. I was also pleased with the dealership and its knowledge about Nissan.  This gave me confidence in my purchase.
"The area where the gearshift and drink areas are located could be designed better to accommodate other items more easily that you need to get to readily such as reading glasses, notepad, pen, etc.  The closed storage area is very nice."
The smooth ride!
Great vehicle!
Not a thing
Everything
Great car and sales staff
Vehicle should have the capability to voice text with all smartphones
"Roominess, comfortable, easy to drive"
Just really love how my Murano drives. Very comfortable car.
The visibility in back of car is very hard to see out.
Overall a very comfortable car too ride in and drive.
MY NEW MURANO IS EXCELLENT     LOVE MY NEW CAR SO FAR     3000 MILES
COMFORT AND TRANSMISSION
I ALREADY HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO SEVERAL FRIENDS AND THE ALL SEEM TO LOVE MINE TOO
Love my murano!!  Wanted a Lexus but once I saw the murano and the price we bought!
Everything
The quality and performance.  Live all the text and phone features as well
Train Nissan employees not to discriminate against people based on race and religion. If they are anti- semetic they should keep it to themselves. Educate your salespeople with regard to the workings of your cars. They were ignorant about the bluetooth system and I was forced to return to hill Nissan 6 times and the problem was still never resolved until I contacted www.NissanUSA.com
"I am, and have been  so enraged, and disappointed with this dealer that I find it hard to like anything over anything else in my vehicle.  This was an awful buying experience.  I do not believe that I would ever purchase another Nissan from this dealership. I welcome a call about my experience  at 863 259 9489"
This is the only dealer within 30 miles of me and I would not put my friends through the misery of having to deal with this franchise. It's very hard for me to enjoy this new car when the entire purchasing and set process was and still is such a pain in the behind to get don. Today id May 30th and I still have no Blue tooth. Once I am finished with setting up and paring the car I might start to enjoy driving it. I'll let you know.
ride and styling
great vehicle
Nothing so far other than getting used to limited rear view window.
Comfort and technology. V6 engine.
Quality SUV.
"Love the overall exterior appearance, lines etc."
"I enjoy my vehicle, nearest dealer is 50 miles from my home so service is only issue and feel as if I am missing on services provided by limited hours available to visit service department."
Placement of handle to grab onto on passenger side is too far back .  Overall love it!  Would like the lane signal when you drift over the lane lines on each side.
The look of the interior and exterior.  The comfort of the seating space.  Not much I don't like.
Just overall love it!
"Slightly more power in audio system would be nice.  Sound quality is good but would like to turn it a bit higher at times.  I also think rear storage area could be larger.  If I had one hesitation about buying this vehicle, that was it.  The vehicles I shopped against it had more space in the rear.  Overall, I think the quality of this vehicle attracted me over the others."
"Ride comfort, quality of sound system.  This is my first CVT and I was concerned about that at first but the V6 and transmission work really well together."
Only my 2nd Nissan that I have owned.
Seat belt in back seat doesn't work. had trouble with plastic coming off inside the door frame of passenger and back seats.
safety
The quality isn't there for the price of the car.
Great product.  Reliable beautiful
I've had three Rogues before moving up to the Murano. There are some features on the Rogues that I wish the Murano had. 1. The flexibility to have the flip up in the rear.  I used that a lot to corral grocery bags. 2. Heated steering wheel. 3. I liked the Nav system in the Rogue way better than the Murano.
"I love the exterior styling and the smooth ride and feel of the Murano.  It feels luxurious and my 17 year old said that ""This car drives the way you THINK a car should drive"". High praise.  I also loved the Nissan Lease deal I was offered that allowed me to upgrade to the Murano - which has always been my dream car. (That and a McLaren F1 or a Bugatti Veyron, but they are a wee bit out of my price range)"
"The issues I've had with my Murano are slight.  The company has a fantastic reputation and out of the last four vehicles we've had, we've had very, very little to complain about.  No major issues at all.  In fact, when I bought my first Rogue, Nissan said they had heard that people were concerned about the, new at the time, Continuously Variable Transmission.  They extended my warranty to stand behind the vehicle.  That won my respect.  My husband drives a Pathfinder and loves it - though he wishes the new ones had not changed from the truck platform.  Overall Nissan has our loyalty"
just like it very much
This Murano is a joy to operate.  It is still fun to drive.
The vehicle is put together well.  It is large enough without causing problems getting into my garage.  The seats are very comfortable and I anticipate they will work well on a long trip.  The car looks good and drives good.
The Nissan is a fun car to drive.  It is very comfortable to be in with plenty of space when you lower the back seats for whatever you need to move.
Love the car so far.  The A/C is not as strong as we would like.
Overall a very good comfortable car.
Haven't had it that long yet.  Will need more time to see if problems develop.
very happy
Because is very good car
"I would love for my exterior rear view mirrors to fold in with the touch of a button, as my old car did. Also, I would like for my radio to continue to play after the ignition has been turn off(10 minutes), as my old car did. And, I would like for my windshield wipers to engage automatically when it starts to rain(as my old car did). It sounds like I should have kept my old car, doesn't it?"
Gas mileage.
I don't feel it rides as smoothly as my previous car.
"I love the car, just need to fix the rattle mentioned earlier in this survey, and all is great.  Thanks..."
"Very peppy, lots of acceleration, and love the technology package.  I also love the comfort and look."
"Great experience, great car, very pleased with it.  I have owned Nissans for over 20 years."
Replace the seats or seat covers
"Had morano before but the millage per gallon still about the same as my 2006 model, Need to do better in 10years"
"It is a good car, could be better"
For the price I'm paying I expect the vehicle's features to work for example Bluetooth connectivity....
The exterior....
Because it's very competitive with other brands.
"Annoying buzz when opening door to exit after turning off engine. Unnecessary..  I had the horn sounding, whenever pressing 'lock' mutted. Very annoying noise."
"Handling, appearance, size, multi features as driving aids.  Verbal commands, nav system,"
I think that's a positive rating. I don't normally talk to people about my car. If we have a discussion I'm positive and they should react to that.
looks of it
Love it.  It's a beautiful vehicle.
I like it.
I love it.
I have no problem with my car.i love it
I feel that the Nissan dealership has been as helpful as they could be but Nissan corporate has been deplorable in my attempt to have my problem resolved. I have had my Murano for almost three months and have gotten no closer to having an end to this. I will not buy another Nissan!
Not sure!
My disappointment in not getting any kind of resolution to my problem!
"The V6 engine is excellent; very peppy.  The technology is very updated, too."
"This is the third Nissan car I've owned (fourth if you count an Infiniti).  They are extremely reliable, and performance and service are excellent."
Everything
I like the vehicle
From day one the only issue I have was and still is the  Remote control starter and door locks remote .  One works the other doesn't never worked properly .  We tried to reset it when we first bought it and it still wasn't right
"The look , the drive"
"Friendly service dept, awesome sales department. Clean and fast services"
Build more of the same
Has everything I can possibly want in a new car....I gave up a qx70s Infiniti ... Lots more room in the murano
"My family has own 18 cars and trucks over the years and the just keep making them better, I've own two one is still running with over 400k on original engine ..."
i liked the exterior color and the interior
its a good solid dependable vehicle. the body has gotten better thru out the years
still to new to say...try me in 3-4 months
smooth ride and spaciousness
Nissan product is dependable and presents a good appearance (interior & exterior)...the service department is excellent. (Nisssan customer for 27 years)
Most top of the line of trucks have apple car play. This does nor

Does not have features that other trucks have

EVERYTHING
this is my 4th Nissan lease - love them!
"the vehicle is excellent, if I could have everything I would want lane detection and automatic stopping forward and reverse."
"Looks great, is very quite and the gas mileage is better than my 2004 Murano by 3-4 mpg with is great!"
Great vehicle
"The comfort of the seats,the leg room, and the pick up moving into traffic is excellent."
Othing iz perfe t in this world.
They didn't Transfer my pa plates. Got new one instead. Took 3 months to do it. NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT! !!
Ok
Good suv
"Hatch cargo cover. Bought cover and I do not like it. It is stiff, difficult to use and quite honestly, It will just take up space in the garage."
"I love the design, improved electronics. I truly can not find anything wrong"
Great quality
I like it
2015 & 2017.5 both have rattles and the climate control is wacky. My 2010 & 2012 Muranos you could set the temp at 74 and never touch it. 2015 & 2017.5 you need to set it to 64 in the morning and 78 in the evening?
Sexy and many features and a good price.
Too many rattles and little stuff in my last 2.
There is nothing at this time.
"The color, style, and safety features."
I would not recommend anything that I didn't like or was not not pleased with.
I love this vehicle.
"I like the roominess of the interior, the handling and the sportiness"
"I actually explained it in the last answer.  I like the roominess, the handling and the sportiness of the exterior."
"Need a lot of improvement in the sound system. Very poor bass, better access to control the speaker system not just the basic ( F R or L R )"
The  sport looking exterior
Nissan needs to improve in many places of the vehicles
Nothing.....love the vehicle
Love the car
1. the license plate holder rattles with only 2 screws to hold it in place.  2.The gas door opener and hood release could be in a more visible location.  3. A better tactile design for the tail gate opener would help.
I am happy with my choice with the salesman help.
interior
I love the look of the Murano and the roominess of the interior.  Very comfortable ride
"Road noice , improve quality of entertainment  system ,better phone connectivity"
Seating and looks  and v6
Engine looks good better seating
Very pleased with Classic Nissan and the Murano for all of the previous ratings.
I love my Murano!
"Interior and exterior appearance, comfortable ride, technology is right in line with what I wanted to have in a vehicle."
"Nissan has an overall good reputation, with solid online reviews. Good value, price for the car."
Put arm rests on seats  Plastic piece that is on driver's seat and comes around front from left side is uncomfortable for leg.
Everything except the two things mentioned previously
Those same items already mentioned
"One thing.  Move the damn drivers seat Heat/A/C control.  It's as if it was put where it is as an afterthought.  You have this beautiful car with great features and a lush interior, but the controls are thrown in with no consideration of how the driver must use it."
I fell in love with this trim level the year it came out.  I love the way it looks driving down the road.
"My last vehicle was a 2003 Xterra that had 180,000 miles on it when I traded it in, I put all but the first 30,000 miles on it.  In the 12 years I drove it it only broke down on me ONCE.  If that's not a reason to recommend a car I don't know what is."
"Better placement of volume up and down button.  Ability to permanently turn off automatic text sent when Bluetooth is connected and a text is received....even after car is shut off and restarted, without having to manually shut it off each time."
The look of the vehicle and the feel of the ride
Personally don't care for some of the other vehicles made by Nissan
exterior
price
We are happy with the vehicle
It is quiet and easy to get into.
It is a good vehicle.
The appearance
So far I have been very pleased
Driver area very tight
"We love our new car!! Seriously the best car we have ever owned. We have been Nissan owners for many years. I love the new luxury feel of the Murano and the way it drives.  Nissan, although very reliable, were more utilitarian in the past. Now we have dependability and luxury. Very Happy Customers!!!"
What is not to like. All of it.
Because we truly love it.
Better Bluetooth connectivity and video should be standard for a 2017 Murano.
"I like the power, comfort, and style of vehicle."
Unfixable Bluetooth problem. Big issue when all media played is using smartphone.
"Very confortable, a lot of space. Feels amazing when driving around the city."
Everything is very good and very comfortable.
That's one of the best cars I've driven in this country.
Electrical outlet in dash board so I can connect front dash cam or/and radar detector
"Performance, appearance and comfort"
In case they like a different car
"I really need my issues to be repaired, also I have a situation where the car gets locked with the keys inside (after exactly 2 min), and that caused a problem with my baby getting locked in the car and I was desperate, since then I called Nissan and they said they need time to look at it, and I can be without transportation"
Exterior appearance and space
I had so many issues so far with this new car that I don't feel comfortable recommending it.  Note: This is my 5th Nissan in 10 years (all brand new from the dealer)
N/a
I love everything
because   I had a one of the sales person was arcane verdelus
"I feel that the vehicle is a stable safe platform, appearance is very good, the cost of the vehicle is very reasonable and the dealer was exceptiomal."
Would like passive lane departure
Drivability
Good value
Good service
Handles and turns well
"overall, I'm quite happy with it. It's just a matter of me taking an hour or two to sit in it with the manual and figure out all the features.  I do find myself learning something new often."
"Comfort, size and all the features, once I figure them all out. :)"
"I don't know about the other vehicles, but I really like the Murano.  I'm glad I bought it"
There is an improvement in the Marano from the last one we owned.
no
Great car
No improvements necessary - it's a great car.
"It's roomy, but still sexy and sleek."
"It performs as advertised - plenty of room, peppy drive, great brakes, sexy appearance."
Little bit more leg room In back seat
Look and smooth ride
Cost
Great
Color combination
Love my Murano
"N/A, Outstanding!"
"Drives great, good looking overall appearance, navigation system, Apple Car Play, ...everything."
"Been driving Nissan Altima company cars for 7 years and very satisfied with appearance, durability, dependability."
everything
cause I like it
"Little small for me, 6' 4"", 311#, but still rides good on long distances. Handles good with good gas mileage"
The looks
Felt anyone would enjoy it
"I have not driven my new car a thousand miles, yet. I purchased it in early spring and drove it for about 5 weeks before putting it under cover for the summer when I drive a Mustang convertible. I will be able to give a better survey in 2018 when I have put more miles on the car. But, for the time I did drive it, I could not have been more pleased. My salesman has also checked on me a couple  of times and I feel free in calling him should I have a problem"
I/we like the inside roominess of the car. We also wanted a car that could carry 4 golf bags and this one does. I still am in the learning process of the other features of the car including the blue tooth and the navigation and sound systems.
"This is our second Nissan Murano and we have enjoyed the first one. Our salesman at Bill Collins had previously sold to my family and we found him to be a fine gentleman. We could not have asked for a better salesman, not pushy, most helpful in setting up my car including the seats, blue tooth and sound system."
Great vehicle and even better service
Drives very well nice car
I have had several and they are great vehicles
The vehicle could have been prepped better
It's a really nice car except for the slight vibration and low humming noise that I hear I like the car
I like the way it looks I like all the stuff inside
"Awesome looking, love the chrome!!"
The space and quality of my interior as well as the sleek and sporty look of the outside.
"My car dealer Rick from the Bedford Nissan took such good care of me, made sure I was truly happy with my purchase, and continues to help me when necessary. I would always recommend that service on top of the high quality vehicles to anyone."
I like my car but not all the surveys
BETTER MILEAGE.
SMOOTH RIDE.
"ROOMINESS, GREAT RIDE."
Nothing at the moment. I am completely satisfied.
Ride
Reliabilty
Overal I am extremely happy with my new Murano. I have not been able to use to GPS/navigation but have google map on my phone and have been using it instead.
"Smooth, quiet ride. Handles very well"
It is a quality vehicle. All of the personnel have been wonderful to deal with.
The air conditioning doesn't seem to get as cold as my last murano.
It's a very smooth ride.  And looks awesome!
"I like the roominess of the vehicle.  I like that you can put the back seats down flat to make more room.  All the added features, no hands phone, 360 degree camera, heated and cooled seats.  I really like the blind spot area light.  Still learning everything this car is capable of."
"I love my Murano!  It's a great car.  I've received a few comments about how much others like the looks of the interior and exterior.  The only thing that would be nice to be able to change is the headrest.  I'm short and the headrest is a little off for me.  Unfortunately, I have neck problems so I notice and feel if my neck is being pushed forward even the slightest."
"The interior.  I like the upgrade from the 2015 model with the interior lights, etc."
I think the Murano is a great car but there are higher end models out there and the people I work with can afford anything they want.
I'd like to see a little better gas mileage.
Everything!  This is my 3rd Murano and they've been excellent vehicles.
"Reliability, safety, appearance, price point"
Visibility
No comment
Front seat belt a bit hard to reach
Looks. Interior looks and quality
No body is perfect
"There is very little storage right next to the driver. I am a woman and carry a purse. If there is someone in the passenger seat, I have to put my purse in the back seat which make it tough to access if I need to get something out (e.g., sunglasses or cash). I feel just a bit claustrophobic in the drivers seat.    Larger gas tank. I feel like I am always filling up.    The design of the hood, with the bend down right next to the windshield, reflects the sun right in my eyes if the sun is at just the right angle. I do not care for that design feature."
"Smooth ride (ride, shifting, braking). Love the smart cruise control that slows down if you get too close to the car in front of you. Really love the blind spot warning - it has already saved me a few times!"
My daughter has a Nissan Altima and has really loved it. I like my Nissan Murano so far. I have heard they are great cars and so far have not had any significant issues (other than Bluetooth connectivity).
Appearance is very nice. Drives smoothly. Great interior options.
I like the looks and feel of driving the Murano. It has great interior features. the care handles well.
"First, I would not buy a vehicle with an all black interior again.  It is hot in the summer in Minnesota.  And it gets really dusty.  The quality of the materials is outstanding though.  And, I would be sure the driver's seat would have a tilt feature (Forward, higher, then tilt the front down).  My friend, who is tall and heavy, was super impressed with the generous size of the seats.  I think the 2017 Murano is really exceptional overall."
"The large screen, the surround vision and the lines of the parking lot so I know I am not too close to the other cars.  Other people tell me ""I wish I had that !""  I suppose this sounds fussy, but I liked the front of my Jeep better.  The front actually goes over the curb onto sidewalks and interferes with walking area.  I prefer a boxier front.  Where there is curb and grass going uphill the front hits the grass so the vehicle  has to back up a bit and then stick out in the back.  But the looks of it can't be beat.  I have had people walk around it in the parking lot and I can tell they are impressed.  It is a fancy looking vehicle.  Mine has a lot of chrome.  I have always liked the Nissan taillights."
"It is definitely a lot for the money--looks, technology, ease of driving, ease of control, spacious, etc.  I test drove other vehicles and every time I see them on the road, I am so happy I chose the Murano.  And, we thought Wayzata Nissan (MN) was very thorough in explaining every single thing from figuring out what we wanted to what they had to offer to the financing.   And the salesman set up my map stuff.  The people who work there are terrific and that is why my son insisted we go there.  He had bought a vehicle there.  It is a top notch dealership, which in my mind is very important."
Maybe the Computer system.  The satellite radio sometimes acts up.
The fuel effeciency is better than my previous vehicle.
This is my second Nissan.  Overall I was extremely happy with my Previous Nissan automobile.
It's fun to drive
don't give 10s
Move ignition switch/button to same location as 2010 Murano
Driving comfort
The seat rubs against the center console and makes a noise.
The overall comfort is great
I am very pleased and satisfied when I sit in other suvs.
I had a 2007 Murano and though it is a shorted vehicle it had more rear storage.  The slope of the back of the vehicle is too steep to accommodate larger items in the rear. I have also noticed some road noise that I would have thought would have been eliminated with a newer vehicle
The looks and the feel of the vehicle.
I like the looks of the entire line that they have for 2017.
Lower price? Better standard warranty. Larger cargo area.
"Styling, comfort."
Don't feel it's a good value for the money and visibility is bad.
Nothing! No problems as of today. Still learning about all the accessories. Will let you know if I begin to have issues.
"To be honest, what I like most is the Customer Service I received from Gerald Nissan when purchasing. Howard Krick (salesman) was outstanding and Kevin in Finance was outstanding. I only go to Gerald Nissan because of the outstanding customer service that they provide. Anthony in the service department is outstanding. I know if I run into any issue it will be addressed immediately. Thank you Gerald Nissan of Naperville!"
For all the reasons I mentioned previously. Plus - I would only recommend to Gerald Nissan of Naperville
Smooth ride and technological innovation
Quality
l e d headlights           illuminated garage door opener switch
the exterior design
driver side seat belt very close to body. Silver trim inside car reflect in outside mirrors
The new styling
I like the way the car handles. continue transmission light on inside car when other vehicles are in blind spot.
Center trim at bottom of steering wheel too sharp. Needs more rounding for those of us that steer from bottom.  Would have liked interior rear hatch release.  Hatch is too heavy for my wife to close properly.
Style
This is my second Nissan. First gave excellent service till totaled in accident. Didn't seriously consider any other brand.
"I love the look of my Murano, inside and out."
I've had a great experience so far.
Comfort and interior space
It has to do with the two issues.
The car has met my expectations
Nothing
Body style and how it handles on the road.
Because of its overall handling.
"Resolve the issue with the navigation , sound and Bluetooth.  I should not be having these issues just one or two months in."
Interior room and exterior appearance
"I am not certain that this is not a common problem, therefore, I could not recommend something unless I am sure that it is dependable.  Navigation not working is a serious problem when I am in need of it."
My issue is a manufacturing issue. The dealership was great and the salesman was awesome. If I would have asked about this issue I would have known.
Great product. I like everything but the stereo issue and I should have upgraded to have built in garage door opener. If I would have drove the car for a day I would have known what I needed before the purchased. They offered but I said no.
ajustable height for passengers seat.
it is all very nice
it is a nice vehicle.
Good vehicle. Usually only have problems with dealer honesty
It's a great car
Wife's friend bought a Rouge because she said Nissan was good product
"I don't think the items below can improve ""This"" vehicle, however, for future models there is hope.  When you use the exterior door handle and release it, it sounds hollow inside the door.  My previous cars have felt quieter like more sound deadening used. The sound of the door handle sounds cheap.  I would also appreciate a little less road noise.  I like the new exterior styling of the Murano from previous models, however, the front grill doesn't really do it for me."
"I love the height it is easy to get into and out of.  I like the comfortable seating, the interior accent lighting and the features that the Platinum model provides such as heated steering wheel, heat/cooled seats etc...  I forgot to include in the previous page that I wish it had electric folding side mirrors."
"After researching other vehicles prior to purchase, I was happy with the comfort of the Nissan.  If I am pleased with the vehicle, I would recommend to others.  I also really appreciated ""Ricky"" the salesperson."
Because the back storage area is so deep it would be nice to have some-kind of netting or other device to keep things from sliding around.
It's a quiet and comfortable ride.
"It's a quiet ,comfortable ride with lots of room.  NOTE: I never give a 10 rating."
No improvements
Big enough for new baby.
Great experience so far.
I couldn't check issues on second page.  My 2014 Murano had auto sensors on wipers...the 2017 does not.  Miss that! The bluetooth and Car Play is confusing and difficult to understand.  Wish it was all bluetooth controlled.
Drives beautifully and very comfortable.
I don't give 10.
Love Nissan vehicles.
The comfort of the seats.
My first experience with a Nissan and I really like the style and handling of the vehicle.
the Miles per gallon could improve
the interior roominess and look
because i love my car and would recommend
Look
"Arm rests on the front seats would greatly increase comfort, especially for the driver, as the center console is too far to serve comfortably as an arm rest.  The configuration of the passenger seat also doesn't allow enough leg room if someone is sitting in the back."
The Murano is a good mix of economy and comfort.
"The purchasing experience was excellent, and the sales rep continues to answer questions about the vehicle.  The Nissan finance site is user friendly, making payments is a breeze.  The only reason this isn't a ten is because I have yet to use Nissan maintenance so I don't know how good that sector is."
I think my whole experience is a mess and I don't like nissan
The dealer i did my deal sucks as hell. The worst people work there.
parking cameraplus I love everything about it
I love my car.  Second one I've had
"I would get ride of the idiot lights and put in real time gauges so you can see things like oil pressure, is the battery being charges etc."
"Fuel usage, the ride, the way it handles, the way it looks all the technology features"
This is my 4th.  I like the dependability
I would have like a sound when backing up and get near an object
It is comfortable to drive
It is a nice looking and ride smooth. It was rated as a good car.
Nothing
Comfort
Outstanding vehicle. Great design.
Safety!!!
I LOVE MY CAR!
Its sleek look!
This is my third Nissan....I've never had any issues with them.
Very satisfied with our new car and the salesman that sold our new car was very patience with us in choosing what car to buy .He even went the extra mile by driving the cars that we we intrested  and parking them in the front and letting us choose which car to buy and to look at them for us to decide which would be our best pick.He was very patient with us and that's why we purchased it from Ipac Nissan San Antonio Tx. His name is Latzu Lara. Very good salesman.
The shape of the car . Model . Very luxurious
They gave me very good service and the salesman was very patient with us in choosing our new car .The car is super hot. All my town like it.
I so feel like there is a blind spot but I do have the warning lights when a vehicle is there so getting used to that. Overall I really like my Murano
"Very smooth ride and nice, even acceleration ."
Just the blind spots.
Best cars I've driven
Not a thing....totally pleased with vehicle.
"Style, Electronics and Driving ease.  The driver's seat is absolutely the best in long distance comfort.  Great engineering!!!"
Because of the quality built product and first rate customer service.
Exterior trim package and electronics
It is my 4th Murano and each one gets better than the last one.
Fuel economy could be better.overall great vehicle.
Driveability and looks.
They car good solid vehicles
Paint and auto air / control
Style and comfort
Like it a lot minus paint/air
"Overall I like it, but again the audio sound system, could be a little better than the basic/average model..."
"Looks and color, and the wide tires..."
"Why do, YOU; ask do you think it should be higher...????   Yes, I like Nissan products....., I don't give 10's away that easy..."
The comfort of the interior
Excellent vehicle
"We have truly enjoyed our car.  The gas mileage could be better, but all in all we are very happy with our vehicle."
I feel I'm driving a LEXUS... LOL
"This is the second Nissan vehicle we have purchased. Our nephew, Ricardo Herrera works at the Santa Fe Fiesta Nissan Auto Park and he is the BESTEST MECHANIC IN THE WHOLE WORLD...."
Really like the car
Nothing it's great
It's very reliable and fun to drive
"No beneficial differentiation from competitors.  It's not that I wouldn't recommend Nissan, rather that there's no compelling argument to recommend Nissan"
The seat space is smaller than in our 2 older Murano's because the console is wider. The console is also deeper at the back edge of making it more difficult to reach other areas.
The warning features such as warning me if another vehicle is in my blind spot when I am ready to change lanes.
"Despite the drawbacks I mentioned, it's got a lot of great features. Assuming it is as reliable as our two older Murano's, then would be another reason."
Nothing at all  I love the the murano despite the sensor issue.
The seat comfort is great for my bad back and the ride is so soft
Despite the sensor issue my house hold has owned many nissan vehicles. This is the first time i have had a problem
"Engine responsiveness, safety features, Apple car play"
The most features for the money
Nothing everything is great i love my Nissan
The way it rides
I don't if any of my friends would like a nissan
Better interior features. The sun guard (I think that is what it's purpose is) over the dashboard looks like a big pancake just stuck onto the dashboard. Doesn't mesh with the dashboard at all. The interior trim which is sort of striped looks really plastic-like and really cheap and cheesy. Not sure if the revved up engine on the push button start is normal or is a problem.  Concerned that the brake dust is normal or indicates a problem
"I've had Murano's for 10+ years. My last one was a little disappointing in terms of the road and windshield noise.  But this 2017 Murano is quieter, definitely feels more substantial, i.e.better built, better ride.  My Muranos have always been reliable, love the crossover and being higher off the road than a sedan, This 2017 is a little funkier stylistically than I would usually pick, but overall I've really liked my Muranos so I went with it."
I like crossovers and Muranos have been reliable which is very important to me
"No, the car is great!"
"The ride, and tight handling, much better than my pathfinder ever was...."
Love my crazy!
The Look and the finished quality and attention to detail inside and out!
Great Service and staff....but mostly the product itself.
The only issue I have is the blue tooth constantly dips in and out
The comfort
Overall a great quality car that truly feels high end
Not thrilled with the midnight edition color selection. Certain surfaces show dust and dirt more so than other colors.Silver trim in certain areas are reflected in the side windows and interfere with seeing clearly.
This is the fourth Murano that I have leased and by far the technology is fantastic.  It has a distinctive design and is a pleasure to drive. This is a far cry from the Murano that I leased when they first came out.
Refer to the comments in the last box.
Absolutely love it. Perfect upgrade from my 2014 Maxima.
"The size, power, maneuverability, and tech features."
Best brand out there.
Wish the seat belts were automatic
The 360 camera and the heated seats
I have got very good service .  I have no complaints
Better gas mileage
Beautiful exterior and ride. I love it!
Gas mileage is not great.
"Nothing, I love it, my favorite car yet"
Everything
"Great Service, rates,  reliable cars"
Past bad experience with Nissan customer service
It is fine as is - maybe a little better gas mileage
"basically, everything"
This is my 4th Murano in a row - that speaks for itself
i love it
Replace rim with new one too insure 100percent perfect
Everything
Nice running car
Offer a Sport version with a more performance oriented engine/transmission/suspension and steering wheel mounted paddle shifters.  I would also like to see a 4 year warranty.
Interior/exterior styling
I have only owned the vehicle for several months but so far I am very pleased.  My first Nissan and was not sure what to expect.  My previous experience has been with luxury name plates.
Smooth ride  Recently took a 9 hr trip & it was great
No car is 100 perfect
Long distance comfort
Have already done so
"I am disappointed in the internal storage compared to my last 2 Muranos.  1. no small space under the dash on the center console for quick things like pen, chap stick etc.    2. the Center bin does  not have the small tray that could be accessed instead of the large bin.  Now there is just the large bin (with smaller capacity) making things like reading glasses, mints change harder to keep organized.  3. the door compartments are smaller and things fall out of them easily.  My 2007 Murano had a ""pop out"" feature making it much easier to get to things in the door. That was gone in the 2013 and missed it.  4. Small drawer behind the center console is gone.  Not a big deal for me but still was a nice feature.  5. the eye glass holder on the roof is a little smaller then the 2013.  6. Glove compartment is narrower then last one.  the 2013 was GREAT!  Kept a folder in there with necessary paper work, Handicap placard for Mom...etc.  Folder no longer fits.    Overall....I love my new Murano!  As I said, this is my 3rd and I will continue to buy Muranos despite the above statements.  They are just nuisance items."
"Great ride.  handles like a charm.  Love the camera for parking, backup etc.    Just drove a 2000 mile trip and got great milage.  Beautiful!!"
It is a great care.  No problems with my last 2 or this one.
"I like the appearance of my vehicle, the functionality, and the performance."
So far my vehicle is performing well.
I like my overall buying expertise and the salesman were great.
The 0 gravity seats and navigation system
Because I love my Nissan and I am glad I got it.
The stearring is not great on turns
bluetooth volume varies widely...Auto-braking slammed on brakes when it thought there was a vehicle in front of me.
Level of technology and visual finish
Always room for improvement
They could have helped out a person who bought a brand new car. The experience with service although was not horrible could have used some brushing up.   The whole experience was not great buying a new car that was too bad. Although unavoidable parts of it were not great   This was my second new car / truck buying in a period of one month. I changed my mind on a truck after this experience went with another company
The car is amazing everything except the bad part at the time of delivery
It was a great value appointments far above the cost
Excellent Job!!
Everything
I love Nissan
"I love my new car but the issue of voice recognition is bug, I am frequently on the phone while driving calling customers or colleagues.  The strength required for the steering wheel has resulted in pain after driving for a long period.  I did not mention before the driver seat seems to have the hard plastic (front part of the bucket sticking out more than the passenger seat"
"Smooth ride, classy and elegant interior, great interior and exterior"
Because of my outstanding issues and not sure yet how will Nissan take care of them
"Cooled seats, heated steering wheel, panaromic moonroof, how quiet it is to drive and overall comfort of the seats, attractiveness of the car"
I really like my new car and had a great buying experience. The service department I visited after my purchase has been a less than stellar experience.
More storage/trunk space.
"The look, exterior and features  Special edition and won t see to many others on the road"
This is my fourth Nissan.   I need not say anything else
Better gas mileage!
Comfortable seats!
Gas mileage.
Add lane departure warning feature. Lower the front lights' angle so that other people won't think I am using the high beam but actually I am not.
The comfortable and quietness.
This is my first time to buy Nissan cars but it came with problems that need to be fixed by changing the hardware. So I am disappointed with the quality and the service manager promised me to give me some compensation but have never reached me.
I have 2 improvements to suggest.  1) From the driver's seat it is difficult to adequately see through the passenger's windows (both front and rear) when making a right turn.  It's hard to get a clear view if any traffic is coming from the right. 2) I know it's a safety feature but I wish I didn't have to push the door unlock button to let people out of the car between the time that I put the car in park and shut off the ignition.  Perhaps there is a way to turn this feature off that I haven't found.
The comfort of driving it and of getting in and out of it.
"Great styling, very good quality, great safety features, and nice technical/audio features."
"I think this is an excellent car, but there are a few things that would make it better, especially with the cost of the car. Rain sensing wipers would be a nice feature. I've had this in other similar priced vehicles. ""Puddle"" lights that illuminate on the exterior when nearing the car at night. Audible beeping sound when backing up or pulling into a parking space. The camera view is great, but having an audible beeping would make this feature even better. Cruise control that doesn't have to be turned on every time the car is started. Also, it would be an improvement if the following distance for the adaptive cruise control could be configured and saved in settings rather than having to set it every cruise control is turned on."
I like the comfort and look of the vehicle
I think that Nissan Murano is a good vehicle.
The drivers door at unlatch is not smooth and front passenger door is near the same. Both rear doors are OK.  I am a easy door closer; cannot stand someone slamming a car door.  Both front doors require a firm shut.  In my case I am closing the door several times.  There is an exhaust pipe bracket that hangs low on all these Muranos. I like looking at the duel exhaust but that bracket bugs me.  I have painted it flat black with heat resistance paint making it less noticeable.
"The interior, the outside styling and the bold feeling of the vehicle when driving."
Good value for the price range.
GIVE MORE WARRANTY ON TRANS. BETTER VIEW FROM DRIVERS SEAT MY WIFE IS SHORT AND WHEN SHE LOOKS OUT OF THE WINDOW SHE IS LOOKING INTO REAR VIEW MIRROR. MIRROR IS MOUNTED TOO HIGH.
SOUND SYSTEM
TRANS WILL NOT HOLD UP
I would like the two issues fixed without interruption to my daily schedule.  Maybe a loaner car.
Appearance
"Since I have had two issues with a brand new car, I am a little concerned about its longevity.  Actually, I am quite worried."
Comfort
"We have owned over the years a Versa, Sentra, Xterra, Juke and now Murano and have appreciated the overall functionality for the different phases in our life."
"Comfortable, performance  & reliable"
"Comfortable, performance and reliable"
Need to have a better delivery ! A delivery worthy of someone spending $45 k + on one of your vehicles.
Looks
"I am not a fan of negotiating on new cars , I don't like the whole process from front not knowing if you are getting screwed to back financing."
I wish that with a backup camera the Murano also had audio alert features built into the bumpers.  Most cars in this price range seem to have the audio alerts as well as the camera.
The appearance is tops.
For a vehicle in this price range it is missing some key features such as audio alerts (for backup) and the sound system should perform at a higher level.
"The buttons for the driver seat memory should be moved down. If the driver gets it, closes the door, his/her knee hits the button and moves the seat unintentionally."
excellent gas mileage
"The Murano is an outstanding vehicle.  The ride is extremely comfortable.  Just got back from a 4,000 mile trip.  The vehicle was exceptional.  I will definitely tell my friends and family about this vehicle."
"Since my answers were ""all truly exceptional"", the statement above isn't applicable."
the ride is very smooth.
"Again, since all of my answers to every question was truly exceptional, there are my reasons for recommending a Nissan if asked."
Nothing right now.
Overall package.
Because nothing is a 9 or a 10
"Not sure, more attention to detail and function."
"GPS, camera, lane changing alarm"
See complaints above!
Love my Murano!
The sound system could have a much better sub woofer.   The roof could have been cleaned better. I guess the glue from the protection cover wasn't completely removed.
"Appearance, size, and technology."
I like it.
The drivers seat should be longer.  There is a piece on the driver seat that runs my leg.  It's a plastic piece that I believe wouldn't be a problem if the seat was longer or had the extension on it that my Maxima had.
It's a beautiful vehicle that has all the bells and whistles I like.  I particularly love the safety features.
I am a Nissan fan.  This is my 8th nissan.  They are dependable vehicles.
Not as quiet inside as I expected.
Everything else!
Great vehicle
"Basic things: no place for a woman to store her purse unless it is in the back seat if there is a passenger in the passenger seat.  The pick up is slow in comparison, but I believe it is due to the weight of the vehicle, something to adjust to or just mention to work on. Steering is very tight - another adjustment."
The fact that it is a SUV. Bigger vehicle. Back up camera. Blind spot device.   Wish it had auto wipers.
"The dealership. Liked the salesman, but had issues with the overall dealership"
I love my car!
No rattling.
The size.
The car has been reliable so far and has a great appearance.
"I absolutely love my Murano. I don't think it could get much better. With the exception of thinking all cars come with the Direct Connect System. Which I learned about after I had it a few weeks and tried to get GPS on it. For 32,000$ it should have been a standard feature ."
Everything
"I love everything about it. How it drives, handles, looks and it's comfort for all passengers."
The murano is the best luxury car!!
better fuel economy
comfort of ride and comfort of seats.  The seats are fantastic
So far great experience  no issues with the car
drive is smooth and is beautiful car
I have been a loyal customer for many years and have always had good vehicles and service.
"It would help if it had better gas mileage, a bit more interior room, and a bit more engine pickup"
The seats
The negatives I mentioned
all vehicals should be hybrids in 2018 and  or electic with 300 mile range by 2020
comfort and reliability
The last  three Nissans I have owned never had a recall or any problem whatsoever. Great cars and suvs
I love it. My 2014 Murano had terrible blind spot. The features on 2017 are great
Comfortable ride
This is my third Murano!!!! Does that explain?
Vehicle transmission is not smooth down shifting. Mileage could be better.
The vehicle is very stylish and i have had no issues with the vehicle. The dealership was very good to deal with.
"Hands free texting needs to work, biggest issue I have.   Get up and go needs to be smoother."
"great ride, good millage, beautiful car"
"I have owned nothing but Nissan and I have found them to be very reliable, durable and long lasting.   I had the Nissan Quest for 8 years, only issue ever was my son totaled it."
Safety features and gps system
Satisfied overall but disappointed that the ride is harder than I expected.
Wish I had automatic feature to turn outdoor mirrors in/out when parking.  I bought the Platinum level and was surprised to learn that I would have to manually push my mirrors in.  Had those on my MKC and loved them.
"This is my second Murano.  I went back to it because it performed well (no issues over 6 years); it's dependable, a good road car for trips bc the seats are comfortable, and it's always been my favorite car.  I especially liked the updated exterior of this car with the LED lights, wheel covers, etc."
It's the third one I've had and I've never had any major mechanical or technical issues in any of them.  It's always been very dependable.
Would have liked navigation system in the car as well as side sensor for car near by. also would have liked for the display to be touch screen.
still doesn't have as much technology as i would like.
Vehicle awesome!
Handling and looks
Great driving vehicle and sales staff was great.  Dealership slow to payoff trade in which caused issues with bank on trade in.
Nissanconnect should be added to this Murano.
Comfort
I drove an Altima for 13 years before buying the Murano.
Nissan builds high quality and reliable carsi
My biggest complaint is the placement and size of the air conditioning vents for the front and back seats. In 110 summertime When it is boiling and the sun is beating down it will take too long to cool off and stay cool without having the air conditioner blower on high. We have already had to have it turned on high and it is only June and  88 to 90  The problem with this is that when it is full blast it is then very loud and you can't hear a thing.        My second complaint was being told I could add the DVD player with that DVD screen in the head rest backs after I purchased it which I learned upon taking it to the dealership is not possible.  I feel like I was told this just to make the sale.
It's a beautiful well-made car that drives wonderfully.
It would depend on the climate my friend lived in.  If a hot and humid climate like myself I would tell them to look for one that has a larger air conditioning vents or more air conditioning vents. And to make sure to question everything their salesman tells them and get answers from a second source to make sure they match.
Everything was perfect! Especially our salesman Shane! He was wonderful! He was the main reason we chose Nissan!
Everything!
Customer Service
"It would be very helpful to offer classes/clinic showing how to operate all the technological features on the car. The manual is helpful, but hands-on would be better."
"I love the comfort of the driver's seat, how the car handles, and the ease of driving."
"The Murano has a very solid feel, handles beautifully and is very comfortable. I have back trouble and the seat and lumbar support give me the support I need."
The car arrived with scratch's and marks that I was so excited at first that I was willing to overlook but now I'm really annoyed by it.
"The V6, roominesss, and styling."
I love Nissan. I had Rogue before and enjoyed it as well. They are quality cars that are reliable and fun to drive.
I think it could be a little more roomier for the price.
The seat color and the way it drives.
At the dealership that we use the people are always friendly and I don't buy anything else but Nissan vehichles
I would of loved for the Murano to have the features: park assist for parallel parking and being able to open the rear door with your foot.
"its has a great look (style), very comfortable and great on gas."
I have always got quality vehicles that last long with Nissan and the dealer (Supreme Nissan of Slidell) where I purchased my vehicle was great.  They are very tentative to my needs and very friendly staff.
"Raise it a little bit more so it does not hit the ground when going over bumps. The AC noice is too much. The door compartments are too small, it hardly can hold a cup. No sound warning when close to an object while backing up.  I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE MORE."
The interior mocha seats.  The front alert when close to the vehicle in front of you.
"I have always liked Nissan, so having this experience with my choice of car does not really change my opinion of them having durability with their products."
"Air conditioning, doesn't feel cool enough unless vents are blowing directly on you. If vent is not directly on you, fan must be all the way up."
"Smooth ride, quiet,"
Like it
Stereo overall sound quality could be improved
I like just about everything. Very pleased
"Quality, appearance,handling, technology"
Nothing. I love m new vehicle.
How it drives and the overall looks.
For the price you get all the quality that you would with a Lincoln but it handles better and looks better. More comfortable then the Ford.
"When turning right, it would be beneficial if the camera came on to show clearances, proximity, etc."
Solid feel and technology
I love it!
"Not a thing. Using the new car as a ""spare"" so we have not driven it a lot. Took a 1200 mile trip recently with 4 of us and all went well. Two in the back were very comfortable, and we love the front seats."
Bought the Murano because of the styling. The chrome trim on the Windows and the chrome and black-out between the wheels is unique. Love it.
"Second Nissan, have 2007 Maxima that we are still driving after 157k miles with only normal maintenance. Body and interior still in great shape also. Hope to have as good of service with the Murano."
All ok
Appearance
Nice vehicle
luxurious feel in an affordable package
"It's not a ""Quiet"" ride which is surprising to me.  I have to adjust the radio volume (higher) when reaching higher speeds.  Somewhat surprised about this.  Getting used to the AC system. The fan on the highest speed could push out more air volume.  I could be that I'm not using it correctly wnich I will ask about during my 5000 mile Oil change."
"The ride and handling.  It rides and responds like my Buick Lucerne, which is great."
See previous comments
"At this point, I wish I had realized the ride would not be as soft with the Midnight Edition- This was not made clear to me so I purchased it and now wish I had gotten the Murano Premium with premium wheels for a better ride.  I have also been very frustrated with quality of the dealership where I made the purchase and regret not having stayed with Tom Wood where I had excellent experience with my VW Passat until having to trade it due to diesel issue."
"I like the style of the vehicle, the seating and the ease of use of the different automatic access and safety alerts."
"I would actually recommend Nissan from a different dealer- I had a new Altima before and it was awesome.  I just need Nissan to care about the dealer issues that have led to dissatisfaction and help resolve them.  I have cancelled purchase of the protection pkg. they messed up. While hesitant to work with them, will take the car in for the chip to be fixed.  Then will follow up elsewhere for warranty.  If Nissan could extend an offer to change to wheels/tires, it would also help."
"Fix rear door hard to close. Fix little trimming defects. I will ask the dealer to do that when I take the car for the first oil change.  The fuel consumption is really bothering me, so if there is any way of reprogramming the engine to be ""less thirsty"", that would be really great."
"Comfortable, high tech, really nice looking, safe."
"Because I really don't like the fuel consumption, but it probably doesn't bother most people."
"You guys did a good job on styling and features, however I feel some attachments like visors, sun glasses pocket door do not appear very robust     No complaints, good value overall"
"I will never go back to a non heated steering wheel, I didn't know I needed one"
Overall experience through out
"Possibly a closer connection with the dealership.  While not  impossible, it's inconvenient to drive the 30 miles to the dealership.  So, for the most part, I live with it for now.  Have not as yet had the first oil change for this car."
Seating position and the fact that it is a new car.
"In the category of ""nice"" cars, there are many many fine choices from which consumers can choose.  Certainly, Nissan is one of them.  I am 82 years old and this is my first ever Nissan vehicle.  I would not hesitate to recommend same if asked."
Steering feels way too light. Comparing to my wifes CX-5 she has a much better steering response and input. The Murano seems to require frequent input and is sluggish.
"Tech.    Was considering an Audi SQ5, but did not have anywhere near the same tech unless held out for 17 models with virtual cockpit, then it would have one upped. But was missing adaptive cruise, etc."
I think I
Love the interior. I have the mocha interior. Definitely a smoother ride than the Rogue. I'm glad I traded in my Togue fir the Murano.
"The Murano is just a beautiful vehicle. Very sleek and sophisticated. I absolutely love this vehicle. Next tomy Acura TSX, this is my favorite vehicle."
Storage areas small and not effective.
Style
It's  my preference.  Might not fit them
Better gas mileage is my only real gripe so far.
The interior look and feel is great. And the seats are very comfortable.
Because I like my car.
Stereo inputs should be in the center console not in the small compartment directly behind the gearshift. Vehicle should include lane keep assist safety feature. Maps for navigation should update automatically when needed.
"Pleasure to drive, very comfortable."
"Quality product, reliable."
the ride is a little rough could be smoother.
"style of vehicle, camera system, auto fold down back seats."
"some improvements can be made to the auto, but overall the auto is a good value"
"I love the vechicle, but I wish it did better on fuel consumption during city driving."
"The seats, technology, and how easy it handles while driving."
I have been a Nissan owner for over 14 years and I have been happy with each model I can have.
"Taking car back in for a ""body plug"" missing on passenger side panel. This car is noisier than our previous vehicle (road, wind noise). Still it performs very well. I think the lever to open gas tank should be in an easier to use location, and the buttons for garage opener need lights behind them. Difficult to easily see at night."
A great vehicle for the price. Love my dealer! Had to call Nissan financial for help moving due date and they were great!!!
I enjoy driving and riding in my Nissan Murano.
Quality of the vehicle for the price
Feel they offer a quality products
"We have had several Nissans and loved them all, but the Murano is our favorite as far as quality and looks for the money."
no
Unfamiliar with entire lineup.
MY DRIVES THIS THE MOST AND SHE HAS NOT SAID ANYTHING ABOUT PROBLEMS.  IF SHE DOES NOTICE SOME PROBLEM I WILL TAKE TO DEALER
SPACE FOR MY LEGS
NOT HAD LONG ENOUGH
The vehicle is very quiet and offers a nice comfortable ride.
I really like the Murano but wish the gas mileage was higher.
"Seats are very comfy! Features are in line with my previous car, a Cadillac"
My sales rep was great to work with and impressed with my service experience
The technology and interior design
I've owned now 3 different Nissans and feel they are reliable and I like the stylings of exterior and interiors
Better fuel economy.
I like the way it handles and its appearance.
Wish it had rain sensing wipers like previous Murano
Appearance and the comfort of driving it.  Overall its a luxury vehicle w/o luxury price.  Excellent overall vehicle.  This is our fourth Murano!!
We have driven Nissan vehicles for years and have never had any serious issues with any of them.  Quality is the main reason for us plus the appearance of the vehicles.  Nissan vehicles are always ahead of the other manufacturers in looks and performance.
I have no offering
All of the technology in the overall attractiveness
I believe that it is a good purchase
Love it
I PLAN TO DISCUSS WATER LEAK ISSUE AROUND BACK DRIVERS SIDE WINDOW SEAL WITH DEALERSHIP AT TIME OF 1ST SERVICE.
IT IS A NICE VEHICLE THAT OFFERS MANY FEATURES.
Seat belt fabric gets kinked on both passenger and drivers  Side  At times. The drivers seatbelt release is against your thigh unless you push it back.
Interior  And electronics. And camera and size
Great dealership
"This car drives like I look for in a car, do not know you are moving."
This is my third car with Nissan and no complaints what so ever.
the looks and drive
over the years I have purchased several Nissan's and have been pleased with all of them
Ease of lowering the rear seats for cargo space.  I bought the vehicle especially to haul my harp.
The dealership and quality of the vehicles if own.
I love my vehicle and the only changes are what was stated earlier.  Cup holders and windshield wiper sensors
Interior luxury - triple dog love it!
"I have owned 3 Muranos and 2 Frontiers and never had an engine problem and the exterior/interior is more luxurious than the Lexus and Lincolns, but within my budget."
Side mirrors have reflection from trim.  Also sun hits windshield trim and reflects into drivers eyes
I love it.
I love the car
"I love the looks of both interior and exterior.  In a world of SUV's, it stands out in the parking lot.  I love how it handles.  The comfort is outstanding.  There is nothing that I don't like about my Murano."
"I drove a pickup for over 12 years.  I have looked at new vehicles for the last 4 years to replace my truck.  Until I found the Murano, nothing met my needs.  I would recommend the Murano because it fulfills all the things I liked about my truck and all the needs of anyone needing a car."
"There is no rear air vents for passengers or a place to plug in phones in back seat. Very odd. Also, the rear door has to be shut very hard to latch. Other than that it's a good daily driver for me."
It's smooth ride. The exterior design.
It's a little tighter in the backseat than I originally thought. It's smaller for our family than I thought during the 10 minutes test drive. It would be too small for most people I know with children.
Everything!!!!!
I like the car.
Love it
Smooth quite ride
Love it
"I don't think that the Murano should even be offered without the touch navigation screen. Mine is without it, and the screen literally does nothing except display the song playing."
"The Jasper Pearlescent interior trim, very comfortable seats, overall attractiveness."
"Good cars with a good mix of practicality and form, was just a bit disappointed with quality, but still a good quality vehicle."
I love my Murano.  The dealership and sales man were amazing.  It is the third vehicle we have bought from you.  The Murano is the best one.
I feel safe in my vehicle.  The auto braking is the best!!
Because it is the best car on the road.  I love it
"I better inspection on the vehicle before it was offered to sell. Minor/Moderate issues such as the gap (poorly fitting) instrument panel cover, the paint flaws on drivers side rear panel (missing clear coat?), and drivers side door panel/window rattle (possible speaker issue). All issues are not all that acceptable considering the price paid for vehicle and the fact it is a brand new vehicle. There should not have been any issues with the car. I have always purchased nissan, i expect above average products."
"The exterior body style, the interior appearance, the interior spaciousness, and the overall drive of the vehicle.   Significant upgrade from the 2013 Rogue i last purchased."
My previous rogue had a couple of issued that I had a hard time getting Nissan to repair under warranty.
Mpg for city driving is not so good
Operation
I love my murano
Nothing
Looks
It is a good product
Stop putting plastic in cars they squeak and rattle
Style of body and color and design of interior
Not sure if it is worth the price I paid
improve gas mileage or give motor options; I wouldn't mind giving up gas mileage if I had a more responsive engine (like I had in my Maxima)
Exterior/Interior look; Midnight Edition is attractive
I am a repeat Nissan customer and have recommended numerous times.  I didn't rate a 10 as there is always room for improvement.
Don't make them as fast and they shouldn't be a whole lot of problems
It's okay
Purchase two vehicles and had to bring them both back for minor repairs
The sleek looking and feel
"I am very happy with my purchase. therefore, I would recommend this vehicle."
Love the control center and how quiet it drives
I love my car
I have bought 3 Nissans and have not problems so far.
Lower payment and or more features
It is a beautiful car but it's a gas guzzler
It wastes too much gas and payments are to high
just please have the engineers or those who create and assemble the vehicle to put a little more effort into the product.
its attractive to look at
i didn't recommend a 10 based on the issues I've had with the paint.
Include andriod compatibility in nissan connect
The overhead/backwards camera split is really nice for backing up
They are really nice cars
Can't think of anything.
Comfort size price
In the Murano - the place to set drinks is at an incline - sooo it feel/looks like the drink my spill or leak.  Prefer the space to be straight - parallel to straight road.
It's feel on the road - the size - can be seen and see better when parked among other vehicles. Look is gorgeous.  Drive is wonderful.  Inside is very attractive.
Great cars and the dealership and offers are fantastic.  Been driving one for over 10 years. Very very happy with the make.
Fuel economy improvements
"Safety futures, quietness, exterior and interior"
I like it
Everything.  Both me and my wife just love this vehicle.  The size is great and even better is the gas mileage.
Nissan is just a great vehicle.
"There is a shipping plastic'ish sticker that is attached to the windshield about 3/4 of the way down from the top of right side of the windshield. Even though this sticker is removed at the dealership and also ""scraped"" off with a razor blade, you can not see the sticker at all, until the sun hits the windshield right.  Then you can see what we are calling a ""ghost sticker"" that looks like a poorly attached cell phone screen protector.  Apparently there is no way to remove this ""residue"" and it will remain there for a long time to come.  Initially I thought it was an informational sticker actually imbedded inside the windshield for some reason until I talked to the dealer about it.    Improve where the center console storage box is located.  Perhaps relocate some sort of storage compartment or slot to the left side of the dash where there seems to be a decent space to put something.  Most vehicles have somewhere to at least rest your cell phone.      Also...my Murano came to my dealership without the subwoofer installed at the factory.  After driving my Murano for a few days, I could tell there was no bass in any of the songs.  Sure enough, no subwoofer was in the space of the spare tire.  When compared to another Murano SL that one had one, mine didn't.  The dealership resolved this issue immediately, but makes me wonder if there was anything else missing."
The ride is amazing.  The overall performance and comfort is to my liking.  All controls are easy to get to and easy to figure out.
I LOVED my Altima which is why I went for another Nissan.  I continue to recommend my Altima over my Murano.
"Better fuel mileage (I know everyone wants better gas mileage).  Need altitude on GPS display (When I drive over mountain passes, I like to know how high I am).  Need better compass on GPS display.  Only one choice for light turn signal (three).  Need more choices of 4, 5, 6.  Need blind spot mirrors on the outside mirrors (standard).  Blind spot lights are a nice feature.  Could use crossing side lines beeper and display.  Cameras are great!  Should have the option to turn on rear camera without having to shift into reverse (so you can see the line when you pull into parking lot through first spot to second spot in front of it)."
"Very comfortable to drive.  Very quiet inside while driving.  Love the cameras.  Love the blind spot lights and beep.  Like how it changes gears, can't even tell it is shifting.  Bose speakers are great.  Love the design and the sleek look of the vehicle.  GPS is good but could use a couple more features (Like inputting the zip code to help locate town).  Love cruise control features."
Best car I have ever owned so far.  Comfortable and great features.
I'm unable to move the back seats backwards and forwards and have lost multiple things in them and I can't move the seat forward to retrieve.  I have a platinum and wish it included lane departure warning like my 2015 rogue sl had on it.
The exterior styling and midnight edition rims. Ventilated seats.
Love the value for the money.
Not perfect
"This is the most comfortable,  quality performance auro I have ever owned.  I love it's performance on the open road and it is so incredibly comfortable."
"Seat comfort, visibility from driver's seat, suspension, road ability and steering."
"It is the most comfortable,  smootest ride I have ever had in this price range."
Add auto start from inside hpuse
The feel and comfort of driving.  Safe gasoline
Its awesome
Better service
It handles very well
Great vehicle and priced right
"We can not think of any way to improve on our new Murano, we are very happy with it."
Ease of handling and comfort.
We have had several Nissan vehicles over the last 30 years and we have had outstanding experiences with the cars and the service.
Nothing
The comfortable seats
Because I am very happy with my car
Apple air play
It is a good car for driving
better fit/installation of plastic kick/rocker panels and weather stripping attachments
overall styling interior and exterior and overall performance.  It really seems to be a good car. with minor problems/adjustments
overall this seems to be a really good car for the reasons previously stated
Like performance and ride
Nothing - I love the car - and was not willing to pay for the platinum edition which would have probably increased all my ratings to the highest possible.
The interior style and design
I've been driving a Nissan for 15+ years - I absolutely love the brand.
Install wiring prior to the installation of the carpeting.
Appearance and ammenities
"Depends on what the other party is looking for. If it were luxury or ride quality, I would be less likely to recommend the vehicle."
Very happy with the vehicle
The vents in the front do not emit as much air as my pathfinder so you have to adjust them constantly
"Everything!  The panoramic sunroof, the seats mold to your body, the computer technology, the interior design with the trim is gorgeous(that sold the car), push start, I love this car!!"
We've owned 4 Nissans and the dealership in Bourne Ma is exceptional.
Nothing. I love it.
The driver's seat is the most comfortable I've been in.
Great cars for a reasonable price.
"The only thing I have noticed, and it is minor, is the door handle operation.  It works perfectly fine, but it feels less...something...luxurious?...than a luxury vehicle when opening the door."
"Comfort, and level of luxury.  I'm built for comfort, not speed.  This is a very comfortable car."
Very happy with the product.  I have already recommended it.
"Add lane departure warning,  make ventilated seats COOLED like other cars."
"Styling, cargo flexibility."
Love them.
Looks and room
good dealership response and good quality
The car was not detailed well when I picked it up there are pices of plastic wrapping still sticking out of the interior doors that I can't get rid of
The pick up and go and spaciousness of the interior
The Murano is so versatile
If the gas mileage was a bit better.  There is a reflection on the beveled piece of the hood by the windshield that can be distracting especially at night.  My old murano had an automatic windshield wiper function and I miss that.
Love CarPlay!!
I have been very happy with my 2014 and my 2017'muranos   The first one held up well. I intended to purchase it at the end of the lease and I only leased a newer one because it had CarPlay .
handling for an suv is great
10th nissan vehicle in a row so .....
Organizational compartment in back similar to rogue
Design
I drive all the luxury SUVs.  Murano is far superior
"Drives very differently than 2014 Murano - lumbering, no pickup, drives like a truck.  Entirely unacceptable, would not have purchase car, unfortunately, test drive was not enough, made mistake assuming there was not a complete change in driving dynamics.  Very dissatisfied."
Said it all in prior note.  Stuck with car for duration of lease.
"Please read prior comment. Drives like a heavy truck.  I was very happy with my prior, 2014 Murano."
Dashboard reflects on to driver and passenger front windows.  Better front of vehicle visability
Solid quiet ride.
Good value
"The door pockets in the front are to small and shallow. I have had 5 Murano's and they have gotten smaller each year. The cargo space in the back has gotten a bit narrower, and the lift gate in the back, you really need to pull on it to initially lift it."
"great gas mileage, new body design, and interior design, comfortable ride and handling, safety"
"I am loyal to Nissan, I have had 7 Nissan vehicles,  5 have been Murano. The cars are reliable, safe, stylish, great ride/comfortable"
Nice Car. Delivery process was too hurried. Pressed me to take the car that evening.
"Comfort, space, overall near luxury ambiance and appearance of the car."
"Dealer sales and delivery experience was less than perfect, shall we say."
storage up front is limited and I would say a lot of potential space is wasted.  Small compartment where USB port 1 is located is not useful
Interior is very nice. Exterior is also attractive.  Handling is secure.
Having owned a highlander I think the murano has fewer features than that car. For instance hill assist and snow modes for driving.  Front storage is better on highlander.
"I would like the sun visors to have the extenders that my old Altima had--they were very helpful.  Also, just better gas mileage"
"Love the look, comfort of the seats, roominess.  Just really love the vehicle except for the visors"
"Sales man was stellar in his presentation, explanation and knowledge.  I felt that he was working on my behalf, which to me signifies great training and keen insight.  Also, the vehicles are wonderful!"
"this was an expensive vehicle and there are small things missing..rain sensor wipers, a better, more reliable navigation.  Also there are visibility issues"
the comfort of the seats and the ride.  the storage
Because I'm not completely satisfied for the high price of the car!
"It's looks, it's drive, it's comfort, it's roominess, it's mileage for the size vehicle"
I love everything about it
I love everything
All design and light Cashmire beige color of my car and all futures.!!!
Because I am happy with my murano
A few minor issues as indicated - but car is well designed.  CVT transmission causes some acceleration.
"Quiet and nice ride, comfortable and roomy.  Well designed interior and exterior."
"Quality of the vehicle was great, but a bad sales experience and lack of follow through with Nissan corporate has left me skeptical of recommending the brand."
The look of the interior
"We have leased/purchased Nissan vehicles for about 15 years now and we are always content with the sales dept.  We tell everyone how easy to do business, and what a great team you have."
"On occasion, the Carplay glitches and NissanConnect has to restart."
Everything!
"I have 19 points required to proceed in purchasing a vehicle. This Nissan Murano hits all of them, with no exception."
needs a better quick use tech guide
Everything !!
So far it has been a joy to own
nothing can be improved the vehicle is outstanding.
The handling is very sporty. The interior and exterior look more aggressive and attractive. It drives like a European sports car.
Nissan offers exceptional service and quality.
Steering Wheel is uncomfortable
Safety features
Enjoying my vehicle because its new but they are somethings that I am not happy about
"Very comfortable and smooth riding. Sharp looking,    Front cameras are great."
I really like my car.
"took vehicle in to point out paint blemishes, was given appointment of June 26th, almost 2 months to get car in...not impressed."
"Everything, saw it at Auto Show, within first 5 minutes of arrival, compared to Hundyi Tuson Sport, Grand Cherokee, Masda CX9...you win."
Just great Vehicle
automatic seat re-set
handles very well  nice acceleration
service overall quality of car
The minor things I have already noted in the survey could be addressed and then it would be a perfect experience.
"The look, feel, and ease of the vehicle"
Just because of the flaws I have mentioned in the survey
Overall great quality and dependability. Gas mileage was far below what what was expected and the irregular configuration of the cargo area limits the utility of the space.
More storage would be a plus
Peformance
"This is my first experience with a Nissan, so I have yet to see how reliable the vehicle will be long-term"
"Comfort, acceleration, roominess"
"I don't know enough about the brand overall, can only speak to my Murano"
No improvements needed. This is the best vehicle I have ever owned!
"Appearance, quality of the ride, quiet, large trunk, spacious interior, technology is cutting edge, sound system, navigation system, keyless entry"
The quality of the vehicle is exceptional! I will continue to buy Nissan. I had a Porsche SUV owner staring at my car. I think he had buyer's remorse.
Im not really in love with the way the phone system works by having to keep pressing buttons to go to the next step...seems like a long process compared to my audi. cup holder in console could be improved ...it would be better if you could cool it down to more than just 60 inside the car.  Over all I really like the vehicle just minor things I would change.
stability in winter driving and I like the new design of the murano.....with it had more interior color options to choose from though.
great vehicle overall and I love how it handles in the winter (buffalo NY) I also had a great experience with West Herr in Buffalo....I would recommend them to anyone looking for a car!
I like walking up to it and thinking wow thats a really sharp looking vehicle and its mine!
One of the best looking and so many bells and whistles in a vehicle for the money. I had a Toyota 4-runner that I drove for 11 years before my purchase of My Murano!!
overall value of the car.  Fair price for a great car.
Although I've only had the car a short time is runs and looks great.
Absolutely nothing.
"Best vehicle I've ever owned, hands down!"
"Only 500 miles on car. Still getting use to heating/air condition controls, the use of hands free and the visibility. Husband says seats not quite wide enough due to rise on sides of seat."
"Love the look of the vehicle inside and out. The width of console.  Quietness,  having hands free and large backup screen."
Very happy with car so far.
"Nothing, I am in love with my first SUV."
"Everything about exterior body style, lines, chrome, and headlights/tail lights. Its a sporty but very classy attractive car."
I'm very impressed by the quality and options of my murano for the price compared to other similar SUVs.
Design
Transmission is not as good as I expected.
Overall I am pleased with my 2017 Murono
I like everything about it but the GPS is great!
This is my 2nd one and I like 'em!
"Two suggestions.  The first suggestion is minor.  It is to make the front doors sound more solid when closing.  The rear doors sound solid solid when closing, the front doors do not.  The second suggestion is to add the ""lane keeping"" feature to the technology package.  I was surprised that it was not included."
"Styling and technology.  I don't think I will ever buy another SUV without the ""all around"" camera system.  It's a must have for us!  I also like the adaptive cruise control."
"We have been very pleased with all features of the car.  In addition, the dealership (Northwoods Nissan) has provided a positive sales experience and good service support."
How it drives
It's a good make of cars
Improve shock system. Able to feel ever6 bump 0n the road. Vehicle is very lightweight. Do not feel comfortable driving in high wind
technology
Feel like there are better cars for the same cost.
Designers and engineers must be aware that not all drivers are six feet tall.
It's handling.
"We have driven Nissans for the last 25-30 years.  Our experience has been highlighted by reliability, enjoyable driving experiences, and stylish appearance."
Nothing really
The exterior and interior color combination.
"I lik Nissan vehicles, this is my 5th Nissan vehicle and I like this one the best."
Be better able to answer this after tomorrow's service visit;  but the engine light is very troubling.  And the loose gas cap light warning seems too touchy as I always tighten to one click............................
"Outside and Inside visual lines are appealing, the tech is good but hard to figure out without reading the manual in DETAIL.  Power, comfort, handling is first class."
"I'll know better after tomorrows maintenance visit, if engine light continues that's a real PROBLEM!"
Absolutely love my new Murano! I think it's beautiful inside and out.
"The appearance, ride and overall handling of the Murano!"
My family has probably purchased 9 or 10 Nissans over the years and have never had a problem. Extremely reliable and attractive to look at. I think Nissan is a leader in innovation with their vehicles.
"I don't have any complaints just yet, the car is running good. The only thing is the gas tank I used more than I was using normally with my old car."
The new technology that is incorporated and beeps every time iam to close to something. The space in the interior.
"Because is a outstanding car, has everything a client can ask for."
"Interior layout, technology, handling"
"Overall package, drives well"
Love the luxurious look and feel
I have purchased my last three vehicles and would highly recommend Nissan and the staff at Harry Green. They are always helpful and quick to respond to any issues.
we are very happy with this vehicle so far.
"luxury feel to interior, exterior and ride"
No problems so far
Have always had good service.
Figure out what is really causing the engine light to come on after fueling.
Design
"Good vehicles, good customer service"
Better fuel economy.
The camera system allows me to see my cats so I don't run over them.  Major reason I bought the car.
Poor fuel economy.
eliminate the cvt transmission. it vastly diminishes the driving pleasure. I feel inept when trying to accelerate during merge situations.  the interior fit could improve.
"materials ,design, technology dash cluster ,controls ,steering brakes,estheticaly beautiful vehicle."
the murano is not fun to drive. it may be dangerous to an inexperienced driver
"I would like the availability to lock in the seat on the drivers side to not slide back when the car is turned off to make it easier to get out , I consider this feature unnecessary and wear on the battery."
"It handles very well, nice smooth ride,very attractive interior and exterior. Lots of compliments came my way on how nice the car was!"
I am very pleased with my purchase so far.
"I'm not terribly satisfied with my purchase.  The front seat has a piece of plastic that sticks out that pokes into my skin on my leg.  The hard shifts that you feel in the transmission is annoying, it doesn't seem to have smooth acceleration at all."
The appearance
I'm not a fan of the way the transmission reacts.  Driver seat comfortability is not conducive to long drives.  Gas mileage is terrible.
Everything
It is the best car we have ever owned.
"Front windshield was defective with water spot between the glass.  Thank you for replacing it at no cost.  However, shame on you all for not seeing the defect in supplier inspection, the final check out at the plant and also at the 2 dealers who handled the car. It involved 2 trips to my dealer which is 50 miles from my home, plus 5 hours of time. I personally thought I should bill you my rate at work for the mess you made.  But if that is the only thing to go wrong, I am really blessed."
The engineering is really superb.
The dealer was the best experience I have had in 55 years of buying cars
No thoughts on improvement
The smooth driving
Because I've dealt with Nissan before and have never had any problems.  Good people to work with.
"Just make sure bumper cover stays on and does not fade, since it had to be repainted. I want my $40,000 dollar vehicle original. I intend to mention at 5000 mile service."
Nice ride and all the extras.
Never had any trouble at all with my previous Toyotas and BMW's
Bluetooth connectivity needs to be improved.  I've read issues in general for other Murano owners on line.
comfortable and stylish.
issues with technology
Like the car
Acceleration at stat
Appearance
I am not thinking that all of Nissan vehicle are good.
"More interior places for glasses, tissues, napkins , straws etc"
Because I like it
More gas mileage
Drive smooth and handle very well
Its is a very good vehicle
"I paid to much for a vehicle that has NO bells or whistles. Manual chair, no leather, no moonroof,etc"
My wife loves it.
I have a toyota 4 runner  and they are night and day in every way.
Only getting 13 .2 mpg on this car
The styling on this model both interior and exterior beautifully designed
Gas usage disappointing
The Bose system is not a good as the previous model I had 2015 Nissan Pathfinder.. Seems they have cut corners on the sound
Seats are excellent Styling is excellent
To time consuming
Blind spots are out of control. Takes a lot of getting used to. Nothing that's noticeable with a test drive.
Very comfortable. Great gas mileage. Classy looking. Handles very good
I've had a few different models in my diving life and have always really felt good in them
"Difficult to hear people on cell phone, volume has to be at a high setting. Doors getting scuff marks easily even when no one is putting their feet on it. Dirties easily."
appearance....sharp looking
I was very happy with the Salesperson at Pembroke Pines Nissan. However the finance people need some work when it comes to their personalities
I also owned a 2016 Nissan Murano.  The 2017 seems a little cheaper in the doors.  They feel more hollow and not quite as sturdy which may be why the windows rattle.
Roominess and style of the interior
It's a nice ride
The look
"I like the looks, rides well and so far seems dependable"
I  wish we would of purchased all wheel drive
Should of been 10
The exterior looks.
Trouble free
Have had 12+ NISSANS
We would like to have the side mirrors com E in autom as tically
comfort
"everything was excellent- service, delivery, car features, ride, comfort, amenities"
The Murano is perfect
Just the fact that I have a new vehicle
I answered a 10 because I love my Murano.  Anyone that purchase one would love it also
I love my Nissan Murano
Everything
Because I don't have nothing bad
N/a
Style
Reliability and style
Because
"I would love to have had more color options for my vehicle's interior/exterior combination.  I very much dislike the 'accent' on the car with the tan interior.  I, therefore, had to go with the dark charcoal/black interior. The height of the front and read windshields in short.  I have to use the visor and when it is down, I can't see everything I need to without ducking.  I have been unable to get any seat/steering wheel combination that allows me any better view.  Additionally, the side window panels with my package are soooo expansive (there are side door speakers where I usually can see out of the car), I feel it is a safety hazard."
"The car exterior design is very attractive.  The following features for the price of the vehicle:  heating steering wheel, cooled/heated seats, power back seat fold and unfold."
My dealership staff are extremely nice.
"Overall, very pleased. I wish it did not roll back when brakes released on an incline"
The comfort of the seats and the look of the vehicle
Overall quality of Nissan product. I feel Nissan uniquely pulls together luxury with sportiness in the Maxima and the Murano
Height from ground. How comfortable and the way it looks inside
Great car!!!!!
x
"technology, ride, attractive interior and exterior"
"style, ride and technology"
I am very pleased with this Murano!!!  I am proud to own and to drive it!
"Handling, power, looks."
"My seventh Nissan/Datsun without a major problem.  The dealership is exceptionally good, with honesty and integrity through out."
Look and feel of Murano; courteous staff (sale and service); dealership proximity to my home.
Gas mileage needs to improve. A plug-in hybrid option would be highly considered.
Power of the engine. Quietness when driving.
It is a good car with many things going for it. You have to be happy driving it.
"The doors not unlocking when the car is put in park only automatically unlock when the car is turned off, otherwise you have to use a button. Hitting the outside door button to lock all doors only works once all doors are closed. Have to wait on people to close their door and stand by the driver door until they close theirs. What's the point of having a push start if you have to have your clicker in your hands to lock the doors. Trunk door doesn't close easily. Always have a light saying it's open. Have to slam it. Fuel tank too small. Gas mileage not that great. Got stuck in a very shallow ditch one morning. Any other SUV I've driven easily gotten out of the front yard ditch after parking there. Just doesn't perform up to the standards I thought it would. Very disappointed. Considering trading back in for another Jeep Grand Cherokee"
Interior is nice
Not happy with the Murano I purchased.
Park assist
technology package
Everything comfortable and really looks great
Already have recommended it
Fix blue tooth so people on the other end of calls can understand us. Would like back seats to be roomier. Would like more storage compartments.
"Everything about the camera, WE LOVE!  That's one of the main reasons we bought a Nissan. Memory seats, WE LOVE!  Thank you so much for these features."
"Because of camera, memory seats, interior comfort, exterior good looks, good relationship with local Nissan dealership in working to meet our needs when a problem arises."
I enjoy all features.
Great value for the car. I have 2 Muranos and enjoy them both.
At this moment I am very satisfied with my Nssan Murano
I like all of it!
Little hiccup upon first arriving to purchase vehicle. Wasn't greeted or helped for a bit.
It drives so smoothly and the ease of use of everything about the car is truly remarkable
I have never driven a nicer car and the people at the dealership were extremely helpful and kind
"I made the wrong decision on this vehicle when I chose the silver/chrome accents on the interior.  When the sun is shining the glare/reflection from the chrome actually hurts my eyes. Maybe it has to do with my age(62)?  [My glasses automatically change to sunglasses but it still hurts.]  Also, although very sharp looking the way the hood of the car is indented right near the windshield also produces glare & hurts my eyes.  It also catches leaves & debris more."
It is GORGEOUS! SMOOTH! SO COMFORTABLE!   My 1st SUV so enjoy being higher.
I owned a Nissan 200sx from 1980-1990 & had no issues.   My car is not even 3 mos old yet but I am looking forward to 10 yrs with my murano.
I would love it if the lane check feature and/or the safety feature where driver is too close to another vehicle was standard.
Reliable vehicle from a reliable company
Would like more of the safe drive features in model without sunroof. I don't use sunroof so didn't want one.
The feel when driving.
Have had Nissan vehicles for 20 years or more and are my favorite cars.
"Driver and passenger seat too short, I traded in my 2016 Maxima platinum and the seats were more comfortable and there were more options on the maxima that I liked than my 2017 Murano. Too much road noise.. Driver and passenger rear view mirrors are hard to see over/blind spot especially on driver side."
Sitting up higher off the road and the roominess. Automatic trunk release.
"Unsure if there would be any issues to have to return to the dealership on a brand new car 3 times, when hadn't even made the first payment. Dealership very friendly!"
Still use my cell phone for navigation.
Appearance and option package.
Price
Very satisfied with vehicle.
"Seats, dash display. The overall comfort."
"This is my third Nissan. I love the price, quality and comfort."
Good Place to put phone in interior
Modern Interior look
So far it's a great car
To many blind spots.
Looks
Blind spots are a problem.
This vehicle is everything i wanted and prefer and that's why it was my choice to purchase it.
The easy of operating this car is superior to most every car I've possessed
"This car is enjoyable to drive, to ride in and superior in appearance."
Gas Mileage & trunk storage not the best
"The warning for drifting into other lanes is not effective.  Based on driver's pattern of driving is not the best way to make this feature useful.  Down loading CD's into the radio HD system would be a good thing.  I miss this feature which was in my previous car, an Acura."
"I like the size, and the appearance of the interior.  The Navigation system is very good."
It is a well featured car for the money.
looks & handling of vehicle
"have had 3 now and no major issues with any of them, dependibility"
New design for middle console to make resting elbow more comfortable.  Better steering wheel controls.
Drives well and looks great
"The seats are pretty comfortable but when sitting in the driver seat, my left leg keeps getting pinched by the plastic on the front of the seat."
It looks like an very expensive vehicle and the ride is smooth.
I like my vehicle. I also love my dealership.
Good vehicle service was nice a little break in communication but not bad
"I absolutely LOVE my new suv! One feature that I wish it had is lane departure notification. I also think that my 2006 Murano had more leg room in it. Other than that, I am completely satisfied!"
I love the smoothness of the ride & the cooling seats!
"Nissan is a very good quality vehicle!  As a matter of fact, my 2006 Nissan Murano is stil being driven. 200,000+ miles strong."
Nothing...I really enjoy the Murano
Styling
The product and Sorg Nissan is an exceptional dealer
Very pleased with the vehicle in general
The technology incorporated into this vehicle
"Vehicle suit my purpose, my suit friends or family members"
Needs tray in front of shifter for stuff!  With no lumbar support added the lower part of the seat back still irritates (pushes) my hips.  Also the cruise cancel button is awkward to reach.  Love the styling!
Exterior styling.
I think you spent all your money on styling and skimpt a bit by using carpet wheel well liners and advertised tha vehicle as tow ready.  1500# towing capacity is hardly ready to tow anything other than a garden tractor on a light trailer.  How about the rest of us?  We could add a heavier hitch but I'm guessing the transmission or the cooling wouldn't take it for an extended trip.
technology
this is the first nissan I have own and have only owned it for 3 months.  I feel it's to early to give a 10 overall.
better sound system
"smoothness or ride, appearance, and power. overall, better than the Cadillac CTS i previously drove."
quality product with the latest technology and follow up customer service.
"This is our 3rd Nissan.  We traded in a 2014 Rogue, which we were not impressed with at all.  The Murano is exactly the quality we expected from Nissan.  We drove our Altima for 9 years, 240K miles, no repairs other than expected maintenance.  Interior still looked new.  The Murano is a beautiful vehicle, we expect to drive it for at least 10 years."
"The interior, it is very classy.  We have the tan leather with mother of pearl trim."
"Although Nissan missed the mark with the Rouge, our Altima and the Murano were/are exceptional vehicles.  Our salesperson, Paul Jones is professional and builds relationships with his customers.  We never felt like he was selling us a car.  He was the salesman for all of our Nissan purchases.  Hope he never leaves Nissan."
Sound system isn't as good as what I had with my 2013 Pathfinder.
"Simply, the look, both inside and out."
"I had issues with the transmission on my 2013 Pathfinder, and they could never solve that issue for me.  I'm a little leary, wondering if I'll encounter the same issues with the Murano."
Not a thing at this point
Body and interior design
Good quality built vehicle
"I love how this SUV looks, drives and handles. My only complaint is the extreme level of cabin noise starting at speeds of about 40-45 mph."
"Everything except for cabin noise. Our salesman was very patient and  knowledgeable and did a wonderful job answering our questions and showing us how to use all this technology. We would buy a new vehicle from him again, but not a Murano. There must be a design flaw in this model."
Please see my comments about cabin noise
The interior is beautiful! Everyone comments on it!
I love the car and received excellent attention when purchasing it.
The interior and the excelleration
It is a very comfortable car and it handles well
Great car for the value
just the seat adjustment for short people
I can see over the side mirrors when turning a corner. Of course this is sitting on a pillow.  In our Pathfinder the side mirrors were so large and where they were paced was dangerous for me.  I had to stretch up to see if road was clear and almost pulled out in front of a vehicle twice before I realized I had a dead spot.
"We like the styling, roominess, reliability, 30 mpg, easy to drive."
Turning radius could be much better.
The seats!!!!!
It's beautiful and so comfortable.
Technology and the ride are the top items.
Really overall please with the Murano
"Change the design of the front seats away from the bucket style and make flat..Make more space between the door and seat controls to get hand down there. Correct where the wrap around bumper meets the body of the car on the rear right side, makes it feel like shoddy workmanship."
"The color of the interior is very pretty. champagne color and I like the double moonroof. I don't like the black wheels, silver colored wheel rims would tie in much better with the silver trim on the car."
Because of the issues previously mentioned. To me they are design flaws. Overall it is a very nice car but not perfect for me from a comfort standpoint especially.
Video tutorial would be helpful
"Gorgeous, luxury car. Comfortable"
Fantastic features
Nothing so far. I have been in a loaner vehicle since day 3 of my purchase
The car has been with the dealer since Day 3 of my purchase. It has been over 2.5 months since my car was dropped off.     Nissan has just now started to discuss my vehicle buy back as an option and seems to have no roadmap as to when i can have my car or a new car.
the front seats can be a bit wider.
appearance
I really like the vehicle
"We love our new vehicle. We couldn't be happier with it unless it got better gas mileage. However, considering the size of the murano the gas mileage is very good."
The quietness and the comfortable ride.
The vehicle is well designed and the people we worked with at Nissan Lupient were wonderful to work with.
I was very disappointed when I purchased new car (not cheap car) I did not get the floor mats with the car- I had to purchase them.  I am not talking about rubber mats just the plan mats that I thought always came with a new car - and have with the other vehicles I have bought -
I guess I just like it -  I better I purchased it ---
I think people should make up their own mind as to the car they buy -
"As stated earlier, change design of armrest storage and add slide extender to visor."
"The ride, the  roominess, the luxury look."
"Fits my overall needs as to looks, ride, mileage & love Miller Auto service."
"Nothing, I love my Murano!"
I love the quality for the price.
I've loved my Nissan more than any other car I've ever owned.
They took excellent care of me.
Everything! No complaints
"I personally like the Nissan vehicle's, never had issues, always been taking care of. Good people to work with, been respected!"
Carpet fixed and scratches fixed.
It's cooling
N/A
Very nice car
Technology
Reliable
None it's amazing
"Everything, the heated seats and heated steering wheel are always my favorite living in Chicago and the panaromic sunroof is a neat accessory giving more of a view for my daughter in the back seat."
Quality customer service and very professional all around.
I feel ripped off by my sales guy paying way to much for a lease and didn't get a good deal on my trade in it was a 2014 rouge which I bought from them and it only had 17000 miles on it and they gave me fair price for it ! Which was only 12000 and then I saw it on the lot for 18895 and I didn't get any cash back it went towards the lease ! I feel stupid thinking they would take good care of me at MaLady Nissan since I was a good customer but I can't even enjoy my new car cause I feel so cheated and stupid !
The ride
I guess it's not Nissan fault just the dealership MaLady in crystal lake il
"My  only complaint is there are some blind spots due to the windows being pretty small in the back of the vehicle. I'm getting used to it, and I'm just extra careful."
"I love how smooth the radius, the overall look of the car is absolutely beautiful. I also love the spacious storage in the back of the vehicle, when I put the seats down it's really big & can accommodate a lot!  I also feel the need to mention how wonderful my experience was with Ed Schmitt at Naperville Nissan dealership, he was extremely professional and we got through a pretty long process in a fair amount of time.  I would definitely go back to him for future purchases."
"It started with my conversation with Ed Schmitt at Naperville Nissan, he knew specifically that I wanted a black 2017 SV Nissan Murano. He located one in  Wisconsin and had someone drive it to the Naperville location. To me, that is going above and beyond. This was the third Nissan dealership that I had looked at and no one else offered to look outside their lots.  The entire process from start to finish was just a pleasant one."
"At this time, don't really know."
Had 2015 Murano--repaired for same problem about 12 times in 2 yrs.--oxygen sensor was the problem. Nissan replaced 2015 with 2017 under lemon law. Now the battery dies after only 700 miles in 2017. Why would I recommend it to anyone?
it a top of the line
I would really appreciate more storage capacity in the car.  My power seats consume most of the room under the seat preventing me from putting items there.  The only real room is in the rear of the vehicle.  I would recommend adding storage in the rear floorboards.
The ride is very smooth and comfortable to travel long distances.  We recently took a 13 hour trip and the seats were super comfy.  I own the platinum model and appreciate all of the upgrades it has to offer.
"I think it's a great luxury vehicle for the cost.  My friend has an SUV made by Chevy and paid almost what I did.  Comparing the two, I feel mine has higher quality features."
Looks
Other makes and models in the same ballpark for the price
better fuel milage
good dealerdhip
Do not like a this feature of navigation system. When entering freeway does NOT indicate next few exits automatically unless destination is engaged. My other Lexus does and I miss this feature very much.  Cannot get this feature on rhis navigation system and was told it existed but it does not.  Very disappointed. Sales person Amanda tried on several occasions to correct this but apparently does not exist.
Safety features.  Cameras showing all areas of car when parking and reversing.  Light and buzzer indicating vehicles in blind spots
Navigation system does not meet my expirations. Explained already freeway entrance.  On three occasions I used it to locate unfamiliar place   Told me I had arrived at destination which was a strip mall but I needed to go not there but an additional three houses past mall.  Tells me I have arrived but I need to go farther than voice tells me.
I love my Murano.no problems so far.lots of compliments.
Easy to drive
"So far, it has been a reliable vehicle"
Not yet sold on the CVT technology. Seems to rob engine performance. I was expecting more pep considering the engine size.
"Appearance, comfort, technology and it's fun to drive."
The features that attracted me is a matter of preference. I haven't owned the vehicle long enough yet to have an opinion on reliability.
"Design, inside and out"
I would have worked to improve the overall gas mileage of the vehicle.
I do like many of the safety features of the vehicle. I also like the surroundsound offered in the vehicle.
Overall it's an excellent vehicle. With many of the safety features that would help in contacting my family.
Fix tailgate warning.
"Beautiful interior, ""boomerang"" tail lights. Smooth ride."
Overall happy. Tail gate hatch kept it from a 10. Not happy I can't stop with my foot on the brake and my passenger cannnot get out without me putting it in park first.
Put a quality audio system in it that's not underpowered......get it together on audio connectivity with devices......have more usb ports
Styling
"I've owned Cadillacs, Buicks, Infiniti Honda....the audio system is sub par and the device connectivity is too limited"
I have had no problems with my Murano and so far I am very pleased with its performance the delivery of the sales of it everything thank you
The amount of room it has. The way it handles itself. Attractive.
It was such a smooth purchase. All my questions were answered. Presentation perfect. Salesman Richard listened to my needs and wants. And he delivered.
I feel like it's a great vehicle great looks and so far has been fun to drive
Seat belt design in sloppy from the inside. People in back seat can step on front seat belts as they are coming from the floor board.
Overall package is very attractive. Awesome interior and ride. Drove 700 miles to Tennessee. Had a fabulous drive.
6th Nissan owned.
Well one thing is that you don't have the sensors to stop the hatch from closing if a child would happen to get in the way. Not a good family vehicle for safety.
I love the way it handles and the navigation system. I enjoy driving it. Just like I said if it wouldn't be for the few things I pointed out I would it at a 100%.
It has only a few little flaws but overall it awesome!
its new
"this is my 4th nissan   1.b210 over 400,000 miles  2sx240 368000 still running  3. 03 350z  322000  traded in,wish i had it back"
Love it
Everything
Because it is great
Appearance and style
This is the third Nissan vehicle we have owned and have been completely satisfied with all three
"The vehicle seems to be o,k. Right now but Nissan needs to revamp the service departments especially for the price we the consumers are paying for your product.. Also I was told that the 3 year 36000 warranty doesn't cover the navigation but for only 12 months 12000 miles. IS THIS TRUE????"
My wife loves everything about it other than the service we received for s dirty sun roof cover that what like that when we bought it brand new that Sparks Nissan said they would take care of. They had our car for nearly 3 weeks and have us s dirty Altima to drive. A 29000 thousand vehicle instead of a 39000 thousand vehicle we paid for!!!
I don't know if I would recommend Nissan have not had it long enough yet to know
Passenger seat won't raise up are down and driver seat don't have memory of first and second driver.district
Love car
Good vechicles
climate control temperature setting depends if sunny or cloudy can not set at only one temperature for all weather conditions
fuel mileage
maybe they have a strong position on another make
Quality and style
"I previously had a Nissan Pathfinder that had over 200,000 miles on it when I traded for this new Murano.  I expect the same quality with this Murano."
Our 2nd Nissan...we are fans...love the vehicles we have had and want our friends to know it.
Roominess. Adaptive cruise control. Sleek design inside.
This is my second Nissan. Never had any issues. Purchased a Nissan for my daughter and she has never had any problems and loves the features.
I didn't have the best experience with the Financing department and follow ups
"Been great so far.  I still have many things to learn about the features to fully take advantage of all of them, but I will get there eventually!"
Sporty look and sturdy feel.
This is my second Nissan and I had a very good experience with the first one and now this one so far.
"The radio could stay on when the engine is turned off, until the door is open.  The Rogue does this."
The style and size of the interior
Very good dealer experience and there is a wide range of vehicles.
fix the body issues that was reported to the dealership
Right now nothing wish I didn't purchase the car due to the body issues
Need the body issues taken care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Quality, tech & interior appointments"
Comfort
"Have had Nissans in past, no problems"
Nothing.
"Color, looks"
"The way it look, drive and how roomy it is inside.  Also the instrument panels are everything I need   In a suv."
I can't think of anything
"So far, everything"
I am very please with the vehicle
Driver seat not as comfortable as passenger seat. seat belts hard to access on entry. Interior noise level could be reduced - willing to pay extra for quiet rides. Going over bumps is harder than expected.
Excellent handling and steering. Well designed safety and user features (poor documentation however). Excellent acceleration in traffic. Warning systems for accident avoidance excellent
Good vehicle but would identify my concerns as noted.
The GPS system could be more friendly. When I need to add a new location I can't type in the space that allows you to do that.
"The comfort and the way it handles on the road. For an added bonus I get to know when someone is too close to me. With so many drivers texting and driving, you have to be on the outlook for them leaving their lanes all the time."
I believe it is a good car.
Nothing I am very happy with my vehicle
"The ride, comfort, fuel economy and curb appeal"
Nissan has a good name in the marketplace and from my personal experience I can vouch for this hence I would recommend without any reservations
include a place to hold key like the older muranos.
size and agility.
It's not perfect.
"i would like to have a button that would open the trunk of the car, but if it was a feature that costed extra money then it is fine and opening manually is fine."
i just like the overall driving of the vehicle as it is very smooth both accelerating and breaking and the overall drive is smooth.
it is a great car overall.
The back seats are uncomfortable. The graphite interior shows every fingerprint.
The Murano drives very well. The look of the car is sleek and modern. The large sun roof and Bose sound system really enhances the driving experience.
Good quality for good value.
this is my third Murano and all three have had the same issue with the radio....  the screen goes dark periodically.
"Comfort, appearance.gas mileage"
The fact that's is my third one should be enough of an explanation as to why I would recommend it.
"There is a piece of plastic at the bottom of the driver's seat (corner near door) that could easily pull away/break off if caught on slacks and one is not careful. Ironically, I have seen this happen on our BMW."
"rear cameras for backing into garage; safety lights/sounds when changing lanes and approaching cars too quickly; comfortable, ergonomic seats"
good value for the features and functions you receive
"No changes can be made at this point, so far as we  know."
"size, color, handling"
better than several other vehicles
"I think some additional safety features should be included like an auditory warning when the speed limit is being exceeded, an audible warning when the vehicle moves out of the driving lane, and automatic braking to avoid collision when the car ahead suddenly stops, larger side mirrors, and better rear visibility."
"I like the interior comfort and spaciousness, the cameras that allow for good visibility, especially when parking.  The GPS system provides clear instruction while driving to unknown locations."
"The vehicle is comfortable and provides many safety devices, but the addition of the ones noted in this review would make it an even better vehicle."
I like it's reliability
I love it but the price may be too much for my friends who are my age.
I love this vehicle- minus the scuff. I plan to address the issue again at first oil change.
Reliability and exterior styling.
This is our second Nissan- my husband has a Juke. We are both happy with our vehicles.
"I only have 2000 miles on the car, will need more time. This was the only Nissan model we were interested in for our needs."
not as quite inside as some other cars. need a different design of glove box.
"color, ride, interior appearance."
really like the cars especially the interior quality. good mileage .
More stability in the rear suspension when loaded with 100-150 LBS of cargo.
"Attention to details and conveniences.  Solved a lot of my complaints about previous vehicles, like the hood not having to propped up and the instrument panel not having a knob protruding  to let dirt in."
"Aside from the price, Nissan vehicles are what they are marketed to be, both trucks and cars.  Our family has owned several, and the only one that had any problems was a new (2016) Pathfinder, and they were all electronic."
"Doors are light as compared to last vehicle a Cadillac  SRX. SOUNDS like tin when closing.  Console in. Enter does not have adequate range of opening to easily access contents. Instrument panel with ""black glass"" is a dust collecting nightmare. Surface of interior door panels attract and SHOW body oils very easily. Braking seems to be of lesser quality I am accustomed to experiencing in my previous vehicle."
Lane alert the best. Seats comfortable.
I own it want others to know I made a good choice.
I don't like that different vehicle models have different options on the touch screen. I listen to internet radio all the time and I don't like that I have to use my phone as the radio with Bluetooth.
Cooled seats
The apps just aren't up to everyone else.
I think that all Nissan's and vehicles in general should come with blind spot monitoring and back up monitor as standard equipment.
Feels big and safe.
Nissan seems to be a good quality vehicle and most of them are nice looking and very comfortable!
Interior
"Roomy, comfortable, stylish"
"I love this car. The fuel economy isn't the best, but that's not why I bought it."
"I love how it looks, and its comfortable to drive. Really like the blue spot warning system."
Love the vehicle and the dealership was terrific. People listened and gave us what we asked for.
I'm not sure.
how it handles on the road.  The comfort of the seats.  The room we have.
"Because it is a great car.  Although, I would not recommend where I purchased it.  They sold us the car for a higher price than we agreed upon.  Not a happy camper!"
"I love it, I call it my little space ship. Love it not sure what to say, enjoy driving it  and expect to be taking small trips soon, through out this wonderful country of ours. But don't have a GPS System. How do I have one installed in my beautiful  little space ship."
over all love my (again) space ship.
"what do you expect me to put down? There are better car out there, I let people chose there liking."
more horsepower
"Paint is too thin. Plastic on bottom driver seat sticks out too much, rubs against my leg."
"Look, maneuverability, smooth drive, spacious"
This is the first time owning a Nissan. Too early to tell
I love it
comfort
vehicle is outstanding
I love it.  So comfortable.   Very smooth. Fast If i need it to be.  Really great.
Sleek  looking.   Very comfortable.   Love the Mocha interior.
Great car.  Dealer was wonderful to work with.
Best at its class!
"Nissan needs to put back the safety features it removed and continue to add some.  An example is that Nissan removed the lane departure feature, doesn't have sensors to detect stationary objects in the front.  Nissan is going backwards in safety while other car makers are going forward."
The ride and the interior.
Not enough safety features.
"interior space, looks."
reliable
Add a few more horse power. Seems to lag a bit when compared to my older Murano.
Appearance both interior and exterior.
"Have had 3 Muranos 3 maximas, a rogue, Altima and a Sentra and aside from recalls, never (knock on wood) had any issues with any of them.  Very reliable in my opinion."
- Vehicle is as expected
"Sound system, great gas mileage"
- Great service
To fix the seat belt sensor would be enough for me
How quite and soft it feels in the highway
Because i feel that for the price i expected the vehicle at least to come with everything working properly
Improve the quality of the paint job.  Fit of the exhaust was poor.
Style.  Power.  Gas milage.
"Historically, I've always driven Honda automobiles.  I find the fit and finish of the Nissan Murano to be poor in comparison to Honda vehicles.  I do like the style of the Nissan Murano though.  Much better styling than Honda and that's why I bought the Nissan Murano."
I love everything about this car except that the phone keeps disconnecting
Looks and rides like a dream
It's my  second one and loved  both
Love Muranos - can't think of any improvements you haven't already incorporated in the Platinum edition!
Appearance and comfort
On my 3rd Murano - have had great experiences with the car and the dealership!
not a lot --- I knew going in the mileage would not be as good as my last last two Altimas
just the new car feeling
happy about the car and the service  received at the dealer
better gas milage would be good
"interior size, seat comfort, wish i had gotten collision avoidance"
good size between full size and smaller suv
nothing
reliability
because I love my Murano
Correct the problem at no cost to me.
interior
"If Nissan is unable to correct this problem, I'm not sure if I will recommend Nissan to anyone."
It is nice
Driver's seat is not as comfortable as I would like. It almost feels like the back support is not even on the left and right sides.  The bumpers scuff very easily. Someone must have grazed my bumper at a parking lot and the scuffs are very apparent.
Beautiful exterior lines. Luxurious interior. I love the overall look of the car.
Because some individual features might be better in other cars.
This is my fifth Nissan I obviously enjoy the product and think it's an excellent  car for the price
"The Murano is a very well put together automobile, My wife owns a Lexus and I actually like the Murano better especially for the price difference"
"Again, very smooth ride, very rich looking interior and exterior. Nissan keeps up with the latest in technology. And knock on wood I have never had a serious issue with any of the cars I have owned"
Always love the quality of my Nissans
sporty design and comfortable seats
excellent car
all everything look good expected no heat seats driver and passenger ... Mine is SV should have heat in seats  Dang ...
GOOD Driving and safety but no blind spot .... Mine is SV
I feel trust Murano
This is THE 2nd  Murano I've owned.  Best performance ever.
Sound quiet ride--comfortable seats
Compass reading could b e made easier to read.
"The size, power, and attractiveness"
Not perfection but close
"Sound system,is nice...Wish it had a little more Bass book.."
Styling??
Great quality
The radio is lacking when using the FM source. Does not pick up stations well at all.
It's new.
I would tell them to shop more than I did.
Options
Good value
More interior cubby holes
"Extremely quiet, smooth performance"
outstanding quality
"Nothing...very pleased with it.  We are first time Nissan owners, so very hopeful that this was the right vehicle for us."
The transmission the way it works.  It doesn't get bogged down.
The Murano has impressed us for the 3 months we have had it.
The features inside the vehicle and exterior appearance.
The Finance process at the dealership was absolutely terrible.  The Finance Manager was one of the sleaziest people I have ever met.  He participates in unclear and fraudulent customer practices.  He lied to us and implied we had no options.  Absolutely unprofessional.
"Great looks, feel and quality"
Faster acceleration at take off would be great.
I love the way my truck drives.
Excellent vehicle
"Fix the the home link problem very annoying I've told several of our friends who have expressed interest in the Murano ""DO NOT USE HOME LINK"". Also the sharp plastic that cuts into your calf."
"Looks, comfort, ride and handling."
Good car
"Side mirrors should fold automatically   Passenger seat should raise or lower automatically & manually.  Inside door ""pockets"" should be able to fold open."
Quietness & ride plus appearance.
Q  Quietness & appearance of quality.
It's the nicest car we have owned.Very happy with this purchase.
I am very satisfied with my Nissan experience.The staff was very professional and helpful.The dealership was very comfortable and I can't say enough about the Murano.
Add more storage space in the front.   A line crossing warning needed.   Automatic hi beams needed.
It looks very good.
It still needs some improvement particularly sound control and smoother ride.
i do not recommend nissan murano for higth comsuption
Love the vehicle!  Right now I can think of nothing to improve how I feel.
I love the way it handles and drives   Seat are very comfortable.  Plenty of room in back seat.
It is the perfect size--bigger than the smaller suv's yet not as big as the Pathfinder.
My camera screen is hard to see in the daytime because of the sun. Also I hear a lot of wind noise.
I would not want another one.
The exterior design
Overall I am pretty satisfy with my Murano's performance.
Very nice riding car. Alot of extras.
Very sleek and rides very smooth.
A very nice  car nice ride affordable.
"More power in the engine, Navigation and phone equipment should not be having the issues I am having. The sound system is fair at best. I am able to make direct comparisons to the 2014 Murano same model  that we owned. If I had to do it again, I would have kept the 2014 which  had none of the issues I am dealing with in the 2017 model. We should not be going backwards!!"
"I like the body style, and the expanded backup camera capabilities most."
"I answered a 2 because I feel that the 2017 model was not even close to my 2014 Murano overall. I bought the 2017 Murano because I felt that new technology would be an added addition to the 2014 that I had. The only problem is that Nissan didn't add the technology to the 2014. They recreated the car but, with standards for below that of its predecessor."
Comfortable and easy to drive
I have enjoyed my car
"In my opinion, this car is wonderful. No need to improve on anything. I love this car"
"I love how the car looks from the exterior..it reminds me of a shark- smooth, sleek, sporty"
These cars last forever
Nothing
I like nissans
"The Murano has 700 miles on it of this date.  We are a Nisan Family with a 2016 Titan and the new Murano.  We owned a 2007 Murano with 74,000 miles that we gave to our son and he loves it.  The new Murano is much better overall then the 2011Toyota Highlander we owned and traded at the Nisan Dealership."
"Still evaluating, but overall smooth ride and quiet interior.  Excellent quality, but with less than 1000 miles on the vehicle we will need more time to determine if it is the best vehicle we have owned.  As a Nissan Family with a Titan and Murano, at this time, we are happy with our purchases."
"Outstanding 2007 Murano we owned since new with 74,000 miles and now my son owns it.  However, the new 2017 Murano seems even to be a better vehicle.  Less than 1000 miles as of this date, overall assessment to be determined.  We certainly hope it continues to be the best Murano we have owned."
Exceptional vehicle and more importantly a terrific staff!  Service after the sale always goes the distance for me.  You team here is incredible.  They get the meaning and value of customer service!
Great product!  More importantly would recommend Oakridge Nissan!!!
Love it
Color and comfort
This is our 5 Nissan. We have had great service
The door noise could be resolved. I have taken it to a dealer who has stated it was two different problems that they felt had fixed the problem but it continued after I left. I am not taking it back because it has become an inconvenience with no resolution.
I LOVE the Nissan Murano- this is my second one. I like everything about the product itself. I still say it's the best vehicle I have owned so far. I am discouraged about the door noise issue but I still love this vehicle.
It has been an outstanding product that last. I have purchased three Nissan's in the last 12 1/2 years. No issues with any of them. I still own two of them.
Quiet ride
Quality car and ease of purchase
Navigation system and comfort driving long distances
Quality of Service
Car is not perfect
the ride and quiet interior.
nobody is perfect
Nothing at this time.
The overall appearance and comfort of driving it.
The quality is very high.
Can't think of a thing.  Extremely satisfied overall.
Everything
The quality of Nissan far exceeds my expectations.
Great car
could have better gas mileage.
overall handling
It is a quality product
Passengers in the back seat complain about air flow
The exterior appearance
Back seat airflow and small rear window
Happy as is.
Electronic package.
This is my 4 th Murano.
Cameras all around vehicle
Just st like the features
I don't like having to plug in my phone to use the connect apps.
I love how smoothly and quietly it drives.
I love so many of the features and I feel completely safe when I drive it.
a little concern the ease of turning car off and car not in park
very happy with car
The up and down volume buttons on the steering wheel could be a lot better
Everything
I love it
Exterior look
This is my second Nissan vehicle and I am very satisfied with quality and reliability of this brand.
Na
Very roomy and comfortable to drive.  Responds to steering and gas pedal good.  V6 has good gas milage and accelerates good.
Haven't had it long enough for a more thorough recommendations.
"Great vehicle, my second and it will be my next"
Looks and technology
Reliable sharp vehicles especially Murano
"Bose sound system. Leather, comfortable driver seat."
Good product.
It's a great auto
It makes my wife happy. She feels much safer because of the safety features(especially the warning lights and beeping when cars are in blind spot)
This is our 3rd one. We really enjoy them
Nothing at this time!! I love it.
Appearance and comfort
No real reason
should be able to fold exterior mirrors electrically  should have lane-departure control  cargo cover should be standard with platinum model
it's a very driver friendly automobile
gut feeling
Fits family needs.
"My option is mine. I would recommend Nissan , but would ""insist"""
I think that i should a purchased the  Murano SV or some other Vehicle.
I an still trying to adjust. This is my first Nissan purchase. I am not sure.
Very pleased with all features of car.
"Body style exterior and interior finish, seating comfort, engine performance, quality of ride."
High quality vehicle competing with luxury cars and at a reasonable price.
"Overall, I'm happy with the vehicle.  A smoother experience with the technology and voice recognition would be helpful.  Not at all sure how google/android apps work with the vehicle"
There's lots to like.
"If asked, I'd provide my thoughts, but I've rarely been asked about a vehicle"
Visibility out backside right of car is poor
"Comfort of seats , apple play, Bose sound system, backup cameras"
Love my new car
Not to start having problems after five years would be great.
Answering phone system
For my granddaughter
The Apple CarPlay sometimes has difficulty connecting. It would be nice if this could connect via Bluetooth. (My husband's Chevy connects Apple CarPlay via Bluetooth). I have missed having a spot for my cell phone between the console and front of the car. I don't like having to keep it in the cup holder and I don't like that I have to keep the small door open for the USB port between the cupholder and console. I would like for that to shut with a USB cord attached.
"Seat coolers, super awesome for the hot Texas summer."
I'm a Murano fan. This is my second one.
"The starter button is in a horrible place.  It needs to be up by the steering wheel not by the gear shift.  We have accidentally pushed it and turned the car off while going down the road.  There was no way to turn it back on.  Very dangerous.  The instruction Manuel needs to be completely redone in a easier to understand format. The cell phone definately needs to be easier to operate and so does the navigation system.  Overall storage is not good.  Side pocket on doors are not deep enough.  Water bottles fall over and small Kleenex packets fall out.  The glove box needs to have an upper compartment with its on access and then the lower compartment.  You also need to be able to enter a destination on the navigation system while the car in in operation so the passenger could put in a restaurant or another destination.  We were not able to do that when traveling, so had to pull over, stop the car then enter a new one.  A huge pain!"
"The drive.  Transmission worked great in the mountains.  Love the styling.  Storage, manual and cell phone easy could definately be improved."
The navigation and cell phone issues are big ones. The amount of storage in the cargo space is small compared to my Toyota Rav.  Not getting as good of gas mileage as we hoped.
Love it!
The roominess and overall drive
Excellent customer service and dependable vehicle
I think the driver' seat should have electric and I would have liked the automatic rearview mirror that I had in the altima.
I like the pick up and the feel of the vehicle.  I feel comfortable in it and safe.
This is my third Nissan.  I enjoy the cars and I would recommend each dealership except Charleston Nissan.
Better gas millage and a roof rack for cargo
"Comfort, warning safety and handling when driving"
It is the best I will rate any thing
"The back seats could be more comfortable for backseat passengers.  The dash has so much info it is difficult for new owners to know where to look for what.  Because of a bad back, My husband would never be able to ride for 400miles at a time without those marvelous front seats. Thank you."
It's hard to pick one thing-- but it would have to be the front seats.  Then the safety features.
Our dealer and salesman were terrific.  I recommended Nissan to my son looking to a pick up.  He bought one and to my brother in law who is going to be talking to his local dealer very soon.
Nothing. Love the new Murano 2017.5
When in cruise control and a car pulls over in front of you the Murano slows down. You can also adjust how far out you want the vehicle to respond. Also LOVE the blind spot indicators.
"Dependable, safety features, good gas mileage, comfortable, roomy"
I am very pleased with the service provided and my vehicle. Thank you.
Its very spacious and very attractive vehicle.
Very pleased with the overall service.
Less road noise. Wider seats front. Fix smelly air conditioner
All safety features
"We have always owned nissans. Recent move down to Vegas, we immediately thought of upgrading our other Murano. I guess we were spoiled by our service in Colorado, because after selling us this new one, we have been less than empressed with the service end of it. We definitely have buyers remorse. Wishing we would have looked around more instead of going back with this nissan"
Panel alignment in interior could be better and more interior color choices would have been nice - we don't like black and gray so our only other choice was white - would have preferred a biscuit color
The seats and styling both inside and outside
"Nobody and nothing is perfect - our salesman, Steve, was great and everyone at the dealership was nice and treated us with great patience and respect"
I love the Murano.  I do wish the passenger had adjustable seats as the driver does as the head room on passenger side is higher.
It is wonderful ride and the seats are so comfortable that you don't want to get out of the car.  I love the safety features and the back up camera compared to my Altima is wonderful.
This is my second Nissan and I have loved both of them.  I would recommend Mossy Nissan as they went over all the options that I was looking at which helped me purchase the Murano.
Nothing Nissan is the best
The comfort of the ride
I like nissans.  They are sharp looking vehicles
Not too keen about the doors being locked and don't unlock when you put the car in park.  Always have to manually unlock to the door to get out.
Comfort and style.
Took quite awhile to negotiate through the process.
"The comfort, beauty and the fact that it isn't an obnoxious, in-your-face ""name"" luxury car.  That is, as my husband would say, a ""sleeper."""
"This is the best and the most comfortable car that I have ever owned.  I was in a financial position to get whatever car I wanted and on the basis of good reviews and a great test drive, we chose the Nissan.  No regrets."
"nothing, I love it"
edgy styling with midnight edition
My last 3 new cars have been Nissan and I have had little to no problems
"Gas mileage on the road is a little bit less then I had hoped for. There could be a little bit more trunk/storage area. Other then that,  I LOVE this vehicle! Exceptional comfort, drive and features."
comfort and how it drives
"The dealership and sales person were very nice and accommodating. This   vehicle drives like a dream, and it just feels like top quality and safety."
super comfortable cabin. Very roomy cargo area. Sexy looking
I'm very happy with my vehicle
More comfortable driver seat.
"Handling, excellent exterior design, iPhone interface, back up camera"
"Excellent experience at dealer, service, and vehicle is exceptional."
Long history with the products and company
Overall nice vehicle
"Wifi enabled, as others cars in this class have. More comfort in back seat, it feels like a bench seat & isn't very comfortable on long drives."
"The exterior look & control panel, very sleek!"
This is my 6th Nissan lease in a row!
I had more interior storage space in my Rogue
Looks and ride
I rarely gice 10
Technology is better than 2015
I like the Nissan this is my 7th Murano and my 12th Nissan. I'm loyal!
"Better service at delivery. not only did we experience issue with the Navigation ""chop"" the car was not as clean as it should be at delivery"
driving it
"Well, I would NOT recommend Legend Nissan to anyone"
I would recommend
"The decorative portions of the interior are pretty, but look plastic. The vehicle performance is great, though."
"It is difficult to choose what I like most. I really like the engine performance, the vehicle security, and the interior comfort features."
Quality
Appearance matched with comfortable ride
Overall great experience
I would like automatic lift hatch
Roomy. Smooth drive. The style and look. Navigation and music . good on gas. I look good in it. Lol
This is my second Nissan and I have found them to be very reliable cars
It's amazing.  Our 3rd Murano.  This is the best
"Styling.  NASA seats.  Exhaust tone. Quality, fit and finish"
"31 years of Nissan experience has been awesome.  Have owned Maximas, Altimas, Sentras, and Muranos----all great vehicles"
Better gas mileage is always a good thing!
Style- both interior and exterior
This is my second one and just love the refinements of a Nissan
"not impressed with the MPG, lack of power folding mirrors or no toneau cover standard on a top of the line platinum."
"Power, fit and finish, look, roominess, ride"
"The value, and the ride and finish of the vehicle is impressive."
"After having to have bumper replaced due to inferior paint, I would have thought Nissan would a least offer a couple of free oil changes. Every Toyota I have bought was offered free oil changes."
Everything
"I think Nissan should offer 2 years of oil changes, just like Toyota does."
N/A
"It's difficult to say what I like most.  I am so in love with my Murano & I can't believe it took me this long to make the switch from Honda.  My Murano is comfortable, reliable and gorgeous."
"I know that my vehicle is reliable and safe, simply because it carries the Nissan name.  The beauty of the vehicle is unmatched and I find myself looking back at it every time I leave it parked."
We purchased the vehicle a few months ago and are extremely happy with it.  Nothing negative to say....
"Comfortable, good power, higher seating gives good visibility, great sound system, unexpected great gas mileage"
I had an Altima prior to the Murano and it's reliability was impressive
"We had a 2009 Murano SL with the Bose stereo system in it. Absolutely stunning sound,  much better than the Bose stereo in my 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 crew cab.  Our new 2017 Murano platinum has the Bose stereo in it as well. Not even close to the sound, volume, and richness of the Bose in our 2009 Murano.  When you load the rear end up with luggage, the bass  pretty much disappears. My 2014 GMC Bose sounds better to me than the one in our 2017 Murano. This is probably the most disappointing difference between our 2009 and our 2017  Murano's."
The headlights are very good! The interior tan leather  is awesome. The interior layout is very nice.
"I think it is the best, most reliable vehicle in its class on the market today at its price point."
"Nothing, I love this car"
Everything
I like Nissans
While I really find this car exceptional the 1 thing I miss from my previous car is the HDD system that would keep recordings of CDs played so they could be replayed without having to carry discs.
the seats and the overall ride.
"I find the car an exceptional value for the money. People are impressed with the interior design, the comfort of the seats and I find the gas mileage a plus."
Transmission is a little sluggish on initial acceleration.
Comfort and safety.
"Excellent value, i.e. great features, and comfort at a fair price."
"I have only driven this vehicle 1500 miles. This vehicle drives great (AWD) as expect the ride is a little on the firm side because of the AWD. There are only a few issues that I would comment on: the console area is very tight with space. If I have a USB cord plugged in and an additional cord for phone the cords are awkward. The door makes a really hollow noise when you open it and the handle retracts. This is more of a quality issue but makes the car ""cheap"" sounding and I bought a Murano that has possibly every option on it and this is a little annoying. There is also a ""flapping"" noise on the roof when I have driven on the freeway. I will have this checked at the dealership. I previously purchased (and still own) a Pathfinder and it had an issue with the roof racks so I am assuming this is also related to the roof racks.   Other than these minor issues I am very pleased with the car and have had many compliments on the looks of it. The Midnight Edition is a nice touch."
I really like the size of it. I downsized from a Pathfinder (that I passed on to my son with child) as I didn't need a 7 passenger vehicle any longer (I do miss the cargo space though).   The Apple Car Play is a great option. The style of the car is great. Looks great and I have the Midnight Edition that adds lots of character. The remote start and air conditioned seats are a must for me since I live in the south and a black on black car gets a little hot. The APP that allows me to remote start the car while I am in the grocery store is an added bonus. Drives really well and performs good.
"I think that Nissan for the most part (I did have issues with my transmission in the Pathfinder, the transmission was replaced) builds a great looking and reliable product for a reasonable price point. This is the second new Nissan vehicle that I have purchased and have had no issues (other than the transmission) with them."
"Back up camera, satellite radio"
Gas mileage is just okay everything else is great.
"The amber light that indicates another car to the side is too dim to see during bright sunshine (most days in South Florida).    Transmission seems to need another low gear, as it shifts noticeably at slow speeds.    Back up camera is useless when raining. Water covers the camera lens.    Undercarriage seems to have a low hanging bar towards the rear."
"Technology. Bells and whistles. Remote start, rear seat up and down with button, etc.    Collision avoidance.    Apple Play.    Styling."
Have already had several people ask me how I liked it and gave them two thumbs up.
Not real sure of gas mileage at this time so I have no issues with car.
Appearance and drive.
Really like it so far.
INTERIOR HATCH RELEASE SHOULD BE STANDARD.  CARGO SPACE COULD BE A LITTLE LARGER.
"GOOD RIDE, VERY UPSCALE APPEARANCE AND AMENTITIES FOR A REASONABLE PRICE.  MAIN POSITIVE:  MY WIFE LOVES IT!"
"SPECIFICALLY, I WOULD RECOMMEND LYNN LAYTON NISSAN/CADILLAC. BEST CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE IN MY LIFE.  WOULD RECOMMEND SALES REP, NORRIS GHOLSTON, TO ANYONE.  I HAVE OWNED SEVERAL NISSAN'S AND THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A QUALITY VEHICLE."
"I liked the center console of older model better. I really liked the look of older model better. I like carpeted floor mats. Mine has plastic where I put my foot, and I hate that. Of course, ?I wish I got better mileage."
The seats are comfortable. The backseat is roomy. It drives well.
I like my car.
Needs no improvement. Love my murano
Overall quality
Because I love the vehicle
More interior storage compartments.
"Ride, appearance and comfort."
First Nissan I have owned
"Get rid of the cheap, plastic overlay on the console, dash and doors. It stands out because the overall quality of the inside is so much better."
"The comfort and overall quality of the interior, as well as the new technology."
I would recommend Nissan to anyone because I have such a good experience with both the vehicles and service departments.
Less expensive!!!!!
Low mileage
"10 is perfect, no one is perfect"
"Continue with gas mileage improvements over time.  Overall body width could be a bit narrower it possible.  Other than that, love the vehicle!"
Overall ride and performance and technology features.
I am not one to push my opinion on decision making to others.  I will be happy to discuss with them but it is their decision overall.
"There is nothing.  We love our Murano.  My spouse is total disabled veteran with a back condition.  And, the seats in the Murano are comfortable and allow him to be able to drive long hours again on long trips.  That is something he has not been able to do for years.  We feel that we found the best vehicle for our current life."
"There is so many things we enjoy about our vehicle.  We enjoy the comfortable seating, good gas milage and other options.  I can not say enough , we do not have any complaints about the Murano and we enjoy the model we have."
"Again, we enjoy everything about the Murano.  We have owned many cars.  For us , this vehicle meets everything we need for our current lifestyle.  We love to travel.  Our Murano did wonderful in fuel use on our recent 3625 mile trip.  We travel up and down over mountains.  It handled wonderful.  Again, with my spouse with a back condition, the seats gave him the ride he needed."
better paint finish
total package
they seam to be good in all ways
"The whole package is great,except for the mileage is not what was stated."
"We have owned several Nissans and we keep going back to purchase more,so we must like them."
Would like  heads up siplay and foot controlled tailgate
I love my Nissan. The ride quality and reliability is outstanding
Better gas mileage would be nice
Looks and quality
We have owned several through the years and any problems have been fixed and they have been very reliable
Better gas mileage
The inside
Because I like it
I love it.
Interior cock pit feel
It is my third and Nissan keeps improving the quality and looks.
Nothing! I love it!
Comfort
The whole experience has been great!
Just like it so I would recommend it
The fuel economy of the vehicle seems like it lags behind other vehicles in its class.
"It feels like we purchased a luxury vehicle for much better, more reasonable purchase price."
"I've owned a  Nissan since I was a freshman in high school. That truck was reliable and had utility. Every Nissan  that I have owned it since, has offered the same reliability and utility."
I guess it can not be fixed on my vehicle ?? maybe something to be considered in the future..
People my age I'm 64 will expect 100% reliability on a car you own!!
I'm very satisfied.
"Because if the overall performance and beauty. I especially like the soft seats,gas mileage and ease of driving."
I like it
Easy to maneuver.
"I've own 2 other Nissan in the past, never really have any major problem.  Good reliable car."
Wish the vehicle wasn't damaged upon delivery and now a problem with the rear latch on back passenger seat.
Appearance.
Nissan is a good company. It's the Murano that I am not please with.
None I am enjoying my new car
Feels safe and secure
No reason
none
Design
"Love, love, love my new Nissan   It is much nicer and more relaxing to drive than the Lexus I traded in for it.."
All the safety features
Appearance and handling.
All the features
The vehicle is nice looking!!  Love it!
Provide better storage area for driver as well as better location for usb port and charging ability without car running or being in accessory mode.  The plastic molding on the driver side that wraps towards the front of the seat sticks out too much has a rough edge to it and actually rubs against my leg when wearing shorts. Improve the navigation system so that it's much easier to use with voice commands without having to inter physical addressor everything.
"The look of the outside, the ride is great and the quiet interior.  I like the comfort of the seats and the size of the cargo area."
Handling and back up camera
I'm really impressed with this vehicle. I don't think anything needs improving. I'm getting my seats checked for the heat/cooling but it doesn't change how I feel about my vehicle. I love it.
Everything!!!!!
I like the size of a 5 seat SUV.
there is no interior cargo door release on the front control panel
handling
"Other than poor paint on hood and Nissan Connect, I love this vehicle. It is our 6th Nissan / Infiniti product!"
"Aggressive, unique styling. Beautiful interior (love mocha option). Great sound system/navigation/touch screen. Dashboard display between gauges is phenomenal!  If you can get Nissan Connect functioning correctly, you'll have a true winner on your hands!!"
Nothing
Easy to get in and out of
Some way to get better mileage
The ride is comfortable and like sitting up higher than in my old Altima
"other than poor fuel economy (abt 16MPG on local roads) and unidentified squeaking noise, love the car. this is my 4th Murano."
"comfortable car, drives well, looks good, good passenger space. However it's a gas burner. worse than my previous 3 Murano's."
Love the seats and the design of the exterior
I have a broken Gas Cap opener - broke the first day it was used.  Faulty design used a cable vs electronic.
nice ride
"I am really satisfied with my Nissan Murano. The only thing missing that Nissan does not put on their cars are Automatic Dimming High Beam Headlights. This a feature I feel should be on all cars today. Most other manufacturers have this option and am surprised Nissan does not. Also, the USB port located inside of a small flip top compartment in front of the front Console is very difficult to access. There is not much room to maneuver the USB end wire into the port. The leather seat color choices could be improved. A darker tan color would be more practical than the yellowish Beige color. Cargo covers should not be an ""Option"" but included on all Muranos."
"I like the following items the most on my new Murano Platinum:  Intelligent Cruise Control, 360 degree cameras around car, right side parking camera, the entire Navigation system with all of the Voice commands, the driver's information system options in the Odometer/Speedometer screen, the ability to turn on and off all of the safety features of the car, the Blind Side warning system, the classy and stylish exterior body design, the seats are out of this world comfortable, the heated and cooled seats, the Bose sound system, the memory steering wheel and seats positions, the self starting ignition and automatic front window roll down when approaching the vehicle from a distance, the quiet and smooth ride, the extended Moon Roof to the back seat, the plentiful room inside the cabin and cargo area and finally the good gas mileage for a 6 cylinder car."
Front passenger seat should have an adjustable feature.
Its design and overall value for the money.
"Comfort, ride, interior design."
Getting the sound right in radio and phone
"Size and ease of entry. A very comfortable car, smooth riding and quiet"
Please help me get my problem with the steering resolved.
Overall look. Interior
"Replace audio system. I am not going to bring it back and forth til it is corrected and taking time and getting a loaner.  I have found initial problems rarely corrected.  Ultimately the problem existed when auto was made. (Henry Ford would have said ""give this lady a new radio"".  My children are driving Nissans and as I explained, this is my 4th.  Love the car, not crazy about the ergonomic seats, but adjusting."
"Love the driving and feeling of safety.  Driving grandchildren from day care.  Most important issue for me.  New design most attractive. Has a sporty appearance.  Have also used the same sales person as have my children.  I do not ""shop"" prices.  Satish goes beyond expectations of a salesman.  Most cooperative and always accommodating."
I forgot to mention that my rear wiper intermittent is not working properly.  this happened in the winter and I have not brought it in for service yet. The reason I bought another Murano is that my 2014 had so many flaws... when we saw the new 2016 model many of what I did not like on the 2014 was reworked.  Nissan Connect is something that can be worked... not happy about that.
"style, comfort, and the fixes from my 2014 to the 2016"
Utilize Apple Carplay
"I love the exterior design and all the lines on it. It is really sharp. The touch screen entertainment is nice, but surprised climate cannot be controlled there either and it still resorts to knobs."
A larger fuel tank and a little better fuel economy
The interior styling and comfort
I am very happy with my vehicle overall
the smooth ride
love my Murano
Every thing
A better rear window view.  Head rest are uncomfortable.  They also mess up your hair.

"Make the glare go away on the instrument panel, navigation system."
The look and comfort.
MAKE IT A CONVERTIBLE W/ A TWIN TURBO 400HP ENGINE---JUST KIDDING.   I GREATLY MISS THE KEYPORT IN THE THE DASHBOARD THAT MY 2010 MURANO HAD. THE TWO (2) STORAGE AREAS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CENTER CONSOLE ARE TOO SMALL/NARROW.
THE OVERALL LOOKS AND STYLING OF BOTH THE EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR IS SPECTACULAR!!! I HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS POSITIVE COMMENTS ON MY NEW MURANO PLATINUM. THE TECHNOLOGY IS ALSO IMPRESSIVE.
Incorporate Android Auto and make it available as an update to owners.
roominess and accessories
Everything is great
Volume on Bluetooth phone varies from just right to overly loud. Any changes in the preferences does not correct the issue.
All of the technology - blind spot warning and predictive cruise control.
"A/C fan is rather noisy, but quieter than my 2003 Murano.  I had moon roof open one day on the coast; it was noisy and put a glare on the windshield.  Disappointed that I have had two recalls so far."
"The Pacific Sunset color, although I liked the original copper color better.  I also prefer the matching copper colored seats on my 2003 Murano."
My vehicle was supposed to have a car starter and it doesn't. The dealer will not do anything to fix the situation. I'm really upset about it.   Gas mileage could be better.
Look and drive!
"Improved fuel economy  Design of rear allows for dust, dirt to accumulate constantly.  Requires daily  Cleaning after driving, even though car is garaged."
"Looks,comfort, style (except back window), safety features"
"Better speakers, overall satisfactory"
That's the point of taking survey..the info is at your hands.Action taken by Nissan will either advance sales or not ..Respectfully John Badillo.
One can beat new..
A mid-range vehicle for the price that you're charging should come as standard feature side view heated mirrors it's a safety issue we drove in the snow all day and could not use our mirrors very dangerous poor design so this should be a recall and install them for safety issues. Number 2 the hood design is of poor design there is a two to three inch strip that is right in front of your eyes right after the windshield wipers that if the Sun hits it at the right angle it creates a glare a blinding glare it's a hazard safety issue I believe some sort of maybe black strip that the dealership would install to help stop this glare it should be a recall before someone gets hurt or worse.
The overall style and the look of the vehicle and the ride and the color which on our vehicle happens to be Pacific sunset.
The lighting in the cargo section is very bad. Only one light inside. No lights on the lift gate.
"The only issue that we had when purchasing this vehicle was waiting so long to be able to purchase it. We spoke with the dealer in the fall of 2015, and were told that the car could not yet be ordered. The dealer kept in contact with us frequently throughout the next 6 months with presumptive order dates. The order was finally placed on the first available day that it could be, however the dealer was then able to locate an already delivered model prior to our ordered unit coming in, as we were leaving on vacation, and did not want to put extra miles on our trade in vehicle as it would not have been fair to the dealer."
Sporty look and handling
Correct the over-boosted steering at highway speeds.  (See other comments.)
"Form and function is right for me.  Reasonable style, economy, sportiness, utility,    luxury, safety, technical features, & comfort.   Disappointed that range was decreased due to gas tank capacity being reduced from previous model Murano.   Also, Tow-Rating was also decreased from previous model Murano."
Comfort
the windshield and side windows could have been cleaned more thoroughly.  Adhesive and residue from window stickers became obvious after a week.
the level of technology is very high
Have owned it for only 3 months.  Absolutely nothing at this time.
The interior is close to being a luxury car.  Everything is so user friendly and works dso easy.  I love my Murano.
Everything
more storage space would be nice.
this is hard to answer--the cold seats!  I have a back problem and the cold feels so good as well as the lumbar.
overall I am pleased with the vehicle. Have not yet had the opportunity to take a road trip--all driving to this point has been local and city.  I do like the response of the variable transmission.
won't be leasing another Nissan again
"Need better quality checks. (misaligned hood, missing fasteners under hood for flaps)  Put more thought into usability - currently no good spot to place a phone other than cup-holder.  Abnormal noise is a big concern. Vehicle is still under warranty, but still."
"Zero gravity Seats, appearance (exterior and interior)"
Good thing there's video and blindspot cameras without them I would not have taken the car. Blindspots are terrible.
The interior and exterior look. Plus the gas mileage.
"Add navegation to all murano model. Like mine, i love everything but i hate that  i was told i had navegation and after i signed paperwork, and paid down payment of 15,000$ it didnt have it, and all i got was sorry i thought it did. It was a really turn off, but other thn that i love my nissan murano."
"The drive, and it looks like an out of space ship"
I love it!
"Ride, performance, gas milage"
Fix the problem or allow me to swap with vehicle of like kind that all the features work properly.
At this moment.......I am not happy with my vehicle at all!
I had to have the transfer case pulled immediately because it was leaking gear oil.  All seals had to be replaced.  This is a known problem in this vehicle.  Nissan needs to address it.
Style/features
style and safety features
"There is an open area between the left passenger seat and the middle seat and the same exist between the drivers seat and the console. For the dealership to take the customer seriously when issues are raised as it relates to identified problems. The leather interior is dull, exchange this vehicle for another. It has less than 4000 miles."
"I like the way it drives, fuel economy and the extra room."
"Nothing but dust collects on rear window, I guess all SUV's have that issue"
"I love everything about my new Murano. I have not real problem other than my Windows phone not being compatible with the NissanConnect which is not a major deciding factor of overall purchase. Front seatbelts are a little hard to get to engage into place, have to wiggle it sometimes to get it to fasten and click."
"Difficult to narrow down but I believe the comfort of the seats while driving. I have medical condition/issues that cause constant pain and the comfort level of my Murano's seats with the heat and cooling options make it so much easier on me for long trips as well as running around town. Plus the steering/handling overall and being able to reach controls adds to the comfort and ease, making it a joy!"
"After my purchase I was disappointed to discover I could not use voice text to send a text because my wife and I have I phones. Really, arguably the most popular cell phone on the market and between Nissan and apple this couldn't be figured out. Please get this worked out."
"The comfort ,room, and fuel economy."
"its beautiful, good gas mileage, comfortable"
COULD BE A BIT QUIETER INSIDE DURING HIGHWAY SPEEDS
STYLING
i am satisfird with my murano
looks
"Been looking to install a roof rack, but nothing is available for it, not even from Nissan."
All the technical aspects.
It needs more safety features on the SV.
The overall comfort of the seats and the nice overall space of the insides.
Improve Bluetooth connectivity issues.
Feels and looks like a high-end brand.
The body style
Gas mileage sucks compared to listed mileage. 18 in the city? Should be 24. Too much of a gap. Only 1400 miles on car so maybe engine still needs broken in.no automatic wipers? Our 2013 platinum murano had them?
Interior is awesome. Smooth ride
I love LOVE the Murano!  It is one of my most favorite vehicles ever!  This is the 3rd one I have owned since 2003.  I purchased a Juke in 2011 and traded it in for a Murano because I missed the luxury and beauty of that vehicle.  I knew when I was purchasing the vehicle that it was going to have a comparably low MPG compared to the Juke.  If/when there is a Hybrid Murano I would consider moving to that.
"I love the spacious interior, I love how quiet it is.  And it just looks so elegant on the outside.  The new line of Murano is seriously the most attractive you have ever produced!"
"Every car has little quirks, right now I don't feel there is anything so bad that there is definite need for improvement. This car still doesn't have 3000 miles on it. There is a lot more time ahead for things that may need to be improved"
Looks and comfort
My daughter said the back seat is not as comfortable as a Nissan pathfinder.
the pear exterior and the mocha interior combination.  I fell in love with it as soon as I saw it.
"At this time, I think Nissan has done an exceptional job with the new Murano.   All that have seen the vehicle admire the design.    Keep the fine work."
The futuristic look.
Outstanding
None.  Excellent for its size.
Everything.
So far I am loving my decision to purchase the new Murano. The only thing I would probably add is that there should be a cargo net in the trunk or some type of storage bin or box as a part of the price of the car.
I love the seats. They are the most comfortable seats I have sat in. I also like the smooth ride of the car.

"Bring back the rain-sensing wipers. ???? Fuel release lever should be a button like my old Murano. New lever is cheap and flimsy - definitely not up to the same quality standard as the rest of the interior finishes.  Acceleration can feel somewhat sluggish at times. Murano could use more horsepower or maybe better tuned transmission?  Comparable Crossovers in this class provide a better driving experience, but this was not as important to me as the styling and tech features."
"Interior and exterior styling, adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitoring, and the nav/stereo/information system (easy to use and cool)"
"Technology, seats"
Airbag turns off when I am in the paassenger seat  I only weigh 100 lbs.  Plan to take in to dealership to have it checked.
How it drives and fuel mileage.
I am a senior citizen and therefore not very tech savvy. While I appreciate all of the tech applications and safety features on the vehicle the instruction manuals are hard for me to follow and understand. Perhaps a hands on course form the dealer over a months period of time might be helpful for someone like me.
The overall appearence and the new safety features.
I like it as it is. No comment about improvement
I just like it
"every thing is superb for me and someone help meto buy a car but till now he haven't receive the referral fee. The agent is doing hesitate to give that referral money. The agent name is otto and his phone number is 713-885-2473. if you really take care of the customer, call this guy and make him to pay referral money to leela sanyasi who took nissan dealer and helped me to buy a car. call leela on this number, 7133848960 after you call that guy(Otto)."
every thing is awesome but it used more gas. so need to control on it.
I love my car
Everything
I love my Murano other than the seat issue and the phone issue. IPhone on car will not read tex messages
"Good ride. Comfortable, lots of room"
"I knew this when buying it, but it's too bad Nissan had to make the Murano larger. I do believe there was room in the market for both Rogue and Nissan, at the prior size model. It served no purpose to increase the size and it's already a formidable front end and difficult to see over it. Also, in the Seattle area, parking spaces are extremely narrow. The new Murano is both wider and longer, and the width makes it difficult to park. Ask me about my new Rogue."
"quiet, technology, safety"
There is nothing I can add. I love this vehicle!
The sleek design and smooth ride.

"Style, would like more options on since it is top of line model,maybe a heads up display."
"Apple Play & the android equivalent, along with a more reliable bluetooth connection. I had the same issues in my 2013 Altima; this intermittent problem needs to be fixed."
The quiet cabin! I love how quiet the powerful motor is. And how roomy it is. I also love how it looks.
"Hey, this is the best vehicle I have ever owned. I bought one years ago and it was so great that I bought another one. Boy, how they have improved the Murano!  Only one thing I would change is the wheels. I think they need to be more shinny  for the class and looks of the rest of the car but overall love my Murano!"
The ride and all the room inside the cabin. Has the best ride and love the paint color  as it is Cayenne Red. What a beautiful red! Looks better than the Lexus.
Just wish I had more of the safety breaking systems on it .
I like its looks !
Every murano & Rouge rear view mirror fails 2 adequately adjust light from vehicle behind in dark.  Close vehicle & it stops working so glare unchecked.  Also fails at intermittent distances.  Long time frustration. Always reach for old time mirror to adjust of course to no avail.  Long time Murano owner.
"Long time owner of several. 2015/2016 only problem years.  All around perfect.  Would love heated steering wheel in SL as don't enjoy Platinum upgrades, especially tech."
"For me, no improvement. Very happy with the purchase."
The most I like is the smooth ride.
The front seat fabric does not seem to fit or be tailored as well as it should.

This is the third Murano I have leased.  Each one is better than the last one.  Good job Nissan.

There was a very small pait chip on one of the rear view mirrors. The dealer repaired it.
"The look, comfort and the ride."
slower than my  2009  murano quality was better on interior fit an exterior too
ride and  electronics for drive
"The biggest issue that I have with my new Murano is the lack of color match of the exterior paint. Having owned both a previous model Murano and a Nissan 350Z that came from the factory with perfectly matched paint, I was not expecting to find this issue in my 2016 Murano."
"I am well satisfied with the style and comfort of the vehicle's interior, the exterior style and the smooth ride."
I would have liked the cruse to be on all the time instead of having to press the on button every time you start the car.
Sit up higher in the vehicle.
overall very pleased with my Murano
"Front bumper must have a higher clearance, I have heated seats, cooling would have been nice."
Smooth ride
The ride and the radio and the look of it
Lane departure system with notification.  Alert sound system have a switch to turn on or off.  More HP and torque without decreasing MPG.  A hybrid engine option.
"A difficult question to answer, there is not anything that I dislike about this vehicle.  Also there is nothing that I am overjoyed about either.  We traded in a 2015 Subaru Outback solely because it had a 4cyl engine at 175 HP which for me was inadequate.  Consumer Report gave the Murano an outstand rating and that is the reason we select this vehicle.  The adaptive cruise control and lane departure in the Subaru excels over the Murano."
Please consider females more in development of your seats and headrests. I'm am of a shorter stature and sometime find it harder to get my seat adjusted just right.
Style and technology
"Don't get me wrong, I love my Murano but the gas mileage is terrible. I drive quite a bit and have to fill my tank up about twice per week."
The Murano is sexy and looks high quality. I'm proud to drive it.
"The screen for using sound system, navigation, etc. is very difficult to see in the sunlight. Recessing that screen would make it easier to see."
Appearance and value
"reduce road noise at highway speeds...must raise volume on radio to compensate. Improve sound quality of stereo system...Platinum Edition,"
appearance and overall quality. Dig the wheels. Smart key. Tail gate operation. Smooth engine and transmission.
"The main thing I wish my 2016 Murano had is power seats.  I knew ahead of time that the particular model I purchased didn't have them.  Other than that, I am very pleased with my vehicle."
It's a very sporty looking crossover.
Had rain sensing wipers on last three vehicles--would like that here.
Like that overall availability of features it has.
"I wish the stereo etc. stayed on after the vehicle was turned off, but before the doors are opened (like on most other top end vehicles of today). The vehicle is also a ""bug magnet"". I installed an after market bug shield and that helped a little."
it gets a lot of attention :-) and the ride is great down our country roads
Better gas mileage and a smoother transmission..
"The technology , the appearance and the comfort."
I am completely satisfied with my new Murano.
"The smooth ride, the color and interior and the look of the suv."
Passenger seat could have full control instead of just front and back
"Overall it is a great car, my first new car ever."
l
love car!  a wire harness came undone and interfered with the gas pedal.  This was the problem with car not floor mat.  Problem was not listed.
Nothing
"This is my third Murano.  I bought the first one in 2003.  Since then, the quality and overall style of the Murano has continued to improve.  I could not be happier with this vehicle.  It seems that the 2016 model (SL) has a lot more zip than the 2012 model.  The 2016 model also seems more solid and stable while driving."
The style.  The feeling of stability while driving at any speed.  The quality.
"I have not found anything I would change.  My new car is beautiful, elegant, and serene.  Plus it gets up and goes!  Love it!!"
"The exterior lines and ""wow"" factor!  I don't feel like just another drone driving down the road.  I AM ALL THAT:)"
Have the dealer fix the wind noise in the driver passenger window/door.  This is not something that should be occurring in a quality vehicle.
it is quiet and rides like an old Buick ( that is a compliment)
Make more options available at a reasonable cost and NOT tagged on with other with other options.
The looks and quality.
"High quality all around, safety features and smooth ride with lots of room"
The storage area should be made a little larger in the backseat should also be cool or warm  also my remote start doesn't work good distance I didn't have a lot of problems with getting it started even if I am pretty close to the car
I love the car rides well very comfortable in the car love the color inside and out
Cargo space is small.
A bigger gas tank.  So far it seems that with this smaller tank we travel a lesser distance before refueling.
We truly like the vehicle.  This is our third Murano and the changes over the years have made it so much better.
Evrything
"If you could fix the problems that would be great!   I truly fear for my life with the hesitation that the car has when I am turning onto main roads. engine just bogs down and goes 0-60 in 30 seconds like a snail.  From a straight stop it is fine and has wonderful pick up, but from a right turn the car just gives up and is at risk of being struck from oncoming vehicles."
It looks really nice  Blind spots are also a huge concern base model has no alerts and have had 4 occasions where blind spots nearly caused accidents. This car can be very scary!!!
Remote starting option needs to be easier to operate.
"Handling, space, plush interior"
Looks and comfort
Phone system is a problem and need to be fixed. the noisiness of the car is a problem
Looks
exterior and interior looks.  satelite system.  back up camera.
The technology related to safety.
The seat is a little short and the audio in my old maxima was much better than my murano.  It doesn't feel as strong. That's the only word I can think of right now. It just sounds weak unless you turn it up and then it's so so.
I love the way it drives on long trips. I LOVE the smart cruise control. I love the panoramic opening in the roof. I love how easy the navigation is to use. It is a wonderful car.
The seat belt warning chime does not work. There was no wiper fluid in the wiper container.
"The look, the body style, the color, the way it drives, the comfort of the seats. The air and heat controls are very simple to operate. The gas mileage is not awful."
Make interior more accessible almost impossible to apply seat belts far reach etc.
"After buckled in, love all."
Simplify audio and navigation system.  location of usb port difficult to access.
Peppy engine.  Overall appearance of vehicle.
i love that vehicle nothing could be done
the way it looks
Voice to text doesn't work with IPhone.  That's very surprising.  Bose system - doesn't seem like sound is coming from anywhere but front speakers.  Would've preferred a CD system that could hold 5-6 CDs at a time.
The safety features including cruise control.  The touch panel system is very user friendly AND that it shows up on screen directly in front of driver.  Like that the dome lights come on at nite while driving - but aren't a distraction to driver.  Love the look of the car.  Just drove it from Florida to Ohio and it was a very comfortable trip.
"There is only 1200 miles on the car now, I have a appointment 6/2/16 to address the issues."
"Looks, Ride,Comfort, Acceleration and Gas mileage."
Looks and safety
More sound insulation
driving
"I can really feel bumpy roads but great on smoother roads. I don't really feel much cool when the seat cooler is on. Otherwise, I love my car!"
"Looks of it, safety features (cameras), electronics."
THIS IS MY 3RD MURANO.  I GUESS THAT SAYS IT ALL.
EVERYTHING!!!
"Compartment for USB port is positioned in a way where it is difficult to insert/connect charger cable    Air vent in back would be better from the ceiling, small children end up kicking it and may damage it by accident     There should be an option to use the screen to view Netflix/movies etc"
"I like the overall horse power, smooth traction, comfortability, communication availability, reverse camera, sleek style"
At this point I am very pleased.
The body style.  The fuel mileage.  The leg room and the seats are very comfortable.
I love this vehicle . So nothing.
luxury of it and the way it hugs the road .
bluetooth and cruise control
"The front hood material comes too high up near the windshield, which makes it hard to see when making a left turn.  Design it where on both sides of the hood, you take and round off about 4 inches closest to the windshield."
Crazy about the look!!!!!
"Find a better position for seatbelt latch. Allow more features on touch screen, like adding personal images and saving music like jeeps. Sensitivity of belt locking as it becomes a hazard when it locks and driver is trying to check blindspots. I love the style but the underside of back hatch does not get cleaned during a wash."
Seats!!! Very comfy.
I'm extremely disappointed that the Nissan version of On-Star wasn't available with this vehicle.     The glove-compartment is awkwardly low and impossible to see in to when seated.
The seating room is awesome and it's very comfortable when traveling.
"1. When I took the car for the new car service check up, I told the tech about the window issue. He said I needed to make a separate appointment because they'd need to take the door apart to fix it. I went back for my second appointment and after 45 minutes or so, I was told they couldn't  fix it & needed to order parts. This requires yet another appointment in my brand new Nissan. The service department is supposed to call when the parts are in. That was 2.5 weeks ago & I haven't heard from them yet.  2. I repeatedly have an ABS & AWD warning lights activate upon braking & just received a recall notice which requires yet another trip to the service department.   I'm spending entirely too much time/gas/mileage trying to get this car in the shape it should have been upon delivery. I'm pretty disappointed. I was considering a Rogue as a 2nd vehicle when I sell my Mini but have decided I'm probably better in a different brand."
It's a nice looking car & rides pretty smoothly. It also has enough cargo space for our travels. It was also priced competitively.
"I like the appearance, Nissan Connect, overall driving experience."
nothing
sound system and comfortable ride
"So far, I am very happy with the vehicle as is."
"Exterior styling by far!  You have always been on the cutting edge from when you first introduced the first model Murano.  We bought tour first Murano   in 2009.  The Honda Pilot, please!!   You beat the hell out of your competition when it comes to exterior styling."
"Bucket back seats would be nice, but it would reduce number of occupants.  Cooled back seats would be a nice option.  An AC adapter for a power source would be helpful.  The insert tray in the console is cheap looking.   The back seats do t retract smoothly after they are laid down flat."
The technology.  The sleek interior and exterior look!  The smooth ride. Decent gas mileage.
My vehicle is perfect.
Roominess and technology. Also the sporty exterior of the car. Overall an awesome vehicle
Fix Nissan connect!  Give us what you promised us on your home page and dealership pamphlets!
Looks good.
fix the rattles and the phone connection
pretty interior
"If I  have an early morning appt for a recall fix, I would like to get my car back in a reasonable time frame not over 8 hours wait for a 1.5 hour job."
"I like the automatic adjustable seat when I start the car, the overall looks are great as are the smooth ride and acceleration."
"Appearance, comfort, econamy."
"Appearance, inside and out.  Surround cameras.  Gas mileage."
"It's a gorgeous vehicle, great design this year.  Love the sporty look and the size is exactly what I was looking for."
"Update gps, find a product to clean leather."
Everything is great
It's sporty look
Nothing.  I absolutely love my new car.  I especially like the safety features such as the back up view.
"I like the smooth ride, the safety features such as the back up view, the warning sounds when changing lanes.  I also love the way it looks."
Include camera based video recording ...
"style, comfort and ease of driving ..."
"Bose sound system does not sound as good as the Rockford Fosgate systems available in trucks.  Bass is muffled and not sharp.  The ""Spare Tire"" subwoofer leaves a lot to be desired.  Should also have the telematics system.  Other that that it is a great vehicle."
Overall appearance and performance.  Very good value.  Looks like a much more expensive vehicle.
Driver and passenger door storage has gone from great in the first Muranos to almost non existent in the 2013 and worse in the 2016.
"360 camera system, interior and exterior appearance and the so much improved CVT. Now if ONLY it had paddle shifters on the steering wheel. Acutally I LIKE EVERYTHING other than poor door storage."
my old morano had more storage spaces than the new one
The looks and the shape of the new morano and driving it all is good quality
"With the money I spent, this was the best choice."
The lift gate needs to lift higher.  I keep hitting my head because it is so low.
Exterior and interior style
The comfort and reliable SUV that drives with assurance of handling any type of driving long or short mileage distance.
shy of turning it in early (in a 36 month lease).....
looks nice
"It saved my life. After a horrendous accident where my murano rolled twice and I had to be cut out of the driver's seat, my husband walked away with a dislocated finger. I had some bruises and burns. It was absolutely incredible."
"The vehicle is what I expected.  The service is excellent, and the salesman was  outstanding."
"reliability, appearance, design, an interior features."
Everything
Not much
Improve gas mileage. Gas gauge goes down all of a sudden. More seat adjustments and stearing wheel adjustments.
automatic trans. Music sound.
"Except for the MINOR issues discussed earlier in survey, there's not much that could be done to improve how I feel about it.  I still love the car and have no regrets."
Technology.  Connectivity is excellent.  Driving aids are fantastic.
Nothing that I can think of.
The look
"leave it  alone,its ok-ok"
"automatic breaking w/cruse control,quite in side smooth ride,over all great car"
Not one thing
Iike every thing
The aforementioned items.
"All the safety features,  which are new to me."
Located the memory seat controls on the upper part of door.  Not where leg or hip can bump.
Ease of driving and design.
Was very upset about the tire air pressure = 45 pounds was a dangerous situation.  Car dealer corrected the problem. Should have been checked.  Going in for an oil change at the end of this month -hopefully fluid levels and tires will be checked.
seats are comfortable. Good ride.
Still feel there are blind spots. The warnings have been a great help.
Like how it handles.  Seems easier than the 2015 I had.
"We only have 1600 miles on vehicle.  We really love the Murano and even though it has been a bit of a learning curve, we would do it all over again."
Size - color - interior - technology
"I am very pleased with this vehicle, but not with the dealership nor Nissan customer service.  This is my third Nissan, but frankly may be my last."
"Handling, style and features, with the exception of being provided with an outdated navigational map."
"My only concern is that if you try to check over your right shoulder before changing lanes, there is a blind spot with the side panel.  But I am learning to rely on my mirrors.  Overall, I LOVE my Murano."
"I fell as if I am driving a much more expensive car, love the handling, the ride, braking, looks, great, great car!"
"This is my opinion, my wife is the one who drives the car."
I like the Brand.
Nothing comes to mind --- great vehicle !
Interior comfort & Reliability
I would have a chime reminder for the seatbelt buckling for all passengers.  I would prefer the steering had a stiffer response.
"Overall exterior design, interior design and ride."
Cut down outside noise and better iPhone menu connection and navi save screen is not friendly
"Size, power, leather, back up camera, Bluetooth , navi, e-brake for front, keyless start and fob, res"
"My wife has been in the hospital for over a month and half of that in intensive care, and now I am working and trying to take care of her now that she's home. So I haven't had the chance to take my vejicle back to the dealer."
"It's a great looking car, and handles and drives well."
"Overall, we have been very happy with the Murano. The exterior design gave us pause and we originally bought a 2016 Acura instead because of the design but ultimately traded that for the 2016 Murano. If a hybrid had been available or a diesel, we would have considered those options depending on the mileage.  Also, the NissanConnect in our vehicle is useless and should be eliminated or made into a useful addition."
It feels very solid on the highway and there is ample storage space for trips. The pickup is good when passing and the transmission is very smooth. Sound system is also excellent.
I am a little concerned that it seems to drive with my foot off the pedal. I can let go of brake at a stop sign and it drives.
I love the comfort of the seats and features such as back up camera and keyless entry. The height of the vehicle is perfect.
The stiching in the leather...
I love the exterior....lots of personality....love the color the interior color...the sound system..the gps.....
Nothing! Truly love my Murano.
Ease of driving. Sound. Attractiveness.
iwould like to  have  Bose  speaker  it s  music  sound  better.  thank you
Passenger seat to have same adjustment positions as driver.  Visibility on either side of windshield is somewhat limited by support frame work.
Exterior and exterior appearance   .
Nothing.  I love it.
The handling. It is heavy and powerful compared to my Cadillac SRX's that I have owned in the past. It has a lot more power.
On-screen tutorials for navigation and other options available. Full disclosure of cell phones that don't work with your system
The overall handling of the car is great.the interior is classy and thesound system awesome! Not to mention it is a beautiful car!
"Maybe, power seats on all models."
The body styling and rims
Better gas mileage would be the only thing that would make it more attractive.
The smoothness of the ride. Also like the look of the interior and exterior.
I wish the headlights automatically dimmed and brightened. I wish that the cupholders had heat and cooling I wish the passenger side seat had lumbar support in the seat.
Love it's roominess to haul things very comfy and drives nice.
Narrower console and more driver leg room width.  More storage area in console. I miss the extra space my 2011 Murano had in the center console.  Forward vision is obstructed by the high hood line. Makes the car seem much wider than it is.  Large pillar and mirror block view to right. 2011 Murano had same problem. There's no good sense of where the right side of the car is when turning right.
Color. Style. Adaptive cruise. All around camera view for parking. Gas mileage.
Make it more fuel efficient!
The comfortable interior and how it looks.  I also like the smoothness of the ride!
What I feel about my vehicle is unimportant to me.  What I think about it is quite important.  I think it will be a reliable vehicle that will suit my purposes for many years.  It drives and handles like a dream.  All of the systems are user friendly.
"Driving performance, i.e., acceleration, braking, cornering."
None
Everything
I can't think of anything. We are impressed with all the features on our new Murano and are still learning how to use them.
Handling and ease of driving.  Stylish looking. Safety features including blind spot cameras.
I think it's a major safety issue not to have the doors automatically lock once the car is started.  I can sometime drives through a complete parking lot before the lock engages.  Glad the bad guys aren't after me once I enter my car.  I'd have to THINK about hitting the lock instead of it automatically locking.
"The look and style of the car, sitting up high, the auto brake and beeping warning system (when it works)."
The new body style and engine performance
Improve the functionality between the car and my iPhone.
The comfort and driveability is outstanding.  Seats are some of the best ever!

"Offer more options to add some of the features of the packages (SL, SV) in the S model.  For example, it would be nice to upgrade the sound system without all of the options in the upper packages.  On the nissan website there is not even an option to purchase the upgrades."
The looks and the driveability.
Can be a bit bumpy on certain roads. the opal feature on the dashboard sometimes reflects too much light and blinds me.
I like the feel of the car while driving and the comfort of the seats and the luxury feel
Don't put the gas cover pull next to the hood pull.
Comfort and fanciness

"performance, appearance, functionality"
"Improve mileage.  Need more space in rear,like my  nis rogue.  Rear seats don,t slide Fwd or bkwd..."
"Style,transmission, and visibility."
"The only issue I have had so far is that when my husband pulled on the lever to open the gas tank filler door, it disconnected.  He was able to reattach the lever."
There is nothing I do not like most!
I wanted to comment that the driver side door issue was not addressed by the dealership when I brought the vehicle in to address the dash harness blocking the brake pedal as it was stated that it would take multiple hours to reseat the door and I was not offered a courtesy vehicle and could not miss that much work time.
It is my 1st SUV after always having a sedan nice to be higher up and have more room
Im very disappointed overall its been 2 weeks and They have not fix my suv
"Nothing yet, I cant drive it"
Wish it has better mileage.
It does not work and that is the ONLY issue/complaint we have with the vehicle. It would be nice if Nissan could work with Apple to get that feature made available as soon as possible!
"Comfort, fuel economy, stereo"
"Love the car, very sharp and comfortable ride"
"The navigation, blind spot detection and fuel efficient."
Love the 2016 design
The dealer could address the transmission issue and buff out the paint on the hood.
The car overall is very nice and the engine is great.
Keep making more Murano's
Everything
connection to cell phone=   the reading of text messages does not always work.  Not easy to fix.

I don't know I almost got rear-ended the first time with the hesitation of the transmission I'm almost scared to drive the vehicle
I truly love the interior

"Three things. One, the console lid does not open completely vertically limiting access when driving. Two, the small compartment in front of the console should open away from the console, not towards it. I and the passenger are behind the open compartment and can not see inside it without leaning forward. Three, the interior dome lights are not adequate. Very dim. My previous cars could light up the inside and rear of the cars with no problems. Had I test driven this car at night, I may not have bought it. I traded in a 2015 Toyota Highlander Platinum for this car. It was a tough choice, and like I said, I may not have purchased this car for that reason. It's very irritating to have to pull out a flashlight to read written directions or anything else at night. Nissan needs to revisit these issues."
"Overall quality, styling, seats, transmission."
"Different latch for rear door hatch.  Also, I would/should have gotten ""blind spot"" alert.  There is a distinct blind spot."
"technology, performance and appearance."
keep manufacturing them just the way you are at this time.
"appearance, ride, style, quality of finish"
Everything.
"This is my second Murano in our household.  There were two recalls within weeks after purchase.  I took it in and the mechanics said I did not have the bad ABS sensor and the passenger seat airbag sensor was working.  Frankly, I can no know for a fact this is true.  It is a matter of trust.  I do NOT like looking at the yellow warning Air Bag 2 is off.  I drive without anyone in that seat ofter (my wife has the other car) and so the light stays on.  Guess I just have to accept that is necessary to see that the sensor is working."
"The style, handling, and quiet ride.  Also, love the new amenities like the warnings of several types and the slow-down when in cruise control and the car ahead is too close.  The bose speakers are great and I LOVE the bluetooth capability.  Just get in the car and listen to my iPhone selections or iMusic.  Overall, this car is much more fun than the 2011 Murano. (Yet with usb I have helped my wife connect with her music.)  The 2016 is fun to drive.  Very smooth transmission."
Lane follow assist technology.  height adjustment on front passenger seat.
Driver assist technology - smart cruise control.  Smooth ride.  space and comfort.
Now that problems are fixed I am thoroughly enjoying my Murano!
Love the way the car handles in traffic and on open road; great sound system; cooling front seats!
The Murano that I owned previously had more head room and it had a higher towing capacity I was very disappointed when I found out that my new Murano Could only go up to 1500 pounds I did not know this when I purchased the vehicle I if I had done more research I would not have purchased the new Muranoshould've done research because the one I had previously would towmy boat  I did not find this out until I got my Murano back from the dealership with the hitch put on it and it was a class one which would not tell my boat for that hitch is 1500 pounds I need at least a class to you if not a class III hitch for my boat even though my boat is approximately 1500 pounds it's at the higher limit of been able to be towed by the Murano the new Murano also doesn't have that headroom which I was OK with but very very disappointed that it would not tell my boat if I had known this I would not have purchased the boat because it has put me in a bind been able to go on trips and not being able to take my boat however it was my mistake I did not research it I did not even think that you would drop the capacity so low that it would not go fishing about
I do like the Murano in the way it runs it's a very smooth ride however I still don't feel it's a smooth as the previous Murano I owned the 2011 it's a very stylish vehicle seating is very it is comfortable and it looks very plush again I feel like though but downsizing the size of the Murano in the towing capacity I will no longer in the future ever probably purchase another Murano for that simple fact
Love my new car...will get it serviced soon (5000 miles)- hope the service department is good.
How it looks
"I probably should have purchased a bigger interior vehicle.  That is what I am used to; however, I like the inside interior to some extent.  One feature in particular is the reclining rear seat upright."
The fuel efficiency caught my eye.  I love the safety features and automatic braking.
"I would like a few more bells and whistles! Air conditioned rear seats, the functionality of the moon roof/sun roof could be enhanced. I love the car - and came from a luxury brand - it competes well."
it's appearance - it's cute!
"I am pleased with just how it is. Roomy, beautiful and great to drive."
Everything. I love how it drives and the sleekness of its appearance.
Nothing

Less black in interior design.

I love my new murano except it's already on a recall for the airbags I am very disappointed!! That's a very serious issue for me...
El maletero se debe serrar solo
Offer more technology. CarPlay should be available in old and new models. Make CarPlay available to current owners not just new ones
"The interior is great, the satellite radio, HD radio,"
Silver trim around front air vents reflects in outside mirrors in daylight to a major distraction.

I am very happy. With my  mutant.  The best car. We have had.   Excuse error. My. Mural.  The sales people are excellent. We have dri ven. Nissans for manY years
"It's difficult to rest my arms in a comfortable position while driving. Also, I wish the steering wheel lowered another inch. The driver'side overall positioning is a bit awkward. Also, the cameras are really needed. I've never had so much difficulty judging the corners of a vehicle."
"Although the driver positioning takes a bit of getting used to, I love driving the Murano. It'seems super smooth, super quiet, handles good, although nobody would mistake it for a sports car. It's a joy to drive. On the previous page...independent climate control for the back seat passengers would be nice."
"When I use my Bluetooth to listen to music, I have to turn the volume all the way up to hear it.  I have checked my phone and the volume is turned up high as well. For music off my phone, the volume needs help.  Also, when I use Bluetooth to speak on my phone, the volume then gets super loud or super quiet.  I have to place my finger on the volume dial while talking so I don't miss what they say or I don't get my ears blown out."
It's just really pretty and drives fantastic.
I have had issues with the forward collision warning system. At my work when I am coming out of parking garage the system kicks in and warns me even though there is no obstacle/vehicle in front. It has applied hard bakes on 4 occasions which results in sudden and unexpected stopping of car. It can be dangerous for passengers in the car and also for any vehicle that might be following my vehicle.
Appearance and overall comfort.
Love the comfort of this year's model. Much roomer than my last one.

"We really like this Murano. We have had 3 Nissan vehicles before, all in the early 2000s and all Altimas (one of those Altimas had terrible issues!).    But we really like this 2016 Murano. We had thought about purchasing a Murano when they first came out. We're glad that we waited!    When one gets ready to fly an airplane, whether a Piper, Beechcraft or Cessna, one can expect the critical features of the cockpit to be similar from airplane to airplane. The auto industry does not share this standard. There's always something different in the way one accesses GPS or other such things."

"I love my Murano, the only annoyance about the interior is that there is a plastic guard in the front part of the lower driver seat that if my leg moves near it, it is uncomfortable as it rubs my leg.  There is sort of a sharp edge on the guard, so I have to remember to not put my leg near that guard."
Everything
"This is my third Murano , I absolutely love this vehicle ! Great job on interior design ! The ride is nice and comfortable ! This 2016 gets better fuel mileage than 2010 and 2013 models ! Transmission seems to shift much smoother ! Would like to see the garnet color in this model !"
Everything !
"I enjoy it very much. I wish there were more online ""how to"" videos to help give me ideas on how to use the voice control features."
The overall height of the vehicle.  It is easy to get in and out of and I like the seat adjustments.  It makes for a comfortable ride.
"I test drove, I think, FIVE Muranos of the same year make/model.  Each one sounded different.  One had a loud whistle when I drove it.  Another had extreme wind noise.  Another had a loud popping sound when I braked (the salesman heard all when in the car with me).  It's an uneasy feeling to know that not all Muranos are created the same.  I should be able to go from one to the other without telling the difference."
Nothing at this time
Interior design
sleek design
The 2016 Murano is lower to the ground than my old Murano (2006).  Would like to see this model raised it little more off the ground.
"better fuel economy than my old Murano, seat warmers, blind spot warning, back up camera, nice leather interior, smooth drive, lots of bells and whistles still trying to figure out"
Vision is slightly hampered for driver by the passenger side view mirror.
Overall ride
Please make the installation of automatic safety response to an accident (ie:OnStar) available for our vehicle.
Appearance of exterior and comfort of back seats.
I have driven Nissan vehicles for many years. in spite of difficulty with bluetooth I am very pleased
new technology
"Truly exceptional, would not change a thing!"
The ride and the navigational system
Old maxima had power folding exterior mirror.  I really liked this one would have liked it on the new car
Comfortable. Love the cruse control
"Make heating / cooling more effective / efficient.  Give better acceleration at low RPM, and enable sport shift to provide more pick up / power when keeping in lower gear at higher speeds.  Make navigation address book entries / editing more straightforward.  When closing sun roof, don't have shade automatically close once roof completely shut."
"Hard to choose one thing - probably the look outside and inside ... great lines, great chrome accents, awesome wheels and 20"" tires, very sleek and sporty.  Also love the light design front and back.  And interior comfort and ride superb."
Would love 8 way passenger seat adjustment  Warning reminder when sunroof is open  Rear back up alarm sound.
Love the interior and exterior finishes  The technology/ entertainment system is overall excellent  Love the the adaptive cruise control and driver assist features  Really like the information dash board  Like height and placement of center console
Comfortable ride
would be nice if the seat belts had an option to keep it from sliding
Safety features
Love the interior.
"Need same adjustability in passenger seat as in drivers seat, 2007 had nice expandable interior door pockets, the 2016 pockets are useless, bring back two tier console not flimsy box sitting in console, my 2007 drove much better in traffic, but love the steering in 2016 model"
"Appearance is very stylish, paint has a glossy finish, chrome accents looks good, light interior color is very classy, steering is easy"
Interior space feels huge
Interior
One complaint. The center console is awkward to use. from the Lid to the little tray inside. Deep but can't reach into it without putting that tray somewhere else.  The Lid/armrest is cumbersome when trying to open or is open.
"Quite, smooth ride, but for the money, the Murano SL AWD could come with the foot assist technology. Call Ford they can help with that."
Our third Murano and are quite happy with our purchase.
"I really like the vehicle, only a few issues which I have previously stated.  It looks good and drives well.  I feel the steering reacts a little to much but I am sure I will get used to it.  My front seat rubbing the center console is my biggest problem, very frustrating.  The gas mileage is a little lower than I was expecting as well"
the ride and comfort
Seats cool in summer
Roominess and perks with vehicle
"I like the look, handling, seat comfort."
The vehicle is great. Technology is good but needs improvement
The new look and the space
"Some interior features still lacking quality feel. Sun visors, vanity mirror are standard at best.  Sunglasses storage is unusable (nobody has glasses to fit that compartment)!  I was under the impression the cargo screen came standard in the  platinum edition. Cargo area is adequate size but exposed. Huge disappointment to find I had to purchase the screen extra. (I have not made that purchase.).   Would like more small storage places like the ones on the outside of the console. Those are useful."
The exterior look is what drew me to this vehicle!  It is an adult car but it looks FUN!
The look and feel of the vehicle and the interior.
The ride.    Quiet and comfortable.  Blind spotlights
recall was scary
Theater seats in back
The look and feel
We LOVE this car.  I can't imagine anything you could do to it to make us love it more.
"Love all the safety features.  The 360 degree camera, the adaptive cruise control, etc.  If you have an accident in this car that's your fault you shouldn't have a license.  It makes us feel a whole lot better on the freeway or in parking lots."
"Road noise is worse than I anticipated. When starting off, it shifts gears too slowly. When I got the car home I noticed little whispy scratches on the front quarter panel. It doesn't get the gas mileage that I was hoping for. The a/c doesn't cool too well. Takes several minutes to start blowing cooler air. Doesn't cool enough."
The roominess.....the backup camera is much clearer than my Altima that I traded in.
Great vehicle would definitely buy another Murano!!!!
A little more horse power and torque
There are several blind spots   Better visibility through rear window
The look and the way it drives. Very smooth ride
interia
"the body style and color, roominess inside."

"Reduce rolling noise as experienced on the inside of the vehicle. Improve the CVT. I have experiences some jiddering at very low speeds on a uphill incline. Overall, the Murano is great, this is my third one and the 2016 is the best of the three. Good job to the engineers and designers."
"looks, power, storage, and the fun to drive factor."
It is a comfortable drive with all the features I need.
"Standard tri-climate control. Apple integrated hands free assist, like hyandai."
"The look! So much better than previous models, glad to see Nissan is starting to keep up with other brands"
"No complaints .....a slightly higher gas mileage would be good and that may increase as the vehicle gets ""relaxed"" via wear."
"Very smooth driving car with a  lot of ""pep""!"
Nothing.  It's perfect!
The seats are great!  The Blue Tooth is great!
"Quieter engine compartment and more solid sounding doors. Need more options such as-8 way pwr pass seat with lumbar, back up sensors, pwr folding mirrors, and rain sensing wipers."
"Styling, comfortable drivers seat, transmission (no shifting), navigation system, and speed sensitive cruise control."
I can't think of anything at the moment.
I like that it is a 6 cylinder vehicle and it is all wheel drive.
hesitation occurs while driving which seems to slow the pace while driving. Cabin could be more quiet
bold with attitude
Everything! Especially that it syncs with my phone and the intelligent cruise is awesome!!  I had the absolute best car buying experience from Greeley Nissan. Michael Green was outstanding! That is how buying a new car should be!
"The transmission is not what I'm used to. It seems to shift real hard, but I know the salesman mentioned that it's different. Maybe I've just got to get used to it??"
I would not change a thing. We loved our last Murano and look forward to keeping  this for a long while.
The overall look and performance.
"Nice, quiet ride and confortable interior"
Fuel economy is not as advertised. This is the one issue I have with the Murano.
Comfort and features.
front storage space is rather limited given the vehicle size.
"looks, comfort, performance"
Comfort
Nothing
Smooth riding and driving
N/A-  love my Murano.
"Rear gate lift options - ie, foot operated"
Ride
"Appearance,comfort,reliability, roominess,"
If you could please fix the paint chip. If there is a way to fix the messy touch up paint job that was done by the dealership  after fixing a dent in the left pillar. I would be happy to know that Nissan is willing to do the right thing.
That its a quite smooth  ride.
"The comfortable seats, redesign of exterior is very nice, drive and how it handles on the road, nav and bluetooth system"
"2 months after having the vehicle, an airbag recall notice was sent. The vehicle blind spot on the passenger side is something I've been putting up with."
Comfort and roominess
Improve some blind spots
Seat comfort
use better quality material on the doors. The plastic marks up/scratches very easily.  Fix Nissan Connect or start over - don't sell it if it doesn't work.  Add a bit more interior insulation to deaden the engine noise at higher RPMs.  Fix the seat height adjustment issues.
"Looks, Interior - Safety Features are TOP NOTCH - Well done !  Handles better than  previous Murano. The CVT in this version is superior to the older CVT's.  Good quality leather on the interior too !"
CVT transmission is not as smooth as my previous 2 Murano's
"Comfort, Style, Technology.  Adaptive cruise control.  Blind spot monitoring"
N/A @ present time
Comfortable seats & easy to drive
"Styling, technology offered and comfort."
"For all of the technology and advances on this car, I have to pull a lever to change position of the steering wheel and back seats have to be returned to upright position manually."
I love how it handles and the interior is gorgeous.
Still a large blind spot
Overall appearance
Comfortable ride
"Nothing than I can relate to.  I think the new Murano is just a great vehicle.  Pleasant ride, and has a lot of get up and go when needed."
"The ride, quietness and the technology of the vehicle.  Fairly easy to learn and then once learned very easy to operate.."
"Compared to my last Murano, the driver's side space is now narrower...I preferred the wider space.  While interior road noise is diminished compared to my last Murano, there is room for improvement, especially when compared with Volvo's, Mercedes, BMWs, etc."
"Comfortable, stable, but sporty."
Don't know.
EVERYTHING Else
Noise reduction for blue tooth
On board navigation  and dash board technology.
"Speedometer and tach light well during the day, but the information in the area between these two is difficult to see on a bright day...should be brighter and easier to see."
Good solid feel...exceptional quality...ambiance lighting a nice touch!
"All that, but can not turn radio station wheel on driver's wheel. It's only go to next station that already set,unless you use the radio dial. What a bum! did not know that when purchasing the car."
Comfortable
Overall really love this vehicle
Love the seats! Love the tec package and love the speed of the vehicle !! Overall it's outstanding
Very disappointed with all the black trim.  Bring down the fenders and get away from the trim.  Get back to the paint.  Down the run the car will keep its nice appearance in stead of faded out black plastic.  Until then will not buy another.
"I like the size and body shape.  Had my first one for 6 yrs and never had to have it serviced, except for my regular oil changes.  Hope my luck holds out.  Fingers crossed."
"The car drives sluggishly.  When having three points of contact w/ the tires when driving on a trail, the car wouldn't move.  We had to back up on a mountain to get the car to be able to move forward.  We are very disappointed in the all wheel drive capability.  When the car is put into park, the doors should automatically unlock.  The lumbar should be able to be adjusted up or down (height).  The voice command is disappointing.  It isn't as simple to use as my husband's Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Also, the headlights should come on automatically when using the wipers and rain sensing wipers would be an excellent enhancement."
I love the way it looks.  The cargo capacity is good.  It is very comfortable to drive.
"Vehicle is outstanding,,wife saw first time and fell in love with it.  Has taken it into work couple times, got good reviews and comments on the style of the car.  Thinking about upgrading to a 2016 instead of waiting for a 2017."
Body style and comfort..
safety features and the comfort
"The default for cabin air should be outside air rather than inside air recirculation.  I do not care for the plastic trim color under the top shelf of the dash. I would have preferred the color to be dark like the top of the dash.  I had to remove the back seat middle headrest, while not in use, for better rear view mirror sight."
"Overall, I am enjoying the car immensely and have received compliments on its styling."
"The design of the vehicle does not allow good visibility out the back and sides. Technology is good, but for safety, visibility out the back and sides should still be a priority."
"The interior and quiet, smooth ride."
"Ability to remotely start vehicle, automatic lift gate, comfort of heated seats (yes, I use the lumbar heat all the time even in heat)."
"When looking at side view mirrors you see a reflection of the silver surrounding the air conditioner vents.  Very, very distracting!!!!"
Looks
"Design, technology, and comfort."
Sales people should focus on teaching people how to use the features instead of talking about themselves.  Keep the conversation on the new car.
"Navigation, Safety features."
Nothing.
Everything
"Change to 6 speed transmission, make the driving experience more sporty.  Nissan's never seam to deliver the rated fuel economy."
Interior room/space.
Nothing at this time
Sporty feel and fun to drive
There seems to be a lot of reflection on the windshield when driving on a sunny day.  I can see the dashboard cover that goes over the instrument panel.  A little annoying.
The quietness of the ride and the comfort of the seats.  Drove it from FL to MA right after we purchased it and found it very comfortable.
Improve storage space. Also I would like to be able to open the sun roof partially without having to open the full sun coverage. Overall is an excellent car.
Smooth driving.
Better Bluetooth connectivity
Comfort
I like how quiet it is and also how comfortable it is.
We love our new vehicle so there really isn't anything we could add to improve it.
It's overall appearance.
Appearance and ease of technology
"Interior, seating, smooth ride, camera system all around vehicle"
Key less entry.
Safety features are outstanding!
"wished it got better gas mileage I use only name brand gas, Shell, Chervon, Exon, Marathon, Sunnco, could have more room in the big, do it a lot of comments on the body style and color and people wanting to know what brand it is"
like the body style and color and love the navigation and the weather radar do not like not being about to use my navigation while driving because you have to pull over and then punch in where you are needing to go very inconvenice
Put the mileage on the dash all the time.I can't find how to put it there Ruff ride in back seat.feel the road and bumps a lot
The looks
"Fix my phonebook, work on the tight steering."
The smooth ride.
"Not a fan of the location of the temp adjust.  It is what I reach for to hit the radio volume.  Not a fan of the steering wheel layout buttons.  I'd prefer radio on right, speed controls on left.  I'd like separate sun roof, roof screen buttons."
Looks.  I bought it because of how it looks.  Still very happy with that.
Color scheme of interior and exterior. Very quiet inside. Not a lot of outside noise.
My seats are above and beyond comfortable!  I love that I can go visit my kids without having to stop to fill up!    I also like the blind spot reminder lights!
Don't care for the no key needed to open or start car.
The chrome decor on the car and headlights.
Different loaner policy for defects covered by warranty. From a design standpoint: Sharper handling (less lean/squat/dive). Remove the black plastic at the bottom of the doors. Move the cup holders.
"Exterior design (except the front end which looks too much like a minivan), fuel mileage given the engine size and power. Features."
"just fix the head unit to include android auto / car play, more knee room between the door and center console, and more powerful engine options such as ~ 350 - 400hp would be nice. also the under-floor storage in the trunk should have a hinge on the side to make it easier to close in the dark"
"price for the amount of features, luxury level of materials"
If more road noise cancelation is possible?
Exterior sleek design & interior seat comfort.
Driving experance
Apple phones need to be more compatible.   I wished my drivers seat went up more.  I love my car.
fun to drive   comfortable
Nothing I love my Murano and would not change a thing about it.
The ride and comfort!
We have really enjoyed the vehicle other than these couple problems. It would be nice to see a little bit better quality speaker system in this vehicle and a little bit tougher seats.
We love the interior and hands free features.
Appearance and comfort.
"Better sound system,Woofer"
Everything except sound system
The stride in the front seats is to short
its a Nissan
The air conditioned seats are not as efficient as I had expected. Overall I am very happy with all aspects of the Murano. I do hope that in the future customers could pick and choose different features rather than having to upgrade to certain packages to get the ones you want. Paying for features you don't want to get the others you care about is somewhat frustrating as a consumer.
The interior
How it handles and I love being elevated on the road
To address and fix the autobrake issue I reported...
"Looks, handling, comfort"
Steering is a little sensitive.  A better feel of the road would be nice.
"Looks, comfort and quality.  Very smooth performance"
Fix the navigation system and the reflection issues.
It is great for long distance driving.
I can't think of any way my appreciation of my vehicle could be improved; it's a wonderful car that is a pleasure to own.
Everything.
"nothing, i love my new car"
everything! but i love the center console and the seating the most
The vehicle is done extremely well for the price and options that I chose!
"The ride is exceptional, the sound system is also exceptional."
"1-Needs a turbo for better performance. 2-Needs Power folding outside mirrors. 3-More steering wheel adjustment. 4-No need for CD's anymore. 5-Need side rearview cameras. 6-Too much ""Orange Peel"" in paint. 7-Needs a heated steering wheel."
Body style and Interior design.
AFTERT MY CAR BEING IN THE DEALERSHIP FOR 2 WEEKS ALL I WANT IS THE CAR TO FIXED AND BE SAFE TO DRIVE
THE RIDE
Blind spot warning light should be on outside mirror not inside
Quietness
Third Nissan had own .....
Murano is a pretty solid cross over.  I'm generally satisfied with the experience of owning a Nissan.
"Drivers seat, ride, technology enhanced safety features."
Nothing to offer. Everything good.
"Comfortable seating, very nice ride and new safety features for blind spot. Look the cameras."
safety features
"We love the car , this is the 3rd Nissan that we've owned . The 1st nissan was a 2009 Murano that i passed down to my son. The 2nd car was a Pathfinder because we needed a 3rd seat for when our grandkids travel with us. And Now we have the new 2016 Murano and only thing i am not happy with is the gas peddle is not like the old Murano .The 2009 Murano was very Peppy and like a rocket.This car accelerator peddle is like pushing a ton of bricks!!! You also need to have a better warranty like the KIA or HYUNDAI . Thank YOU very much , ps my father had a Datsun B210 around 1973 or 75 ."
"The new look , and more room ,comfort and safety !"
N/a
"New design, lower front end and interior"
interior
Storage or cubby holes are practically non existent or not convenient.  Center console compartment is chopped to allow a rear compartment which prevents the lid from being opened fully for driver access.
Beautiful looks and comfort.
I love my car.well done Nissan
the interior
Better antenna reception for radio.
Quietness of the car
The audio source and volume controls on the steering wheel are awkward to reach. Placing them higher on the steering wheel or locating them on the right side (where the cruise control is located) would make them more user friendly. An open storage area above the glove compartment would be a welcome addition for temporary storage of hand-held items...especially since the glove compartment is so huge.
"The driving comfort, the memory seats, the back-up and forward cameras with the 360 degree view, and the quality materials. Luxury without the high price tag."
The entire PACKAGAGE!
"I am pleased with my Murano and the only thing, I think, that could be improved is the gas mileage."
everything.
Blind Spot Warning
The blind spots are annoying.
"The ride, and responsiveness."
Would love to have a space near the gear shift similar to that of the 2014 Rogue. There isn't a convenient area to keep small items or lay a cell phone to charge.
I love to drive it.  It has a sporty feel yet solid like the 2011 Pathfinder I owned.
The Bluetooth voice quality and consistency of voice level changes at times during my conversations.  When I place the call on my headset those variations do not occur.
"The outside appearance and the handling on road, ease of parking, etc."
"Great vehicle.  I  have not driven the vehicle yet, my wife does and enjoys the Murano.  I have not driven the vehicle because I am in a wheel chair.  My wife takes me to the Veterans Hospital usually twice a week.  Valet parking personal at the VA Hospital really like our Murano, they comment on it every time.  It is so easy for my wife to load the wheel chair."
Because it is the best vehicle made
I would like it if the spare tire was located underneath the vehicle which would give more storage area in the back under the false floor.
"Comfort, backup camera"
The slanting roof on the interior vs. my 2010 Murano is poorly designed. Less storage vs. older design.
Styling and gas mileage
Nothing I love my car
Sporty
"Check engine light came on a couple days after purchase, after tested by Nissan, no future issues"
"The space, leg room, drives nice"
"Nothing , such a great vehicle !!!!"
"Driving man smooth ride , like riding on air !!!"
Too late for improving how I feel about the vehicle.  I like it.   I have already purchased it and there's nothing you can do about the poor design.  My husband says the vehicle hesitates when taking off from a dead stop sometimes.  I have not experienced this problem though.
I love the interior and sound system.
"Looks,comfort"
A little better on the fuel economy
The look and power
Better start up speed
"Turn signal camera would be nice, memory seating, I keep having to adjust my seat back to when my wife uses the car, push button door closure on trunk door, that should be standard,"
"The quiet cabin, comfortable seating, roominess, color"
"So far, pleased with purchase"
Looks
The cargo cover is a pain when loading vehicle.  The cover on our 2011 Murano was better.
Looks and performance.
very satisfied
performance
Find a way to get gas mileage to the advertised MPG or let me trade the vehicle for another model at no loss of my financial investment.
Vehicle exterior looks and driving comfort
the only think I do not like is being able to see the muffler or catalytic converter from the rear of the vehicle. A small panel under the rear bumper would hide it from view. It looks like something is hanging down too low.
"The ride, appearance and overall performance!"
It's perfect
"style, fuel economy, hi tech features, on and on"
Very pleased with everything
Sitting up higher in the seat versus a passenger car.
"The only complaint I have is the design of the side finders .... they are too high  on top side.  I have my seat set as high as is comfortable for me, but still have difficult seeing how close I'm getting to  the curve when making a right hand turn.  Except for that concern, I love my new Murano Nissan!  The Java color is simple ""beautiful""!"
"The classy ""look"" of the interior & exterior.  I choose the Java color with it's contrasting  interior color which I truly like.  The way the front seats go all the way down is most   comfortable for the passenger.  I am most pleased and would give the Murano a ""9+""  rating."
the perfect vehicle
"If you're going to charge so much for the vehicle, please make sure it's in proper working order."
It's comfortable for long road trips.
My interior is beautiful.  Rides great.
Great vehicles. My third Nissan
Standard technology
"Not a thing, truly am loving this vehicle after driving a Volvo 40 for 12 years"
"Everything, great vehicle"
Glare/reflection from the vent trim is in visual line with the side mirrors  Wind baffling when the windows are down
Quality and comfort
"This is my third Murano, and it took me a while to warm to the new styling. I'm very upset that within days of getting the vehicle there are several areas where it appears the paint is chipping. My last two Muranos were silver, this one is gun metal, so I don't know if that makes a difference in the paint. But I am less than pleased with the issues with the paint. Although the areas are small, I'm concerned about the current issues as well as what I'll see in the future if this continues. There are a couple of additional items I would ask NIssan to consider for future models. First is to add auto sensing windshield wipers and the Music box back into the vehicles - both features that I had in my 2012 Murano and miss greatly. Without these features I feel as if I went backward on my purchase somewhat. Another suggestion is to add in controls for the back seat heat/air so those in the back seat can control their comfort level. I do really enjoy my new Murano, but the paint issue and loss of a couple of my favorite features have made the purchase less than perfect."
It's a great vehicle - rides and handles nicely - and now that I've gotten used to the styling I really like the appearance.
You could make the payments for me.   Just kidding. It's a fine vehicle
The styling and the ease of getting in and out.
Quietness and comfort and gas mileage
The looks-interior and exterior
Better exterior paint choices and automatic rain sensing wipers.
Classy interior
"Offer free software fix so that we can use all features when traveling, most importantly the navigation system.   But it's also annoying that when the car is in reverse and I'm sitting in my driveway, I can't make a phone call or change the radio station.   Other improvements to the navigation system that I also find annoying  1. calculate the estimated time to arrival before I get going. Garmin GPS did this.   2. Offer the choice of how long to arrival and the estimated time to arrival.   Another improvement would be more visibility on the passenger side rear corner."
"Styling, reliability (we traded in a 2005 model), all the updated features, built-in bluetooth"
"the bose sound system is dull ,have to turn the volume almost all the way up to hear it,and there should be a pocket next to the drivers and passengers knees for a phone to fit,and for the top of the line the outside mirrors should power fold in when parked."
everything except what i mentioned.
"improve painting, pay attention to fuel door gaps"
"atractive, fun to ride"
Steering could be a little firmer
Comfort driving
Nothing really. I traded an Audi A7 for the Murano so there is a level of quality difference that is represented by the price differential.
Exterior styling and interior appointments.
"I have a problem with the distance that the headlights project, not very far. I have to use the brights more often than I think I should have to."
I love the looks of the Murano inside and out.
everything
back seats sit up to straight up and down. They need to tilt back more.
easy to get in and out of.
"I don't trust the car and asked my wife not to drive it until I can get it fixed. I don't trust the dealership I purchased this vehicle and I travel a lot. It would be great if someone contacted me, took the car to another dealership, got the fuel tank fixed to its original factory condition, replaced the exhaust with new parts, tested the car to make sure mpg is okay, and provided us a rental car so I don't use Uber to/from airport anymore."
"It is very stylish and looks great. I like the interior space, leg room and the luxury feeling. We got many looks on the road and compliments from people we don't know over the last few months."
Nothing. I like it!
All
The rear design catches too much dirt..leaving the tail gate and rear window dirty.  The seat belts are not easy to access for short drivers.  The compass would be better located on the rear view mirror. The exterior paint is a little thin.. already have two dings  from door bumps.  I love the warning lights when changing lanes if cars are in a blind spot.
It's new.
"I upgraded leather seats but they look cheap, not happy with them at all.  I thought the stereo would be better, my prior Ford Explorer had a better sound system.  For the money I paid for this car my seats should be nicer, and a better sound system should be in the car."
The outside appearance of the car is very pretty.
The trim around the air vents on dash are too reflective; creates reflection in the outside mirrors and blocks visibility. This definitely needs to be addressed.
"Quiet, stylish, technology"
Ability to add auto-collision braking feature without adding a moon-roof.  I wanted all the safety features and was not bothered by the price but was not able to add this front brake assistance package without a moon-roof.  Some people simply do not want a moor-roof especially in hot climates.  Thanks.
Very classy look to the Murano Platinum.  Interior is excellent (tan leather with black exterior)  Seats are much more comfortable than my Nissan Rogue's
"Get stains issues inside & out resolved.  I take pride in maintaining a nice vehicle and take very good care in keeping that way, especially when it's expensive."
"Drives smooth, quieter than most new vehicles of same type, comfortable seats& has loaded features comparable to and more than previous vehicle owned."
Interior trim molding is kinda ugly especially in white option.  Better fuel economy.
Looks very nice and rides smooth and feels very safe
Better fuel economy
Comfort. Luxury.
manuverability
better nav
Great ride!
Make it better so that minor things don't break during the break-in period
Great SUV. Did my homework and truly like it.
The riding is not as smooth and comfortable as a Kia. Trunk door is difficult to close..Need a strong person to pull the door down. No space to store little things.
I love it!
Sporty looking!
"The reclining strap on the second row seat, it looks cheap compairing the rest of the vehicle. The second row seatsshould recline more and the second row seat (the middle) belt should be easier to latch"
"The color, it's so easy to mantain it clean. The outside style. The control panel. I would love to have a sun roof but I couldn't afford the platinum model."
The seatbelt buckles move and are angled in a bit much. The drivers side will often dig into me and often needs adjusting. The blind spot created in the side view mirror area is larger than previous models.
Updated interior and rear passenger charging station.
Stronger windshield they shouldn't chip so easily with small rocks.
Exterior shape of the car and the interior detail.
Comfortable and quiet ride
fewer accessories than my last murano
It's my first SUV.  I love the extra room.
Add Android auto
"Smooth ride, safety features, roommines, confort."
I need to get front  passenger window fixed. I plan to bring it in when I bring the car in for my 5000 mile oil change.
Very comfortable ride. Good pickup.
intelligent cruise control
The design
Interior head room is the only thing that takes some time to get use to this is my forth murano and this model is a little tighter
The ride and handling
"Drives great , very quiet smooth ride"
"I chose the Nissan Murano because the seats were roomy and comfortable.  When I purchased the car it was mentioned to me that these were zero G seats.  It sounded great but now I see that the seats are narrow and not too comfortable.  I really wanted the wider, roomier seats.  This is my only disappointment."
I like the hi-tech details.
I have previously owned 2 Muranos and have always enjoyed the quality. I am enjoying my new Murano except for the problem with the seatbelt. This new car seems to sit lower to the ground than my 2009 Murano. At times I wish I had the 2009 back. I am hoping the 2016 performs as well as the 2009 in the snow come this winter.
"I am happy with the improved gas mileage and safety features. This is the first time I have had a navigation system and do enjoy its convenience.I am pleased with the looks, style and exterior paint. The Murano has been a great model in the Nissan line of cars."
Not much.
The quality.
I like the look of the vehicle. Very stylish.
"Leg room in the back seat.  My sister-in-law bought a Pathfinder and we bought the Murano, I believe that both of them are a little tight in leg room in the back seat.  It isn't anything that could be improved upon immediately but something that may be taken into consideration in future models."
"Sharp exterior design, rides very nice, exceptional video display and sitting up high while driving helps my wife feel more at ease."
The interior trim could be more luxurious. The wood grain in my previous Murano was changed to plastic trim.
"I like the heavy, secure handling. I also enjoy the sporty styling of the Murano."
The interior is luxurious. Still have line spots.
Under dash on the floor is very poorly done very disappointed.  Seat belt for center seat on rear hanging from roof I personally don't like.  Vehicle is only couple of months old front and rear bumper already has different color shade.
Looks inside and out very impressed love the improvement on materials use for inside and technology.
The cargo room could be made larger
"The style, comfort, spaciousness"
The vehicles lines are sharp and it is a very sporty car.  Much improved look than previous model of the Murano.  Gas mileage is good.
The overall cooling and heating does not have enough vents going to the back seat or the back part of the car.  There should be some vent in the overhead of the car like I had in my Buick Enclave.
The body style as well as the interior.  On the screen used for backing up or using any of the other information system needs to have a setup to keep the glare off so it can be seen.
more safety features like blind spot detection with rear cross traffic alert and lane change assist should be standard in the S model Murano
how quiet the interior is to outside noise and the navigation system
"I love my Murano. The only thing different that I would suggest is to upgrade the speakers/sound in the back of the Murano. We recently took the Murano on our first road trip and I rode in the back to check out the comfort (which was excellent) but noticed it was difficult to hear the radio without being turned up really load. Overall, I am pleased. with our purchase."
Definitely comfort and easy to drive.
I like how comfortable it is. Seats are large. Beautiful interior and exterior style.
the whole package
fix cut in carpet. check seat belt...is it the design
moonroof
"I love my new 2016 Murano, this is my 3rd. Only thing I have found is it lacks storage space compared to the recent versions.  My first had a deep console. My second had a less deeper but with 2 compartment and a storage in the rear seating area. This model is very attractive in appearance but lacks in size. It does have inside pockets under the seat but is a little inconvenient to access while driving. Overall I am very happy with my vehicle!!"
The look and the way it handles.  The technology is awesome still learning all the features it has.
I HAVE NO IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS.
THE APPEARANCE INSIDE AND OUT.
"Nothing, it is what it is."
The style and the fact that it is new.
"My city mileage is far below the EPA rating; should be equal or better since I drive in a manner that should maximize mileage. Seat belt bolts should not fall out. A simple assembly task, but with major importance. My grand daughter used the seat belt for which the bolt fell out."
"Style, inside and out. 360 view camera. Cooled seats. Good acceleration."
Easy to steel and manuave.
"The vehicle performs very well, am happy with my purchase,"
Overall cameras showing vehicle location.
"I love my Murano its my second Murano and it is even more exciting to drive.  Its beautiful I've gotten many compliments on my car.  I put it up there with the BMW, MERCEDES ECT."
The beautiful lines and drive
Standard power lift gate.
I like the appearance of the vehicle inside and out.
"Interior items like the dashboard, inside doors tend to scuff quite a bit...  not easily covered when cleaning"
pickup
Fuel economy is awful.
"The lumbar support can use a little more support than there actually is, and the navigation system can be a little more user friendly with also the phone programs."
"It's big and roomy, can seat a foursome very comfortably, also like the backup camera. I like the phonebook option and navigation, like the extra storage and usb ports, the 12 volt/120 volt outlet. There are a lot of amenities on and in the Murano that would be to much to list in this survey"
Nothing...  We love our Murano Platinum and everyone that sees it love it too....
"The Ride, Looks, the Ccabin and the Bose speakers.  There was a look of thought put into this car from the engineering people."
Is just right the way it is
Cutting edge appearance
Exterior design is beautiful.  Love driving it.
Would have liked for the sunroof and safety features like lane departure warning and front/rear parking sensors to be standard on all Platinum editions.
The size - height and length and roominess inside.
Doesn't get very good mileage in city driving...
The ride and the design
I wish there was sound for unbuckled seat belt.  There is a glare on drivers side off medal when it is bright that makes it difficult to see.  when windows are lowered it makes a very annoying sound that is only corrected with the windows lowed all the way.  there is a hesitation when the car shifts  as if the cruise control is on
this is my first vehicle in 15 years.  I have always brought a ford  I am still deciding
Nothing at this time. It seems to be great!
I am very pleased  with my new Murano.  I am still figuring out how to use all the extras that came on this vehicle.  It is a very nice SUV.  I love driving it.
The size of the vehicle is a perfect size.  I traded in my Pathfinder for this Murano and size wise it is very roomy and has all the extras that I need.  Gas mileage is very good.  I like the comfort and design of it.  The backup camera and Navigation system is very helpful for me.
"I would like the texting features to work through the car as important safety feature to avoid looking at phone, more and more people utilizing text messaging so increasingly important"
"Love the comfort, camera features are outstanding, overall, really enjoy the vehicle."
Nissan connect services available on the Murano.    More aggressive forward collision avoidance braking.
"Adaptive cruise, Moving Object Detection, All-around camera"
"how it drives, the comfort, while still looking stylish"
"Interior plastic and carpet looks cheap.  GPS is marginal--gas stations are not indicated as to where they are--in front or behind you!  The compass on the GPS is not good either. Wife likes compass on mirror--so she can see it.   Like the instrument panel compass but it doesn't work with GPS.  Tilt wheel doesn't tilt down enough.  The cruise control should have a setting to turn off the ""automatic"" feature.  The interior upholstery wasn't very good--had to have the dealer fix a wrinkle--still not perfect.  There's a plastic piece near my left calf when driving that rubs my leg--sticks out--uncomfortable--should be flush with the seat."
"Our third Murano.  Like the motor, transmission, seats, comfort, storage.  Wife especially like the heated rear seats!"
Classy car
Warranty recall for passenger seat airbag sensor.  Rattle in back end that may be related to one of the boxed up items beneath floor of storage compartment.  Scuff on exterior finish above left rear passenger door.  Also on front of vehicle.
"Very nice car overall.  Quite a step up from our '09 Murano.  Handles well, solid feeling.  Some nice new technology EX:auto adjustment of drivers seat by pushing one button.  A bit more road noise than I like."
Rigid seat belt connections could be longer.
Look
Nothing...I love it!
The technology
on our 2012 Murano it had rain sensing windshield wipers and this great feature was dropped on 2016?
Safety controls!
"There is excessive wind noise inside the cabin with all windows, doors and moon roof closed..  It is not as quiet has my 2011 Honda Accord.  Other than that it is a truly exception vehicle."
The styling and drive.
Wish the mileage was better.  Hope it improves in the future.
"The way Jr. Drives, safety features, good looks."
LOVE THE MURANO!!    LOTS OF COMPLIMRNTS FROM FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS & STRANGERS!!
CAMERA SYSTEM!! LOOKS!! ROOM ISN SEATS & CARGO AREA!!!    GREAT CAR!!
"More power! I love the looks, inside and out. But I am disappointed in the power.     My salesperson told me I had certain features, including rain sensing wipers and smart phone remote start. After much frustration trying to figure those out I returned to dealership to be told I don't have those.     We thought the Soundsystem just needed the settings changed, afterall, its the same Bose system my husband has in his car. Not the case, it's just got no sound quality.    Tires are not readily available. When traveling cross country on vacation we hit something in the road, causing the tire to be damaged beyond repair. No tire shop in Grants NM had one our size. Ok, it's a small town.  I called ahead to the Nissan dealerships in Albuquerque, they didn't have one either! 235 55 20. Thank god we didn't lose 2 tires like the guy in front of us.     I just reread the question. I would feel better if the sticky stuff on the paint were fixed and the black greasy stuff in the front window were fixed. I really would like to figure out a way to do the remote start on my phone. I don't know what could be done to fix the stereo and power issues. I would think they can do something to fix the headrests. I would love to have the Lane Departure feature for safety."
"The cruise control and emergency breaking. Navigation system is great. Interior cleans easily. Pearl white paint is gorgeous. Auto rear liftgate. Seat memory. Seashell interior. Headlights. Keyless system. Weather warnings, I think those are through sirus."
Interior
Better sound system especially for secondary seating. Better interior materials and quality workmanship / control.  Update the controls for secondary seat reclining from just a hard to reach /use loop.  More and easier to reach USB ports.
The exterior design is awesome and gorgeous. I love driving it. I love the turn radius. The acceleration is excellent. The smoothness of riding. I LOVE the blind spot indicator.
Safety
I love the way the car looks and the way it drives - I just need to be able to enjoy a quiet ride without the air blowing around causing a noisy ride!
Answered this question prior
Has there been any recall on the airbags?
Style
Just for the rattling interior noise to be fixed.
Appereance!
Love the new look of the car.  Would have liked to have wood trim vs the pearl color paneling but I still love this car.
leather and inside creature comforts!  Great Job!
Comfortable high tech
Do something about the customer service I have received from the Dealership on 104th in Northglenn Colorado.  I feel like they have lied to me and they NEVER call me with the information.  I always have to make the initial call and them MAYBE they will call me back.  I am VERY VERY FRUSTRATED.  They have had my car longer than I had it.  My case number with Nissan is #22856785 but contacting Nissan doesn't seem to have helped either so I'm not sure what I do next.
I could maybe answer this if I had my vehicle.  I don't remember much about it.
This meets all our needs and wants.
Heated and cooled seats plus the panoramic sun roof.
Less groan of transmission under load
Great ride and creature comforts.
More direct communication with your factory reps. No one at the dealership seems to care about us after the purchase.
"Cruise control, collision avoidance,voice communication with the vehicle."
Interior
Nothing! I love the car!
The overall styling!
"Back seat does not get adequate air conditioning, all vents are working just not enough ac power to cool the back which is vital here in AZ."
comfort of ride and convenience of all amenities.
Very Happy and Satisfied with my Murano
Sleek look
"The quality of accessories is below what they used to be in the original 2004 Murano. Cargo cover, steering wheel (used to be beautiful leather), are some of the examples"
Safety features
Fix the wind problem when the rear windows are open
Road noise needs damping
It's ind of silly but need to drive on dirt roads and the overhang above the tailgate seems to be a magnet for dirt accumulating on my rear windshield and the tailgate. I never had this issue with the Lexus RX300 i formerly owned.
Interior comfort and styling.
"Happy with new safety items, such as, lights to show when someone is in your blind spot.  Also, cruise control auto braking and return to selected speed."
These safety features.
Surprisingly good mileage
"the back seating should be a little larger, disappointed that I can not access text messages as I was told I could."
Love the drive and the feel of the vehicle
Apple car play
Style and comfort
Nothing at this time.
"Drive, interior, nav."
smooth transmission and precise handling
It appears they stole some foot room for the front seats compared to my 2013 Murano also the seats are nowhere as comfortable as my 2013 Murano was. If things do not change back I won't be leasing a new Murano when this lease is up.
I like the exterior very much
"the gas cap should have a holder so it is not hanging down when filling tank.  don't like so of interior are plastic pieces, like lighter"
"like the way it looks, and drives"
better gas mileage in city
ease of driving day to day
"I have been driving the Maxima since 2003. I was hoping the the power HP and the audio system of the Murano was equivalent to the Maxima. Also, at time the blue tooth system fade such that conversation become difficult. The sound must remain sharp.Check needs to be made to ensure that there is no leak in the exhaust system."
"The up to date  technology, the style, and the safety features."
"The only concern I have is with the windshield.  The day after I bought the SUV, I noticed a chip in the windshield.  When I took it back for the scratch coating service, I informed the service department and was told it would be fixed.  It was not."
Very comfortable and great sound system.
Maybe tighten up the steering a bit and make it sportier.  Overall it is an awesome vehicle
"seats, quietness, ride, looks, color"
There should be an indicator if you neglect to put on your safety belt
I love this car!
hatch liftgate very convenient
"Storage space, rides nice, beautiful interior, enjoying everything"
Better visibility from drivers seat to see the front right and left corners to avoid obstacles.
Automatic computer updates to the vehicle such as automatic parallel parking. Air-conditioned seats.
"The style, safety features, and entertainment system."
LOVE my Murano!
1.  Improve fuel mileage.   2.  Have the same seat adjustments on passenger seat as on the drivers seat.
"Comfort, smooth ride, handling, cameras, & appearance."
"Automatic rear door closing system would be a nice feature.  Side mirror indication of a vehicle beside you would also be a nice feature.  But we love the Murano. Much nicer than the previous Jeep we traded in, in terms of engine/transmission performance and overall vehicle performance."
Interior and seat adjustments.
very satisfied
comfort and appearance
You did not have a choice for other concerning the steering wheel.  There is sharp plastic edge where you hold the steering wheel in the center.  It is annoying to have to put duct tape on on a brand new car to avoid getting cut.  The plastic should be rounded.
Drive and appearance.
Lines are great to my taste.  It's get-up-and-go from dead stop is more than I expected.  Perfect engine size/power.  Electronics are unbelievable.  You have covered all the electronic aids I could imagine.  Radio (Bose) is terrific.    Obviously I am very satisfied!
"Going on 90, I turned in my BMW 750li (a terrific car) because I was having a   great deal of trouble getting in and out due to a leg injury from WW II which flared up due to my age and lack of activity to keep it in good order.  Looked at the Lexus and yours.  the Murano is better looking (my daughter-in-law owns one) and the only decernable differences were power and a much higher price.  A no brainer.."
"I was disappointed to learn that with the key that I was provided or any features within the vehicle, I was unable to open the tailgate without doing so manually."
The roominess and smooth ride of the vehicle.
I feel good about it already. Just a little loud while on Interstate
realiability
"I think there could be more usable space on the console, more usable space under the console and along the bottom of the door on the inside of the vehicle."
"This is the first suv i have had and I feel very comfortable driving it, it handles nicely and is comfortable."
Wide rims
Features
"comfort, handling, and ease of sight"
Feel good but too early to say more...
Handling and manuverabilty
takes a long time for air conditioning to cool down car - but it is Florida.
the handling of the vehicle is great
I can't think of anything at this point.
"Comfort, ease of entry (getting in and out of the car)"
Have my doors fixed. Also have someone explain why the passenger airbag light on the dash goes on and off with an adult sitting in that seat. This never did this until they reprogramed the system for the recall. When I ask the service manager he told me it's supposed to do this..I hope it's not off if we ever have a wreck!
I really like my vehicle. I know things happen and have to be fixed but I want it fixed correctly and not made to think I don't know what I'm talking about ( which they might of got away with if we had not test drove the exact same vehicle at another dealership). I'm just scared about having to have anything else serviced at this dealership. The Nissian is a great vehicle and the salesman we had was wonderful. But the service department not so great.
Passenger seat make same as drivers   Add android to radio
Overall quality & looks
I wish the seat warmers was better. They don't get that hot :(
The body style
air noise from side mirror.
ride
console too wide making discomfort of knee ...older model much more comfortable.  Passenger seat should be 8-way adjustable..sets much too low
Looks...gas milage
More USB ports to connect more devices
The renews. Height of the vehicle. The ride of the vehicle.
My vehicle is exactly I love it
It has a lot of space and u love the color
More sound insulation.
Engine and heated steering wheel.
I had a RAV4 before this car. The backseat could move forward to allow more storage in the back. I miss that terribly. I also don't like the storage arm rest. The arm rest doesn't go up 90 degrees and is harder to get to contents in the bottom of the storage compartment. Much preferred the arm rest storage in my 2011 RAV4.  So much easier to use.
It is VERY comfortable and very stylish.
"This is my forth Murano. I have always had black interior but wanted a change. I chose the tan but I'm not a huge fan of the ""seashell"" trim that comes along with it."
"I'm very loyal to Nissan and, particularly, the Murano. As stated, this is my forth Murano in a row. I really love it and hope to continue to be a Nissan customer for years to come."
"Sporty look, luxurious feel, comfortable ride."
"A few more HP- non-locking gas lid, key fob with lights to know if remote start actually worked-"
The seat comfort/ I drive a lot and feels great
I am very pleased with my Murano.  The only problem I have is that the seat is a little too low.  Would like it to adjust and be a little higher.
The size and the way it handles.
Telescoping steering wheel and color
No complaints.
Beautiful interior
"Styling, improved mileage from my previous vehicle."
Advance Backup alert systems.   Provide Apple Car and Android Car systems  Improve space to hold cell phones
"Interior, Sun roof. Transmission, driveability."
Toooooooooooooooo expensive for what you get in comparison to other cars that cost the same.
The only problem ive encountered is that at times the trunk doesnt fully close and needs to really be slammed hard to fully clise
Roominess and quiet ride. Love my Murano!!!
Style and roominess
"I have only had my 2016 Murano since May 5, 2016, currently, I am satisfied with the selection that I made.  The salesman, Jarvis Williams asked what main items were important for me to have in the vehicle and basically I received them"
"Gas mileage, color, how it handles on the road"
Overall I really like the vehicle!  The wind noise is a little bothersome and I probably need some additional instructs on navigation system to fully take advantage of its capabilities.
"Comfortable for a midsize vehicle considering I owned a 2008 Limited Highland, ( a little step down) good looking and good gas mileage.  Mike Surran was an exceptional sales person so knowledgeable and patient!!"
Everything!
It's an improvement over the last years model. Needs a better sound system with more technology features offered standard on all models. Technology is what sells the interior of your vehicle. Like Lane watch should be standard and blind spot indicators.
The Exterior appearance
Better gas milage
looks and smoothe ride
"When adaptive cruise reduces speed set point, notification of some sort would be nice"
overall its an outstanding vehicle.
"Next time someone calls and leaves a message,  plz call them back.  Also,  check you vehicles for damages before selling them.  If we drop 40k on a vehicle,  we expect it to be flawless and it was not.  At least you could call us back so you can make it right."
GREAT CAR SO FAR !!!1
None
Looks
Big step up from the Rogue I previously owned.  Love pretty much everything about the vehicle.  I would have liked having the opportunity to purchase the automatic emergency braking option.  Make it available as an option on vehicles besides the platinum edition.
Overall ride comfort
More interior  color choices.
The body style.
"when the vehicle hits a bump/small pothole, the system doesn't absorb the hit as good as a 42K vehicle should. The seat belt is attached too far back and not easy to access with left hand. The past Murano had more room and more towing weight and had class 3 hitch. GPS should use Garmin chips, easier to manage and enter address and map following. Transmission, when starting out is slow until you get to 40mph and not smooth. MY pathfinder had transmission issues and didn't get any help from Nissan and sold vehicle after one year. Bad PR on Nissan part, not fixing transmission and saying, nothing is wrong, which was not the case...and finally did admit issues with transmission."
"good looks and nice interior, except for seat belt and GPS chip, a nice vehicle on appearance, but not worth 42K. Less room than older Murano's and still has transmission issues."
Interior is very well done
Include safety zone sensor standard
Look and handling
Gas mileage!!!
Design! In and out.
"We love all the features and accessories, driveability and responsiveness.  Our only disappointment is in the paint.  It has a large amount of ""orange peel""  I expect a car that has Nissans reputation to have a superior paint job."
"Transmission smoothness.  We got this car because our new Jeep had serious  transmission problems.  It was our third Jeep, so we were very disappointed.  This is our second Murano."
"I live in a rural area. When I can get the vehicle to a dealership, I expect to have the issues resolved as fast as possible."
"I love the Murano and this is our second. I love the technology, looks, driving experience, and roominess."
"1) The light indicator on panel should be turned off immediately after the seat belt is unlocked. 2) Driver chair: Moving up/down should have many levels to create a comfort to driver. 3) Transmission: The vehicle should move forward quickly when 'D' is locked.  Now, it takes a little bite of time to move forward.  Rav4 moved forward quickly when the transmission handle at ""D""."
The vehicle is very nice inside and outside.  Driving is very smooth and quiet. The back-end camera is very helpful / great.  I love the back-end camera.
The front seat should be a little wider.
The looks.
Gas milage and the overall appearance
The placement of the center console makes it extremely difficult to access contents.      We love the vehicle but often cannot distinguish it from the Rogue.     The side view mirrors automatically tilt when in reverse and we find it extremely distracting - not at all useful to safely operating the vehicle.     The driver and passenger doors should all open when the car is turned off - not just the driver's door.
Everything!    Since you don't ask in the demographical portion of the survey - we are a mature gay couple living in Maine. Make sure your marketing is LGBT inclusive.
"Greater fuel economy.  Different material for interior of doors, elbow leaves impression on door just below window."

"* Include a quick guide to all the driving features, a short cheat book."

Seating comfort. Appearance
Could use a bit more room in the luggage area.
Quietness and comfort.
No comments
"honestly, i would like them to have a better AC system that cools down faster... it usually takes longer to cool down in comparison with other brands."
the exterior and interior is awesome... i loved the innovation and technology.
"1. Extend sensitivity of auto-headlights and navigation display mode change to night so that headlights come on later and navigation display (map) changes to night later.    2. Navigation system: when viewing the list of restaurants at an upcoming exit, for example, if you touch a particular name in the list, the NAV system automatically adds it as a waypoint in your current trip plan.  Suggest NAV allow the user to touch the name in order to display info (address, distance, etc) and have a button to ""add to route""."
Distance monitoring/management in cruise control.
"Change the trim on the AC vents to black,  the silver reflects in the side mirrors too much and depending on the time of the day can be distracting"
The ride and technology
very pleased--if it continues to do as well at 70000 we will definitely buy another
safety features plus plus wonderful ride --fuel econoy is a plus.  If we had not driven a platinum on a rental with our local dealer we would not have been impressed--the platinum edition is very nice. My wife drove a friends lexus--the murano platinum edition was much better per my wife

Have the salesperson spend more time going over the features.
"Rides well, great looking."

Nothing
Overall design and quietness of interior.
Smooth ride
"Purchased the exterior and interior sealing package.  When we received the vehicle, we were so excited we didn't realize the dash board was only 2/3 completed and there were other areas that were missed as well.  We have spoken to Nissan personnel on more than one occasion but have not yet been able to get the work completed.  Help with this would help us show off the vehicle with pride vs embarrassment.  A negative reflection on what has always been excellent work.  HELP!"
"We are very happy with our vehicle, except for the two items listed."
Overall look and interior design.
I would like to be able to voice text while driving.
Navigation the sound system and the over all  look and comfort of the vehicle.
"This is my 3rd murano. Bought first one in 2007, second in Dec 2015 which was totaled in April and then my third in may. I love this vehicle! The air bags did their job when someone turned in front of me and I really don't have any complaints except the problem I am having with the interior."
Everything! Lol but the birds eye view camera is the best feature I have ever seen on a vehicle
"It is a great automobile. I have had 4 Murano's now and have liked them all. Technology always causes me some frustration because more times than not it slows down a process rather than speeds it up. On this model it appears as if you have reduced the width of the vehicle and with that some of the storage on the side doors. to me the best storage on the side doors was in the 2004 Murano. and because of the loss of the width of the vehicle my rear storage area cover from my 2009 Murano will not work with my 2016. Overall it seems to be a rather comfortable and dependable vehicle. I will know more once I have driven it further. I buy a vehicle for the long haul, so dependability after the 100,000 mile mark is of key importance to me."
I like the styling. took a bit to get use too because i struggle with the wheels that came on it. i am into symmetrical design and the ones i have are the closest to symmetrical but still have a bit of off balance. I also like chrome or brushed aluminum. Everything seems for the most part to work well and is easy to use.
I love my new SUV
Every thing
used  nine in place  of ten as sometimes 10 does not always become ten but  one   that is way most of my nines are tens good car   have had nissans since 1973

The comfort of the seats and was easy to drive on vacation
I have no clue how to use the back seat middle safety belt.
"the look of it, inside and out"
"I had a Pathfinder before this so I lost room and still getting used to it.  I wish there was a little space for a phone or misc. small stuff instead of using the cup holders.  The sound system is great with the Bosse, however, when someone calls on the Bluetooth the volume varies quit a bit... It's either too loud or too soft.  I have played around with the controls, maybe I would read the book.  I do love the lights on the side to tell me there is someone in my blind spot."
I love the blind spot lights on the side of the car.  And of course love the Bosse system.  The sleek style of the vehicle is great too.
"I do love my new Nissan. These are a few things that would make it even better in my opinion: foot activated rear gate opening, brighter warning lights for cars approaching, lumbar comfort on rider side, better fuel economy, air conditioned seats, more cup holders."
"I enjoy the riding comfort, design, acceleration, memory for seat/mirror positioning, ability to use regular gas instead of high grade, and size of the vehicle."
If Apple IOS software would be 100% compatible with text and NissanConnect Apps.
Technology
"The digital instrument panel could show brighter, particularly during daylight driving."
I like the vehicle very much!  Lots of bang for the buck!
Back windshield is difficult to clean.  No fluid and roof overhang makes it difficult to clean back window in car wash.
"It is very stylized.  Looks great, nice lines.  Has the appearance of a smaller vehicle, yet is quite large.  Luxurious interior and great feel on the road.  Smooth and very little road noise even while traveling at high speeds."
Get better gas milage
Lots of room
"All went great, service excellent"
Style
"The warning sounds could be louder. In comparison to the Ford Edge that we previously owned, the warning sounds are quiet. If the radio was on, I don't if I  would hear the sound."
The comfort in the ride. The handling of the vehicle. I really like the car!
"I want my wind noise in my sunroof taken care of, I bought my car then nissan of muskogee just forgets about me. I've been in 4 times for my issue and called 4 times an no call back in 2 months. At this point I will never buy a nissan again. The paint color veriation has been pointed out to me by 4 people, it makes me sad!!"
"Its,such a gorgeous vehicle!! Drives like a dream! Love all the cool features just wish it had front sensors when parking."
I think a built in garage door opener should be standard.
"I like the look, the newness, and the bluetooth!"
None
Everything
So fvar very pleased
Seems very solid and easy to drive
that it look like a mecedes
"Nothing,  I am very pleased with purchase."
The smooth ride
"Improve turn radius , front storage compartments are so narrow that they don't hold much, need place to place take out containers, glove box is very narrow but nice and long."
"360 view, safety features, sleek looks, wheels"
"Homelink garage door opener directions for programming need to be more helpful. Very frustrated with that. Still haven't been able to program garage door opener and that's a basic need. Salesman didn't tell me that text messages weren't available through the Murano's technical support (hands-free cell phone is, but cannot view text messages). It's an option on the screen, but does not work with i-phone. So it's very misleading when you're test-driving!"
comfort
None
Comfortable
Improved gas mileage is always desireable
Safety features
I gave all 10's because I work custmer service as well and I know how important that 9 and 10 is but over all I would rank my service a 7 I'm grateful my vehicle was fixed under warranty but it took many trys and headache to get an appointment due to availability and I was told I would be lent a vehicle to use to run errands while my car was being worked on and when I got there that ended up not being the case.
Nothing except the small wind noise I mentioned.  Otherwise we love vehicle.   Wouldn't have bought it if we didn't.  Love it!
Technology is amazing   Need help figuring it all out   I'm of the older generation!
It could be less road sound. Very satisfied with my car.
"Quality of car, comfort, safety features, visual ability, driving and handle ability. Very happy with my car. It is me second Murano."
Looks
I cannot be in the shop for repairs and bought a new car somi would not have relpairs. Very disappointed i am havinv issues for the money i paid for the car
New and good looking
need morecovered  storage in rear compartment
the way it looks and how it drives so smoothly
style and power
"Rear seat belts do not fit children, it would be great to have the shoulder belts lowered to fit properly."
FUN TO DRIVE!!!
Add a back window that goes up and down at the touch of a button.  The ceiling closes when you close the panoramic moonroof/window.  They should be independent of each other.
"Happy with vehicle in general. Fuel Economy could be better, my 2009 is roomier and is a bit more fuel efficient"
fairly comfortable and attractive. Glad that Nissan finally came up with a good lease program
Resolve cell phone connection volume issue.

There seems to be an issue with the passenger seat air bag sensor.

No improvements to add at this time.
"Appearance, how the vehicle feels when driven, inside of the vehicle superior  quality of materials.  Electronics such as the  operational  function ability Of the GPS."
NOTHING I CAN THINK OF ...LOVE MY NEW MURANO!!!
"I wish it had better pick up, that satellite radio stays connected all the time, didn't have connectivity issues with phone/Bluetooth, better navigation system that allowed you to save addresses with names (the ability to just save addresses is not helpful as we don't often have addresses memorized), maps for navigation were better updated, and A/C works better."
"All the features it offers...when everything works as expected, the roominess/comfort of interior."
Keep working on gas economy around town.  Blue tooth for phone can have some noise issues and sound issues
"Handles well, has all the bells and whistles, and very comfortable"
Front seat side bolsters are not rigid enough.  They tend to deform and rub against center console when occupied.  Door over center console phone charging cubby feels flimsy.

The only thing to make this a better vehicle is to have a reduced price. :-)

Improve interior fit and finish. Paint quality could also be improved.
It rides well.
"Vehicle is great.  Still too new, no real issues at present."
Interior and driving ease.
"I traded a BMW M6 to purchase this car. I LOVE it!! I'm so happy I did.. Until now. The driver side tire/break system is making a loud noise occasionally when the breaks are applied. It happens randomly, no rhyme nor reason. With this happening now, and I haven't even made the 3rd car payment, it is making me second guess my decision. I feel I'm losing some trust in the vehicle and wondering/questioning its dependability.   Im not certain what to do now. I feel I shouldn't be having issues so early in the game."
"I like that the car drives smooth, has a smooth transmission and love the interior!!"
as you can see by my numbers that tells it all.
"the exterior and interior design, love the color and the ride"
"Safety - I have previously driven Volvos for close to 20 years and there is no boron steel to be found anywhere on the Murano for impact protection.  I do not feel as safe riding in the Murano as I did the Volvos.  However, the Murano is an Exceptional Vehicle in all other categories and I Greatly Enjoy Driving it."
Overall Appearance is Most Impressive!  Nissan Quality and Reliability are second to none!  Greatly Enjoy driving for it is very responsive!  Appreciate the forward radar sensor and auto-braking feature!
The only problem I have to get use to is using the screen up front to back up.  I'm use to looking over my right shoulder.  I can't do this in the Murano. Everything else is excellent with the vehicle.
It's roomy.
Fix whatever is wrong with my fuel problem
Everything but the fuel issue
A little better suspension for smoother ride on bumpy road
It's design and history of dependability
I am enjoying my 2016 Murano.  I have nothing to add at this point in time.
no comment
To me  the driver seat is not as roomy or as comfortable as my 2012 Murano was.
The outstanding body style.
The seats are very comfortable.
Navigation needs to be brought up to date at Nissan expense.
Safety features
Fix the volume issues with phone calls. Otherwise it's a great car.
Ease of navigation and air conditioned seats.
"Quality overall of package, safety features"
"Don't false advertise features that aren't avaliable, and the infotainment system needs allot of work."
"Looks, seats,  and ride comfort."
It's handling and acceleration. Also the safety braking.
Fix the audio / mapping / back up camera systems. My Sentra was awesome and had a great Bose sound system with great Nissan Connect apps.
How it looks.
No much it met my needs.  It could have had adjustments for the passenger seat like the drivers and the ability to have cooling in the seats as an option in more than the platinum.
"Comfort, ride, room, safety"
I really like my Murano
The seat belts rub on the leather seats near the door to produce a squeaky sound.
The exterior and the power of a 6 cylinder engine/fast acceleration.
I like everything about the Murano.
"I like its size, and the space inside."
Nothing
Handling
I noticed that the drivers side seat is surrounded by a frame that extends past the seat on the left side.  This continues to scratch my leg and is unsightly.  This piece should fit the seat exactly as the seat does not move from this piece.  Some of the pieces on the dash that should fit together have unnecessary space between them.  I had a 2010 Murano and it was twice the vehicle that this 2016 is.  The workmanship was much nicer and the vehicle handled better.
New technology.
Nothing! Love my car and the experience I had with my Nissan dealer!
"Technology, the way it drives, comfortable."
Very satisfied
I am completely satisfied with all aspects of my vehicle and the salesman has been exceptionally helpful.
"The safety features, the way it handles, the sporty look, the color, comfort, the roominess."
A little better gas mileage in the city would help. Open road gas mileage is great.
Excellent driving and handling.
"Repair the scratches because a vehicle should not get marks on it so easily.  Also, the sound system is not as loud as the 2008 model."
"Appearance, interior and safety features."
Interior is very stylish and controls are very intuitive.

"We loved the Murano when we first bought it, but then we started to experience one thing after another going bad with it and we are still dealing with it. Our Murano is still in the Dealer's Repair Shop."
It's appearance.
"Do not like the black interior, ridges on hood block view, side view, a flatter hood would allow you to improve vision relative to where the curb is when parking. We added a blind spot mirror on drivers side. The locking system on trunk does not seem to work all the time. The heating and cooling is not as good as it was on the Ford Escape, too slow. Seat was comfortable on a long trip. Our first Nissan, electronics seem hard for us to figure out but we read the book over and over. Simple is better or a voice response would be helpful. Our salesperson, Honeycutt explained things but it's too much to remember. My advise, keep it SIMPLE.we are elderly, need comfort, high priority, we tend to forget things. Overall we are enjoying the car."
"The ride and the comfort level, seats are good compared to other cars. Quite ride. Exterior paint seems great, repels dirt. Gas mileage is good. Electronics completed. Trunk lock a nightmare."
Change mirrors to take off the down tilt in reverse I hate it

"interior admenities, solid road wordiness, led headlights, navigation system, 8"" lcd display, all around a great improvement for 2016."

"The GPS is very poor, unacceptable performance and accessibility features.  I would suggest that someone go and buy a $99 dollar GPS at Walmart and then have your designer sit down and explain how the Nissan unit is better. (HINT:  it isn't) The Nissan unit is harder and less intuitive to program. The display resolution is lower, the display move feature is less responsive. Does it work, Yes But not as well as my cheap aftermarket unit."
"The seats, The AC, The mileage, The quality look and feel of the interior are excellent"
Style is very difficult to judge.  I didnot like it as we looked at other brands.  My wife was the opposite.   Now since the purchase our opinions have switched.  My wife really liked the exterior blue color on her previous Murano.
"Consistent quality and features included.  Price range was reasonable, yet we still looked at three other manufacturers.    Your salesman made the sale. (We have great service at this dealiership and we rated it as important as price)"
Should have plug for regular outlet.   More USB/plug outlet in the back  The base of the seat beat should be hiding inside the door frame so you can't step on it or you can't kick it
Exterior
"First of all I miss the overdrive button that I had on my 13 Murano, this provided the extra punch when I needed to pass.  The manual is something I really do not use. I have already mentioned the seats.  I feel all these vehicles should be awd now.  Interior lighting  at night could be improved. The text system is a good feature but should not be so complicated when a msg comes in."
I think the 16 is one of the best cars to date.  It handles the road better since I feel it is heavier;the technology package is good providing the driver with lots of information.  The interior is a great improvement on previous models especially the console area.  The looks the car are great and I get complements on it.
I'm really satisfied so far. Nothing to complain about.
"Interior space, quiet on the road."

More miles per gallon would be nice
I love the way it looks and I love all the bells and whistles
horrible fuel economy around town. Rattles in headrest drives me nuts.
Comfort is great. Beautiful car inside and out.
Include Lane Departure Warning in Technology Package as was on my 2013 Altima
"Luxurious seating comfort ,room, and Hi Tech safety features in Technology Package, AND Top Consumer Reports reliability rating and customer satisfaction."
"Would have liked this vehicle to be higher off the ground, more SUV-like.  Thought going from the 2013 Murano SL to the 2016 Murano SL would be bigger/higher off the ground... seems lower - more car-like....  that was my one comment for unattractiveness overall."

I like how easy the vehicle is to drive.
The only issue I see is when I drive with the windows down there is a whistle sound that I am not sure where it is coming from.
Hard to answer because I love everything about it so hard to say one item that i like most.
Nothing. I researched and test drove the car three times over 10 months. I was confident in my choice.
Many new cars have the features of the Murano but NONE look as good for the money. The exterior lines are what sold me. I love it so much I'd do a commercial for Nissan!
Nothing needs to improve. I love the vehicle.
I like everything about my new vehicle.
More room
Look
I wish I had noticed the paint difference on the hood sooner...I wouldn't have purchased the vehicle and certainly not in black.  Paint seems cheap and thin.  Should have purchased a vehicle with power seats...the adjustment handles seem cheap...poor quality.  Liftgate button is annoying.
The ride and the appearance minus the paint issues

just about everything
I liked the transmission in my 2010 and 2014 Muranos better than the transmission in the 2016
"Handling,  acceleration, comfort,"
Better carpet and floor mats in this model would be great. And it would be nice if the model came with the cover for the back hatch area.
"The zero-gravity seats are so comfortable for driving any distance.  It's not cold enough yet, but I am really looking forward to the heated seats."
"Graphic display and interface are well enhanced compared to the 2012 model year.  Also, the safety features including the surround view when vehicle is reversing.  The blind spot indicators, and other features including forward warning systems and the self adjusting speed sensor when using cruise control are amazing.  Safety air bag placement indicate lots of safety engineering involved."
Nothing at the moment
Style and interior layout
I love it.
there wasn't anything you could have done I'm very please
how well it handles all of the features
Many of the items that I have reported here I am not certain can be fixed or if that's just how the car is.
Lane warning lights and the 360 camera
The design of the hood scooped down toward the windshield cast a glare when the sun hits it.
Width and comfort of the front seats and the larger doors make it easier to get in the vehicle.
"Larger front seats. Not wide enough.  I am 6'2""  260 pounds, seats are the same size as my 07"
Exterior design and interior quietness.
Nissan Connect could have better maps (more rural info)
It is a stand out vehicle.  The exterior design and interior comfort

"Change the design of the driver seat, add more apps and make that Nissan connect easier to connect. I still don't know where the noise in my brakes is coming from, hopefully is not a mechanical problem."
The exterior look and the color of the interiors
I was very disappointed that the SV model did not have a power lift gate or back up sensors. There really is no point in having a back up camera with no back up sensors. Even my old 2006 Armada had back up sensors and it's 10 years old. There is no reason why a brand new car that isn't a base model shouldn't have them or a power lift gate. That was a huge disappointment for me.
The look. It's a very sharp looking car.
Everything!
I'm really happy with my MURANO
Make more technology features standard
"Appearance, comfort, and technology"
"When the sun is shining on the car in a certain angle, a bright glare that comes from the hood hits me straight in the eyes.  I don't know if being the car is the color white makes this more of an issue."
I enjoy the camera for pulling into spaces as well as for backing up.  Also the sensors for cars riding on either side of me.  One other feature is the car slows automatically when using the speed control feature.
We are very pleased with our Murano. We couldn't be happier.
Both the stylish interior and exterior
nothing
luxurious felling inside and outside
too many surveys
Nothing my nissan is great
Same as previous comment.
I definitely like the navigation system; I like that the directional arrows are displayed in front of the steering wheel.  The ride of the vehicle is very comfortable and smooth. I like that the body type is different from most other cars; one of the main reasons I chose it.
Awesome vehicle.. absolutely love it! The only thing would be more mpg but for a suv it is more than I could ask for.
"Room, appearance, quality of the vehicle"
comfortable vehicle for drivers and passengers and drives very smoothly.
The way it rides
I love the safety features.
"Improve the technology for the heated and cooled seats to push button.  Also, add a mute ""button"" on the dash in lieu of turning the volume knob.  In cases where you need to speak quickly to someone ""in person"" it would make it easier to quickly mute everything rather than using the volume control on the steering wheel and/or dash.  Buttons are always preferred.  Knobs seem like ""old"" technology."
360 camera
Fun to drive.
When we take it in for the 5000 mile oil change we will have them check the speakers out and see what needs to be done to give us enjoyment instead of aggravation.  If it remains the same then I will probably not buy another Murano nor recommend it like we did the Altima.
"The ride is comfortable, the overall appearance of the exterior is appealing."
Seat bottoms are a little soft  ... not holding up ...
Looks ... pickup  ( acceleration  ) ... and style
Exterior design and new interior design
1) I have seen that even after auto climate control is off and ac light is not turned on the cooling seems to be happening  2) The controls on the steering ( display audio phone etc ) can be better located   3) a person sitting behind the driver seat can step on the waist seat belt mechanism which is located under the driver seat. this causes tightening  of the waist belt seat on driver side. I have experienced it a more than a couple of time and is very discomforting
"interior, large display handling and engine power"
"I love my new car. The cooling seat option isn't really impactful.  It works fine but isn't really major noticeable difference.  The ""ashtray"" lid would be easier if on the other side as I use for loose change."
Overall confort
Nothing. It's a great car.
Interior cargo space
"Just to have the wind noise fixed. Also, I hear a little whine in the engine, but it's very possible that this is a normal noise."
"I absolutely love the exterior body style of my Murano. I feel it is by far the best looking SUV on the road. Also, the ride is very smooth, and it has amazing acceleration!"
The only thing that I would like is a hybrid model for fuel economy.
It is very comfortable.
Not much. Good car.
Exterior styling.
Reaching for seat belt.  To far back from driver seat.
still getting use to the car so hard to give a top rating
all good

quiet comfortable ride.
"I think the voice commands could use more work.  The phone calling commands don't work as well as I would like to see.  For example: when saying ""call dad"" the system comes back with (on the screen and voice)   1 dad   2 Frank  (voice) say or choose one.   Dad and Frank don't even sound the same, so I'm not sure as to why the system   would put those options on the screen."
Overall I think the interior is very nice. I like the color scheme very well.
There are a few features unclear how to use even with manuel

Great appearance in and out.  Rides great
The only thing is the navigation and the paring of blue tooth could be easier to operate.
"The look of it, the smoothness of the ride and cant forget gas mileage and the size. In other words it is a really sharp vehicle wouldn't trade for anything else."
"I see a lot of first and second generation Muranos on the road, so I always thought of it as a reliable vehicle for the long-haul. Mine (especially with the early shift-lever issue, which had my new car out-of-commission at the dealership for almost two weeks!) just doesn't instill that same level of confidence. It's a great drive, but many of the details don't feel as ""solid"" as I would have hoped."
It doesn't look like every other crossover on the road. It is MUCH easier to get my daughter's car seat and related items in and out of than was my Juke. The front seats are the most comfortable I can ever remember experiencing in a vehicle.
"Improve gas mileage;  automatic trunk open switch, unfastened seat belt sound indicator"
"The body style, color and lights; space in the back seat, the trunk and glove box; the # of cup holders, comfortable seats, the gas tank lock"
"The look of the vehicle, the interior of the vehicle and the smooth ride."
Everything
"Style, electronics, seating, safety features"
The exterior/interior appearance is so classy. This is what sold me on the vehicle. I love the new interior trim they have on the dash/door panels in the Murano's new body style. Looks very classy. And as a female this is what I like.
A bit more interior space would be nice.   I wish the moon roof was an option on its own.
"The look, the technology, the comfort of the seats!  I've received a lot of compliments on my Murano."
Nothing  I love my MURANO
"Good success this my second one, haven't had any trouble yet"
Nothing
"The road noise and the gas mileage probably is inherent to the car but it stresses me that I cannot check to see if the transmission is low on fluid, thus I know I will have problems in this area in the future. The transmission will probably go before any other part of the vehicle, sad."
"I like the car, but having to drive 60mls to check a fluid level is not an efficient use of my time."
I am short. It would be nice if the seats would go up higher. Still learning how to use.     Renewed the Sirius subscription. It was a lot more expensive then expected but it's needed to take advantage of our new Murano has to offer.
Still learning all it has to offer.
I will know more after my first service appointment.
"The exquisite appearance inside and out, the side camera that shows me how I am parking, the back up camera - everything actually, but most of all I love how it makes me feel when I drive it."
Nothing.In future models including fold away side mirrors would enhance the vehicle.
The ride and comfort
Yo creo q tiene todo lo adrcuado este Est muy hermoso
La tecnologa q tiene sus detectores para evitar un accidente
i like the look of it and that it is roomy on the inside.
Outside style. Inside comfort and technology.
while driving i notice that seating is low and makes it  difficult to see over rear view mirrors when making right and left turns. i am 6 feet tall and still have difficult time seeing over mirrors
"quiteness of the drive, smooth transmission, i feel safe, good fuel economy, exterior design"
"Interior look, and  comfy air conditioned seats"

seats
The murano has drastically improved since earlier models and I am very pleased with the new model and very happy that I chose to go with this model.
"The roominess, the technology is outstanding, and the quietness of the drive, I couldn't ask for a better vehicle."
"I love my Nissan Murano! I just wish it had better fuel economy. Also, it would be very helpful if someone at the dealership was very knowledgeable about the control panels (i.e. navigation options and features, Nissan Connect, etc.) and provided instructions on how to use these features."
The Murano provides a very comfortable ride from the way the vehicle handles the road to the way the seats feel. It has great safety features. I like the air conditioned front seats and the heated seats for all. I love the style both externally and internally.
"I was unable to add important features (safety lane-changing mirrors, power seats etc.) when I ordered this vehicle without either upgrading to a more expensive model or adding a package that contained various features that I did not want.  This is obviously a blatant marketing ploy to boost the price of the vehicle.  For myself, I am unwilling to engage in this charade, but it does leave me feeling very resentful toward Nissan."
Rear back-up camera
We LOVE this vehicle. Perhaps we would like better gas mileage. Right now we can't think of anything that needs improving
"I feel so special when I'm in it. It's safe, quiet and a joy to drive. The navi system and audio is very accessible and easy to use"
sun glare from silver lining in the interior is annoying an creates blinding effect at times
appearance and driving up high
I felt very uncomfortable having a new car have such a major repair within the first few months of owning.  It makes me wonder about the manufacturing quality and future safeness as well as repairs of car.
i like the ride..smooth and quiet.  i like the outside appearance.
I love the vehicle.  THe only thing I would like better is passing vehicle warning in the rear view mirror instead of the light on the inside of the car.  And the radio volume on the underside of the steering wheel.
air conditioner throws hot air when first started for longer period of time than my 13 murano.
The intell. cruise and the cameras.
nothing really i absolutely LOVE it and plan on getting another!
"COMFORT......quite, smooth drive....luxury feel.....roomy."
"2016 Nissan Murano side view mirror reflection    I purchased a 2016 Gun Metallic Murano S AWD on the evening of May 31, 2016.  The next day when driving it I noticed strong reflections of the metallic silver plastic accent piece around the AC vents on the side mirrors.  This presents a significant safety hazard.  So far the dealership is taking the position that they have never heard of this issue.  On 6/1/2016, I spoke to the service manager (Janice) who stated that she had never heard of this problem.  I checked online and there are numerous customer complaints about this problem.  There are also many complaints regarding  this exact same problem for the 2015 model year.  I am very disappointed with the Abeloff Nissan dealership in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.     On 6/1/2016 I asked Janice to check the Nissan Muranos in the dealerships lot for this problem, and she said she would check, she did not call me back.  I also called Brian Yates (the car salesman) and Ian (the financial person) and they did not call me back either."
smooth ride
Very pleased with car  but do feel that one needs a three hour course other then the day you buy the car because of the technical advances that I am experiencing and also one of the reasons I bought the car. Lat going on in what Nissan has developed and brought to the market.
"The ride, position above the regular traffic, the safety features . The interior and exterior of the overall package makes this Murano a great looking car. What is not to like!!!!!"
Nothing. I love this car.
The fact that it feels like I am driving a sports car with all the luxury of an SUV
"I love this car and it's my third Nissanand by far my favorite. My only complaint is that I could use another cup holder. The cup holder in the door isn't really large enough to hold anything other than a purchased bottle of water and I frequently have a reusable water bottle which doesn't fit. If there is no passenger it's not a problem but when traveling with a passenger there aren't enough. Also, the nearest dealership is about 40 miles away, although they told us they are opening one in our town but i haven't seen any signs of that yet."
I love the finishes and all of the technology advances. The intelligent cruise control is awesome and the car rides great and is fun to drive.
I love my new Murano.  Current concerns are minor.
The way it drives and how comfortable I feel in it
Nothing
The look the shape
everything
At this point nothing can be done to improve
The ride comfort of the vehicle and the way it handles on the open road
very pleased with our purchase.
there is nothing I don't like about our new Murano
"Tougher leather used on console, dash and doors.  More solid feel on visor materials.  A more forgiving color choice on interior (black) and exterior (white).  Navigation and sound features that are more intuitive and easier to navigate."
The beautiful lines on the exterior--the style.
The carpet in the interior seems cheap and not very durable. Wish you could adjust the passenger seat same as the drivers seat. Seats seems to sit low.
The outside of the vehicle has classy look. It rides very smooth and nice. The drivers seat sits very comfortable. Love my moonroof.
Pretty much exactly what I wanted .....no issues thus far...
Very comfortable to drive...great ride...quite....stereo sounds fantastic...pretty smart car on top of all that....
We love our new Murano!  So comfortable and a great ride.
Love the roominess of the interior and the very comfortable seats.
Appearance is sporty and practical

"I am a big guy, and if there could be more space for the driver's seat, that would be nice, but I know that would mean redesigning this vehicle again."
"That I am driving a Nissan again.  I had driven a car, which came out of my divorce, for 7 years, but not any longer."
Needed to have better mileage on a tank of gas.
Overall this is a well made vehicle. The glove box could have been a bit larger.
Just a little more left foot space on the driver's side would be great for us long legged drivers. Is the foot rest really necessary?
"I love its comfort on long trips, and the way it handle and responds to the driver's commannds."
Kinda wish I had got more extras like better speaker for the radio. Side cameras and remote lift gate.. But other than that love my new vehicle and the people at Nissan are super nice. I checked out other locations and Nissan beat them hands down.. Will refer people to you and my next car will be a Nissan.   Sincerely   LaDonna Boswell
"The way it handles, the back up camera, the seats are very comfortable... There is nothing I don't like about it"

the interior
"On one occasion, I used remote start, and when I arrived at the vehicle both driver and passenger windows were open, and the car had not started. Hmmm."
"It's a pleasure to drive, around town and long distance."
"The interior could stop falling apart, that would be great! The AC could be more powerful in the back seats"
The comfort and roominess
I like the smooth driving experience of my murano and I feel I'm driving on air.  I live my murano.

I wish it had the beeping warning when backing up rather than just the line to let you know when something is close. My husband has a frontier with the beeping.
Quiet ride and good air conditioning

"Love my Murano just the way it is, just wish I didn't have a payment (haha)"
"The way it handles, the comfort and gas mileage."
"I am not sure, but the car seems to be indicating 14 mpg, which is really low."
Seats
"This sounds very trivial, but you must understand I am still in the honeymoon phase. I love the way it looks, then drivability, then comfort, then roominess."
"I'm concerned over the safety when the ""no passenger"" indicator light stays on when a passenger is there!!!"

Comfort & appearance
Live my new murano
Technology
under the seat in the front passenger side there is a square cut into the carpet that the sales person said it looked as if they cut it to get to something under the seat. that is truly unexceptable for a brand new car and the price it cost. It is a eyesore and I feel as if something should have been done about it
"the ride is smooth. motor quietness, music, color(inside and out) gas mileage- city and highway, dashboard, comfort, roomy, tires,ease of access,curve gripper"
i love the design and the features offered in the vehicle
Give me a better deal or steal
Easier ability to adjust back seats
Clean exterior lines and very comfortable interior
New style of Murano. New paint colors. Love the new Pacific Sunset color.
"1.  Volume control goes from quiet to loud on phone when listening to phone calls  2.  Annoying hesitation when the vehicle slows right around 1,000 RPM"
How it looks
Pre set buttons for seating etc need to be lighted
Ease of getting in/out
"Overall we are very pleased with the car we like how it handles, we like the safety features. It's a great ride the gas mileage has been very good, if I had one thing that I would want different would be the passenger front seat I wish that you could adjust the height up and down not just back and forth"
"I think the safety features are probably what we like the most, with the warning signals for the blind spots to the automatic speed decrease when you are approaching a vehicle in front"
Not much.
"The seats.  I bought this vehicle because of the seats.  I have no back pain, even after a long drive, they are great!"
"The backup camera. There should be more sounds when getting close to an object, similar to what I had on my 2013 Pathfinder."
The style and comfort. It is beautiful.
Cooling and heated seats offered on packages. Self parking.
"Safety features, quiet ride, seat comfort"
I love just about everything! It was and is my dream car. The seats are extremely comfortable and the sound system superior. Easy to handle and very responsive. It's only been 2 months but I look forward to taking it on a long trip and to see how it handles in the snow.
My 2013 vehicle seemed to have roomier front seats.
"The computer that does gas mileage hard to use, should do most things automatically and doesn't.  I was told be dealer when I complained it isn't broken, just bad programming, not their problem.  BAD ATTITUDE"
The ride and seats
It's a really nice looking car. Drives great. Looking to see how it handles in the snow.
Nothing. I love this car!
The styling
Gas mileage
The looks
I would have thought that the Bose system would deliver better quality and the interior is not as quiet as my previous 2011 Murano.
Very good looking car with a very nice ride and overall appearance.

Need more interior 12v outlets. And placing the outlet directly in front of the cup holder is inconvenient as the plug gets in the way of drinks. A little more storage compartments in front would be nice as well.

"Since I've only had the vehicle for two months I think asking about the performance, etal. is a little premature.   At this point the only thing I would change is the wood trim in the vehicle.  It's a whitewash wood and I would have preferred a natural wood color.  Everything else has been exceptional ......so far."
"The interior soundproofing, the seats (outstanding), and the Bose soundsystem."
Fuel economy could be better
I like this Murano Platinum
Not satisfyed.dealer says they are not responsible for the usb door brackage !....it is a faulty design & faulty matarial usage in this part.
Not that much....not satisfied at all.send an engineer to talk about it in person.
It would be nice to be able to raise the drivers seat more than is possible now. I shall be able to really get a feel for the auto at the end of September since I am taking a trip to Mississippi with family.
"Put lights in inside lock and unlock on door panel, also improve city gas mileage then you get a 10 on ever thing from me."
THE POWER AND COLOR!
Increase fuel mileage. Everything else is excellent
The comfort of everything
Improve the issues mentioned in this survey.  Update the nav system to include current info.  Redesign the cargo cover to allow it to fold back out of the way!
"The seats are my favorite thing - REALLY comfortable!  I like the styling as well, and that is offers quite a few safety features."
Just need to be able to take off work and get it in for service
Comfort and appearance
The only thing was to check rear window washer before letting the car off the lot.  Everything works great and I know it will always be fixed but the window washer should have been fixed correctly the first time I took it in with out noise.  I think the car is perfect in most ways but still am only getting 23 on highway instead of 27 miles to the gallon.
"It is a attractive, quiet, and smooth running vehicle."
Not much. I love it. Just let me have radio favorites that will include all sources. My Buick can do it. So I know Nissan can get it done.
Drive is smooth
Roomy and classy. I feel like a high class person when I drive it.
"Would have preferred to have an on board GPS, would consider having one installed if it were reasonably priced."
"The ride, power and control, the room and the visual perspective of my surroundings."
"The gas mileage could be better for an SUV its size.  The steering is very sensitive, making it easy to veer out of your lane with the slightest distraction."
The luxurious interior and electronic displays.
I think my old 2010 Nissan Murano is more powerful and quieter than the 2016.
Its attractiveness
Nothing. I love it!
The way it rides.
"We have been very happy with our Murano. We are amazed with the camera system every time we use it, and it very comfortable on the highway. The only thing I would do to improve the vehicle is to add a little more sound deadening."
Ease of ingress and egress.  Seat height is perfect.  It is also a very attractive vehicle.
"Don't send me any more surveys. This like the 3rd or 4th one plus a couple of phone calls,"
The heated seat & sun glass holder.
The look and electronics
Expected the backup camera to beep when u get too close to an object considering it has a full car camera view  murano platinum
Aerodynamic style
"Separate air-conditioning controls in the backseat, separate radio control volume backseat, better cupholders- cupholders in door at an angle spell things from cups that don't have sealed lids.  Larger and more storage inside the front and back seats/doors."
"Technology, interior quietness, fuel economy,  interior luxury, hopefully reliability of the engine.    I've only had it three months, so we'll see in five years."
Everything is great
Everthing
This is my 2nd Murano. Liked my first one and so far like this one.
"As much as we spent on the Murano, a bed liner included would have been great. Instead I spent nearly $200 dollars on a bed liner so my dog doesn't mess up the carpet. Way cheaper than buying it thru Nissan. Should have been included."
I love my Murano!
install a better suspension system and seal off where the spare tire is

Everything
Steering could be more firm - wanders a little.  Nothing else.
"Tech features are great, and ride comfort is quiet and secure."
"Gas efficiency could be improved, as well as creating a quieter interior."

Buy American made products going forward.  This car should have never been put in service with this issue.  All the feathers were never checked or this issue would have been detected
I would have liked to have purchased a new car that worked like a new car should
In bright sun light it is difficult to read much of the instrument panel and while using the outside mirror the reflection of the dash on the side window clouds the mirror view.

Vehicle was delivered with a burn mark on the paint from shipping this should have been seen and corrected prior to delivery. It caused an unnecessary visit to the body shop to be corrected and the loss of 2 days with the car.
"Great design, nice Nissan quality"
"There is a sharp edge that hurts your fingers while using the steering wheel.  You have to learn how to use the steering wheel differently to avoid it, or cut your fingers.  It's a big deal because you can't avoid the steering wheel in order to drive the car.  Otherwise, the car is great."
"The technology included in my package, and most of all, how sharp it looks."
when I go for service at 5000 I will have the ventiation air filter checked

"No changes- impressed with style, design and colors"
How the car handles
I am very pleased with this vehicle.  I only wish I could have been able to afford the limited edition with the additional features.
I down sized from the Pathfinder since my family had their own vehicles.  I like that I get a smaller vehicle but with enough room and storage that it has not been any kind of an adjustment to down size.
Just a solid good looking vehicle
Appearance handling and gas
Any vehicle can be improved. Adding standard AWS OR AWD would be good!
"Drivability, Interior comfort and exterior appeal!"
Ability to change radio stations from the steering wheel.
The exterior design and a quieter more smooth ride than the Honda's I have had.
nothing at present time
"Definitely would prefer an automatic trunk, I had it on my old murano, you could use the key or press a button.  This lift is difficult and doesn't always go on the first press.  When I received the car the windows were streaky and I have tried to wash them put still appears."
"I like the look, and it drives well"
would like the bumpers the same color as the rest of the car.  I know they are plastic but I have seen other cars with the same plastic bumpers and they match.
"I love the appearance, the style, the interior.  I really like this suv."
BETTER WRITTEN OWNERS MANUALS----WRITTEN FOR THE USER NOT THE ENGINEER
"COMFERT,APPEARENCE,REVERSE VIDEO"
very comfy
Like the look and how it drives.
"Safety features on cruise control and the side flashing lights, camera picture when backing up."
The space
Prefer more room and better quality radio.
Quiteness and sleek look.
"The only changes I would even consider making include:  1. Make the side posts narrower to allow better side visibility on the highway...although the yellow/orange light that comes on to alert me to vehicles next to me is becoming easier to use!  2. Somehow make the hood slope not so dramatic from inside the vehicle to make it easier to gauge where the front wheels are for turning purposes.  Otherwise, this car is perfect!!!!"
"Seats, comfort, design, controls - everything!"
It is very comfortable and fun to drive
So far I love everything about my 2016 Murano.   I have only had it since 6-15-16
The styling inside and out.
Completely satisfied. No improvements needed!!  Jay Dorman  at Dorsett on Terre Haute took the time to show the vehicle  to me. Kept in constant contact and follow up. Totally went above and beyond
Overall...it's hard to make a choice. I'm that extremely  satisfied. It has far out weighted all expectations!
Right now nothing everything is good
Everything about it
"all of the safety features, blind side alert, cruise controls etc"
Nothing other than cheaper payments!!  LOL
"Phone connectivity.  Looks, paint color, smooth ride, quality of tires, over all everything about it."
"I would like some of the controls to be more digital and less analog. Particularly, the head and air conditioning controls. Otherwise, I like it."
I like the additional features and functionality. The texting feature is pretty cool. I also like the cooled seats/heated seats.
the cup holders make it difficult to utilize the controls for the heat/air and seats.   also would like to see 2 additional cup holders in the front seat do that driver and passenger each have access to 2 cup holders each.
ventilated seats
I would like for the salesman to rectify the problem with the storage cover for my vehicle.
It's new. I had a Murano before.
For such a small suv I feel the mpg could be much better
Inside and Outside are Beautiful
"Mostly the noise level in the car during rain. It's the noisiest vehicle I've ever owned. I'm so disappointed at this. I've owned Nissan in the past and never had this issue. I know exactly what the problem is, poor insulation, as I had to deal with this one other time when my car was wrecked and the body shop forgot to install the insulation in the door. They corrected it and the noise went away."
"For a SUV, it's very economical. It's very comfortable. It's very nice looking. It's a great vehicle for all occasions and needs. I really do like it."
This is an awesome car with a smooth ride. I wouldn't change anything.
"It looks good, the ride is awesome, and there is plenty of room."
appearance and technology
I have no issues with my murano!
I love how much space I have to transport things in ths back and I love the navigation system.
Everything
I have a wide bottom and would like a slightly wider seat. I have trouble reaching my seat adjustment when door is closed because I drive with the seat very close up.
"The looks  The new technology is one reason I traded in my 2014 Pathfinder, the lights showing the blind spot and the drivers info"
"I am totally satisfied with the vehicle itself.  On the other hand, I am not pleased with the dealer from which I purchased this car.  I am due a refund on a 2015 Rogue unused portion of the extended warranty. I have received no help in recovering this refund.  I have contacted the Nissan customer care at 1-800-647-7261 and am getting help, slowly from them. But, the dealership, that sold me another extended warranty on my new 2016 Murano, has not done anything to help in the recovery of my unused portion of the 2015 Rogue warranty.  This makes me dissatisfied with the dealer and Nissan.  Unless this is resolved soon, (the Murano was purchased in June, it is now September) I will not consider another Nissan automobile.  I love the car, but where is the company when it comes to something like this.  I have to talk to someone in the Phillipean Islands, who is hard to understand.  You have to do better that that.  The dealership is in Lufkin, Texas.  It is Loving Nissan."
The auto handles very well.  This is very important to me because my wife is the primary driver and she makes long trips regularly. I don't have to worry about her as much as before.
The gas mileage has truly been impressive. Very smooth ride
I love the comfort in seating as well as ease of getting in and out of vehicle.
Cooling seats should be standard when you live in Texas.
N/A
The way it drives and handle the road
"Smooth drive, sleek style"
I got the SV with cloth.  It looks a little cheap.  I would have preferred better looking material for a vehicle this nice.
The ride.
Better sound system.
Speed variable volume control.
it's a tie between the style and the smooth ride
"It had the best features which I wanted,"
"So far, so good!"
The interior is beautiful. I really enjoy the big screen.
Nisan Connect seems to be lacking in features.  I cannot seem to use it with my smart phone
seats are comfortable
Nothing really. It's easily the nicest car I've ever owned. Absolutely perfect for road trips.
"Styling (interior/exterior), ride, performance."
Driving range
The look and style
"I'd like if the outside mirrors could fold in with a button instead of manually.  It would be great if headrests had an adjustment for back and forth.  It's tough for women who wear clips or a ponytail then we have to sit with our necks to the side of the headrest or with head at an angle that isn't great for proper driving.  The back window needs to be made bigger or higher at the top in order to allow a better view of traffic behind the car.  You can see the car immediately behind but the window cuts off traffic that is farther behind (if there is even a little hill) so it doesn't allow me to get out of the way for a large truck for example until they are directly behind.  Ideally I'd like to make the decision sooner but if we cut see that far back, its difficult."
I like the large screen and blue and white color in the dash.  Seats are large and comfortable. The auto door lift for the rear hatch is super.  Overall space of the interior is amazing.  Drives smooth.
"Modern, good quality, good economic engine."
All is perfect.
It could be better back / side view.
Interior design.
Nothing
"Backup screen, passing car alert and blind spot alert"
nothing. I love my murano!!
Its beautiful.  Sleek and attractive
"Better quality control.  As mentioned, upon delivery, there was a minor paint flaw on the top which should have been detected upon inspection.  An additional item which hasn't been mentioned. Shortly after getting the vehicle, I heard a noise when pulling out of my garage that sounded like something hitting the floor. When I inspected the garage, I found a bolt ( with a torques head  ).  I showed this to the dealer and upon them inspecting the car, they informed me that it was from the driveshaft.  It appears the bolt as never completely screwed in.  These two items don't give me a good feeling regarding the quality control at Nissan."
"Although the seats are supposed to be one of the high points for the Murano, they still feel about a comfortable as the seats that I had in my 2004 Quest.  They are comfortable, but not over the top.  It has a solid ride, but I'm still not sure about the CVT trans.  At times it feels a bit quirky, and only time will tell regarding its life.  I take very good care of my cars, and even the recently sold 2004 Quest was almost like new.  I don't put extensive mileage on my cars since I work from home, therefore, I'm expecting to have this auto for a long time unless poor engineering comes into play ( again, seeing how the CVT holds up ).  I had no issues with my 2004 quest aside from me replacing defective cam angle sensors ( Quest had approx 85k miles ) prior to selling it. Since the Murano has the same engine, I am comfortable with that fact and also the fact that I know the engine quite well due to the Quest.  It's only the new CVT that is a concern as I know this was a big issue on earlier models of the Murano."
Nothing.....completely satisfied
The technology.....blind side warning my favorite
"Having owned  my Murano for just two months, I cannot offer any feedback for improvement because I haven't any...too new to comment. I surely hope there are no issues in the future to discourage me. I am a former Lexus buyer, and have found the Murano to exceed Lexus in overall luxury and pricing.  Murano is my very first Nissan purchase. Perhaps, you should send me another survey  in a year, if there may be problems, I can offer helpful feedback."
"The luxury feel, cabin space & quietness, overall driving experience, fuel economy...so far everything."
Not much. It is an excellent car. One thing it will make it better. Opening and closing the trunk door could be made using hand or body motion.
Everything. Roomy and very confortable inside.
Great car at a great price but the gps is limited by typing items etc however the Google app makes up for it. If I were Nissan I would dump traditional Gps and invest in more apps connective which provide gps and more on the great screen within the car
Blind spots warning and technology package and comfort of interior and exterior Good looks
Stop putting crap tires on it.  Use MICHELINS!!  The entertainment system/connectivity could have less props. touch screen would be nice.  Take a lesson from Toyota's system.
"appearance, handling, engine power, quiet cabin."
"Better a/c unit that cools quicker, a a/c plug that adapts to most plugs for phones, etc."
styling
Fix the CVT noise problem
overall appearamce.
The cover over the spare wheel could be a split cover for easier access to the space there. There isn't a lot of hidden storage space in the Murano so what storage there is it would be nice to get to it easier when there is stuff in the back that you may have back there all the time like winter survival kits that would have to be removed to open the lid to get to the storage around the spare tire.
That I don't have to climb into the vehicle or be pulled out of it. It is roomy and seats are very comfy. I haven't had it over a winter yet so I really can't say how it drives in bad weather but in good weather it has been great. I really like the anti collision bells and whistles.
So far I love it and can't think of anything I would change.
I like the new screen with the cameras the most.  Also like the digital   speedometer and the distance control with the car in front of you when the cruise control is on!
"Awesome vehicle, so glad to have it"
Looks great and has great performance
Exterior color.
I am very very satisfied
everything
THE blind side indicators should have been in the mirrors and not on the inside door panel.
Comfort and looks
"(1) The navigation panel is too low.  It should be redesigned to move upper for the safety concern.  So, this allows the driver not to look down but to focus up front.  (2) Both side windows in the back are too small to view approaching cars.  Even thought the car has blind spot detector, you will still want to peak back to be certain.  (3) When the car is in the lower speed, the blind spot detector does not work, which should be always working to detect approaching cars on both sides.  These are the three main drawback of Nissan Murano."
Yes
comfort
when riding at 50 miles the car wabbles from side to side
style and roomy
Pretty happy overall - wish hood fit better and bluetooth volume was not so annoying.  Forgot to mention the seat belt strap is somewhat hard to reach.
"Appearance, comfort, roominess"
have the problems corrected
the looks and the ride
"Think when you pay $40,000.00 for a new vehicle it should have the same adjustable seat as the driver.  Should not have to go to the top of the line for that option."
Safety feeling it provides to my wife.
make the electronic more user friendly--all Nissan drivers are not children (30yrs and under) who grew up playing with gadgets
its a reliable and comfortable vehicle
Larger gas tank? I fill up too often.
"SLeek, comfortable full of tech and safety features"
"Fix the Bluetooth or provide me a phone that is compatible since I was never told there are few compatible.  I bought a LG phone and use T-Mobile, there are only 2 T-Mobile compatible phones and they are not current OS.    Nissan/Dealer determined my Bluetooth is OK since service person connected his phone for 2 min to my Bluetooth.  The Bluetooth is TOTALLY unreliable and inconsistent.  Some days I can connect all trips all day, next time it never will connect, next time it connects and disconnects every 2-3 min, etc.  Your rep connecting for 1-2 min and saying it is OK with out running any diagnostics or other real test is lazy BS.    NEVER ANOTHER NISSAN OR AUTONATION VEHICLE FOR ME OR ANYONE/MANY I TELL OF MY EXPERIENCE.  I WILL DO ALL I CAN TO KILL YOUR SALES, INCLUDING HANGING A LARGE SIGN ON MY LEMON CAR!!!!!!!"
All but the Bluetooth and lack of support from Nissan & AutoNation.
"Headlamps, interior design, quietness of ride, height of ride, exterior appearance."
The driver's seat is not wide enough. The seat belt connector jabs into my hip. That does not happen when I sit in the front passenger seat.
"Height of vehicle, I can see oncoming traffic at corners. Fuel economy is good for a 6 cylinder car. Comfortable ride."
"One, the door swings out too far, I am 6'5"" and have long arms, hard for me to get it. The hood height is a little high not giving me the view I had on my 05 Murano. The Navigation could be better, I don't like that she tells me to make major freeway turns and gives me 1 mile to do so, I brought my old Garmin along and he gives me more time for turns. Also saving by name should be easier, it is very easy on the Garmin. Turning the fan down on the AC is complicated."
"Very roomy inside, like interior looks, nice engine for big tank."
"Admitting that I am short,I cannot judge the extreme front of the vehicle. This is due to the hood's design. It rises a few inches in front of the windshield prohibiting extreme frontal determination. I have pushed the driver's seat forward & upward to it's extreme to no avail. I was thinking of attaching a tall rigid wire to the front bumper area to assist my parking/braking judgement."
"I like all of the creature comforts & ""nav"" screen data available. It's truly superior in this area."
I am extremely happy with my Murano
Everything
"I just need to bring these issues to my first oil change to be resolved. Otherwise, I enjoy my Murano"
The technology and gas mileage is better than my old enclave
It rides smooth
Maybe more storage for things up front. Larger area for phone
The look inside and out. It drives like a dream. I drove lots of other cars but kept coming back to the murano. I do wish dealerships would wash and wipe down car after they work on it.
Some of the protection pieces on the rear door are loose. I have only had  vehicle for the months. I am going on vacation soon and I will have more knowledge by driving a longer distance.
So far the comfort of getting in and out and it seems very comfortable.
"Nothing, I am very pleased with my vehicle."
I like the way it handles and the comfortable ride  it provides.
Have power seats as standard in my vehicle
"The exterior appearance, the size of the screen inside"
"needed more in-service on using the ""whistles and bells"" i.e.  AC, signals,  Nissan connect features  driver seat belt is uncomfortable across breast--5'11"" frame with seat max back  and down.  Lane notification or radar front to back, side to side.  It's hard to place fenders in lane with care design  I still don't know if running AC correctly.  Still having trouble when rains."
"Smooth ride, Good take off, beautiful interior and exterior, feel like its reliable and  I'm safe."
I am very pleased with the vehicle.  I can not think of anything specifically that could have been improved at this time.
"The total package is very good, but likely the outside style and shape of the vehicle is most striking."
Cedric Beal was great in helping us get this point.  I see nothing that need improving.
The navigation is great!
Nothing
Comfort of the ride
Major problem with sun glare in driver's seat off the hood to the point I have had to put cardboard on lower portion of windshield to block sun reflection.  Also I won a 2011 Murano and this new model is not easy to see the end of the hood and very poor design for driver visibility when parking with a wall if front of the verhicle
Looks nice and drives well
Better place to keep phone while driving
Comfort
More interior storage space.  More power outlets
"Handling, comfort & appearance"
Overall somewhat satisfied with performance during summer. Winter weather usually is a better indicator though...time will tell.
"Instrument panel, backup camera, seat comfort, and entertainment center."
better gas mileage

Sometimes the gas pedal hesitates to kick in.  Not all the time but doesn't seem to accelerate at a steady even pace.
Love the interior and the ride
I totally love my Nissan Murano and I wouldn't change anything about it
Only issue is that I cant charge my phone when the vehicle is not running. That is a pain.
I wish the warning system for backing out would warn you sooner and louder.
I love the way it looks and the way it drives.

"No other suggestions.  Nice looking vehicle, plenty of room and decent fuel mileage.  Love the look and feel of driving this vehicle.  My wife has a 2013 Nissan Altima with similar (although cloth) seats.  Very comfortable ride on long trips.  Wish I could get the same mileage as she does... but she's not driving an SUV and I'm not driving a smaller car :)"
Look and sound system.  Bose rocks!
"Overall I am very happy with my vehicle. However, I do wish the cabin was as quiet as my previous vehicle, Buick Enclave."
"The surround camera, the roominess & comfort of the interior."
Leave opening for cord at plug in jacks.
"Style, comfort, technology, smooth and quiet engine."
"I love it, but I do wish it had better fuel economy & it lets in a little bit too much road noise, but it's cool.  You guys do need to figure out the design flaw on the mirrors though!"
It's gorgeous and comfortable!!
Great ride and comfort
I don't know the fix for my problems
"Roominess, features"
Why does the lights on the dashboard and touch screen dim when the headlights turn on and sometimes just auto dim?
"Appearance, roominess and blind spot lights notification."

REAR  SIDE BACK VIEW  NEEDS TO IMPROVE FOR DRIVER SAFETY.
RIDE AND HANDLING.
The interior is very luxurious
"If this vehicle achieved better gas mileage, I'd be in heaven. Fuel economy was a specific concern when considering this purchase. Possible improvements: Steering/handling could be a bit tighter and acceleration could be quicker/more powerful."
"Very comfortable ride/comfy seats (no amount of lumbar support is too much), spacious for passengers, interior and exterior appearance is clean and sharp. Smart, well constructed interior"
Better feel on take off.
Fuel efficient and appearance.
"remote start, gas mileage"
touchscreen on SL models.
Quiet drive
Give me  maps of Mexico and Canada.  Better antennae for satellite radio
Comfort and safety features
Since my wife drives the car - the largest complaint is that there is no cargo holder that is included within the price of the vehicle.  Since the car cost $45k one would think a standard cargo holder (like the older models) would be included.
The seats and comfortableness of the vehicle itself.  Great safety features!
Very nice
Seats
We are very happy with our Murano.  Keep up the good work!
Appearance and comfort
Could be roomier
Little bit better quality of sound system....but otherwise I love this vehicle
Comfort
Can send new emblems to fix it and i hope the the clicking in the front is fixed
Its a very nice ride
Doors are difficult to open. Trunk is very heavy and difficult to close.
Comfort
"Nissan Connect should have full functionality. Rattles are always an annoyance.  Gas mileage is not great, less than 27 on road. There is also one other problem that I have noticed. That is a glare off of the back edge of hood. Particularly in morning and afternoon the sun hits that are and almost blonds you. Could be a real problem."
We love the look of the white interior. The engine is adequate. Storage is good and right level. Like the air conditioned seats. Heated steering wheel option is great even in Vegas in winter. Nav system is adequate. Better examples are out there. Bluetooth phone works well. Glove box and other storage is great. Handles well in day to day driving.  Turn radius is a little large. In door storage is well laid out.
I feel this car little big and heavy different from the other muranos 2014
"Interiors, the color."
Cameras and sound
I have problems with air bags lights off and on
Comfortable and more save to drive it
We also had a cracked windshield within 2 months of ownership. This is my 3rd Nissan Murano.  I like the car but have not had as much problem with the other 2 so early after purchase.
"I love my murano, but there are two improvements I would make to bring the car up to Lexus standard:    1. Keep the general performance but improve in town gas mileage by at least 50%, and highway gas mileage by 25%.    2. The cabin is pretty quiet which was an absolute requirement for my SUV selection.  Even more insulation from road noise would be the real cherry on top!  I want to be able to have an easy conversation with rear seat passengers, even when driving over poor surfaces, and get out of the car after a journey without the slightest inkling of a headache caused by annoying transient noises    It is also too early to say if the the cars reliability puts it on a par with Lexus and some other Toyota brands.  My hope is that it will, and that it holds it's value over the years.  We shall see"
"Comfort, quiet cab, willing drive train, useful and surprisingly helpful technology."
"The side view mirror on both the driver and passenger side exhibits lines, from the reflection of the trim of the dashboard air vent.  It is very annoying."
I like the overall sleek look and the high - tech instrumentation.
Real visibility out of rear side windows.  Don't like just trusting that everything seen in cameras and mirrors is 100% accurate.
Very comfortable drive.
The passenger front seat should have extra positioning.    seat sits to low for some people. Should  be able to make it higher
Overall am very satisfied with the vehicle handling and all the features
"improve glove box, put more beverage holders, add clothing bar hook on both sides not just one, vehicle is high to get in and out of, change rug on rear deck to rubber, install release button for rear gate.  Small items but would be more enjoyable,"
"Style, comfort (once inside), ride, overall very satisfied."
Wish the area with the USB location would be bigger to store my phone.
Love the styling inside and out
Please fix the phone bluetooth connectivity issue and the annoying volume spikes.
Bigger gas tank
Seats
I would like a resolution to the bumpers being mismatched to the body of the vehicle. I have never had a new vehicle with this problem and for the cost I feel the paint should match.
The quiet ride and navigation system.
Everything
"the side mirrors have a terrible glare of reflection of inside the car vent trim annoying and distracting . the steering at high way speeds over 55 it seems to wander off to the right or left.passenger seat should have the same settings as the driver seat . USB connection is Very inconvenient in both places .need rain sensing wipers, auto dim headlights and much better headlights they are make hard to see at night the high beam is the only way to drive safely at night"
adaptive cruise and the NASA zero gravity seating the digital speed display
"Please correct the seat molding design on the drivers seat.  It is different than the 2015 and NOT an improvement.  My friend has the 2015 (as does your service manager) and we compared them.  I really like my new car, just disappointed having spent a substantial amount of money, to be experiencing problems 2 months after purchase.  Not my usual Nissan experience, and I've been brand loyal for many years."
"Love the ride, spaciousness, color, interior.  Very pleased with the engine and mileage."
"smart phone interface, remote access via app"
"styling, comfort, visibility"
I have the SV model. It would be very beneficial if the passenger seat could be raised and lowered like the drivers seat. Not all passengers are tall. My female passengers feel like they are down low.
It's appearance is striking both inside and out which helps to set it apart from other manufacturers.
Few more 'upscale' features ... auto wipers ... auto dimming high beams ... more apps for NissanConnect ...

Very roomy and fun to drive
"This is my third Murano,and 2016 version is a definite improvement from previous model. Its quieter,interior looks polished,love the part where it connects to my Android(spotify) effortlessly. Although there are many improvements from the look ,performance and technology i have noticed that the AC system doesn't cool the interior as quick as the previous model. I also suggest to include USB C type connection for fast charging. I have 3 kids ( age 7,4 and 8months) and its a struggle to have 2 boosters and a baby carrier."
"The technology -Bluetooth connection,camera -front and side,proximity sensing,saves last known seat adjustments to the key and remote start."
Nothing the wife has only driven it 1200 miles

Mpg not as high as advertised.  Just received a recall notice for the Anti lock brake system so will be inconvenienced while this is fixed
Comfortable ride and seats.  Plenty of pep and powerful engine.
"I like the look, the ride and everything else about the vehicle."
"I am actually very happy with the vehicle. I could come up with some improvements, but there really is not anything wrong."
I like the height. I like how comfortable the seats are. I like how it looks. It turns easily. The safety additions are fantastic. Fantastic.

Seat comfort
Fix the text to voice that was promised.
"There are several technology features available on other vehicles (many at lower prices) such as built-in Wi-Fi that could have been included in this vehicle considering the price. Our 2007 Murano had usable side door pockets; the center console had two separate compartments on top; to name a couple.  The changes on the new vehicle are not nearly as good.  The little things matter.      Also, fuel economy in city driving is well-below the ""advertised"" rate, although it is slightly better than the 2007."
"Comfort; passenger adjustable seat (the main reason why we bought the Murano instead of a Rogue or a competitor's vehicle); touch-technology; safety features (blind spot warning, additional cameras)"
Have the passenger seat go up and down
style and interior comfort
I would like the road noise to be considerable less. That would make driving the car darn near perfect.
The styling inside and outside.
Everything
The quiet ride.
Not a great deal of driver's storage compaetments.  I had a 2006 Murano and the interior felt much more spacious then the 2016.
The drive is smooth and I don't feel the CVT when climbing a hill.
Standard sound system could be improved.
The ride.
The operation of the seats are unacceptable. The continuously break after repairs
This is my second Murano and I love everything about it. But the seat problems are making me miss my 2013 Murano
"It would be good if it had a little storage compartment under the radio, in front of the gear box. at this point very satisfied with my purchase."
Very comfortable seats and the overall styling.

Too many good things to mention

Too early to tell .
"The technology safety features , comfortable seats"
"I absolutely love my Murano and am extremely happy with my purchase. My only complaint is trying to resolve a door ding (crease) on my driver's side. The process has been a hassle and no one takes responsibility for resolving it. It has been on my vehicle for a good 6 weeks now, a daily reminder. I feel I should be able to just bring it to the dealership, have it repaired and be done with it."
"Sporty and stylish on the exterior and luxurious on the interior.  It is quiet, roomy, lots of cargo space, drives nicely and packed with lots of features.  The panoramic sun/moon roof is also quiet when completely open.  I have had sunroofs in other vehicles that you can really hear wind resistance, but not in the Murano.  I truly love this vehicle."
Sound system
Handles nice
The advance cruise control and safety features.
satisfied
Nice ride.
Mirrors that fold in.
Interior and exterior design
"Improve exterior driving and parking visibility. I still don't know how close or how far away I am relative to traffic and parking. The driver exterior visibility is terrible and unsafe, Especially when exiting a parking lot, running over curbs,steep pavement at exit, etc. I'm 6' 4""  with good eye sight."
Nothing
I love the appearance
"Overall the vehicle has met or exceeded my expectations - but I consider ""Truly exceptional"" to be a superlative that is nearly unattainable goal, as it implies ""perfection.""  And in my opinion, there's never been a perfect car or a perfect house, etc.  So, if I rank something 9 out of 10, I consider that a very good mark."
Gas mileage
"Put Michelin Latitude tires on the vehicle.  Michelin Latitude tires come on the Chevrolet Equinox.  They are more quiet, speed rated and have longer wear warranty than the Toyo tires on my vehicle."
"The style, size performance and handling."
"Nothing, we love the vehicle."
"Love everything about it.  Has power, but has fuel economy.  It is comfortable and roomy. Classy style."
fix the right front hole in rug.  put the correct size mates all over car
"I had an 09 Murano that had a grocery organization system in the back and I think it should still be added to the vehicle, even as an option. It was very handy."
Driving comfort. It is a great long trip vehicle.
"I love the smooth ride of my new Murano, however, I really wanted the Platinum edition for the sunroof and cooled seats. Unfortunately, I would sacrifice the ride quality due to the 20"" rims and low profile tires. The 20"" rims and tire combination created a big difference on ride quality in my SL vs the Platinum. This should be an option for the car buyer on future models. Ride quality will win over more people than wheel looks/style in my opinion!!"
Ride quality and quietness.
"It handles well, but going over bumps is a problem. i wish it would not hit so hard.  It could use more cup holders. You can't use the holders in the back if there are three people seated. They have to hold their drinks.  Why not have some flip down holders to the side, at least."
"I like the style and the look. I like the lights and the double moon roof, I like the rims also. I like that is is easy to handle, drives smoothly."
Repair the holes dealership put in my new car.
New style
Not anything at the present time!
The handling of the car
I love the vehicle. Especially the technology. I previously owned a Highlander that I felt was too large for me. Like the size of Murano but I honestly think the Toyota is a better vehicle. Better built and heavier.
Technology and front seat interior
Voice to text does not work
We seem to have a rattle with the cargo cover  -   We love the car and everything about.    I know Nissan works better with a smartphone with reading text etc.  Why can't it work with an Iphone (without needing to be plugged in)?
The camera angles and I love a crossover
Leased it love it just needs to have a little more interior room especially the seats and some minor tweaking with the ability to see the ability to see home kink button at night and cruise control readability.
"Styling,gas mileage, and color."
I love my Murano!  It is perfect!
Everything!
Improve the trim piece that is at the bottom front left of the driver's seat.  The plastic edges are sharp and can cause scratching on your leg(s) when getting in or out of the vehicle.
The appearance...inside and out.
"it has less noise inside the car, the new body style and interior."
I feel the Murano is a great value for the money.
comfort on long trips
Lumbar for both front seats
Too much to list!!
"I really just need to make time to get it back into the shop and get it taken care of.  Since we are not used the all the tech stuff we really are not put out by it not working...but since we paid for a really sweet car, we should probably have a really sweet car."
"The beautiful lines, the smooth ride, quiet, solid exceptional ride."
give one free map update
style
I'm not sure.  We love the car.  Love the seats and interior.  Love the gas mileage and power.
Seats; interior appearance;  comfort.
Radio volume controls would be more convenient on the right side of the steering wheel.  Not enough small storage areas in driver passenger area.
Exterior and interior looks are very nice. Drive and ride comfort
I learned this week that my new Murano is in a recall.  That it may in fact have a fire potential.  Not real happy that I bought it right now.  I've changed trip plans because of it.
Exterior design.
"would be nice if nissan included a pindal pin for the front end of car,"
Like the vechile the technology and navigation are not what I was told they were. Hard to use. Can respond to txt messages. Navigation is horrible to use. Apps don't work!!
Nice interior looks great. Runs well
Expected the ride to be smoother since it was a cross over.
Look and the technology features
Fix body and bumper alignment. I had the same proublem with my 2013 Pathfinder.
Style and safety feachers
"The privacy screen at the rear is too low to get some items under.  Would be helpful to have that higher or just not installed.  Have not yet tried the remote start.  I know it did not work during the demo, but there was no offer to correct it before I took delivery and due to time, I did not think to ask."
"I love riding up higher and the view it gives, the general roominess, the ride and the overall look of the vehicle."
Most of my thoughts for improvement involve looking at the design of your vehicles for the future based on customer feedback such as this.
Very comfortable seats (however could use more lumbar).  Roominess of the front seat area and back seat area good.  Back seats are comfortable too!  The light indicators for vehicles in ones blindspots are great.
I like most everything about my 2016 Murano except lack of power back seats such as was in my 2014 Murano.
I only have had for 3500 miles but so far the car has been real good.
the smooth ride and the cuise control
"Met with the Service Manager and Sales Associate. Apparently, the vibration/noise issue at 1000 RPM is something that Nissan is aware of and is the result of attempting fuel efficiency. The Service Manager knew exactly this issue and was very upfront, honest. Nissan opted for better fuel economy but which results in vibration and noise when in Drive/Automatic. Switching to Manual resolves the issue but there shouldn't have to be an issue to resolve."
"Reliability, styling, spacious, practical in design; this was the only SUV/Crossover in which the seats fold down completely flat; easy to get in and out of, priced right, smooth ride."
Just the gas mileage.  I want to knock on wood I said so many good things.
So solid everywhere.
Better tech...
Style and design
"We have not had our vehicle long enough to notice any negative concerns.  We bought our Murano because we thought it was a pretty vehicle inside and out.  This is our first association with Nissan and look forward to a pleasant outcome.  We don't buy new things very often, this was a treat to ourselves!"
"The safety features, and the prettiness inside and out reflect quality."
Get me some nets and have them installed and rubber mat for trunk. The rest can't be fixed
How it handles and gas mileage. Also the appearance of the nissan
I have owned several vehicles in my 71 years and I was really impressed in my dealership. My daughter has bought 3 different vehicles from Bommaritos  and I regret not buying a vehicle from them sooner.  My sales man was very understanding answered all my questions and is always there if I need something relative to the operation of my new MURANO  I love my SUV  and my sales man Tyler Coleman .
I have never had a SUV and I'm very pleased with my car.  I love the color the size just everything is great. I am also impressed with my dealer ship and my sale man.
"Fix the issues. i was not pleased that I was told there was no fix for my bluetooth and it was just too bad. I expect if I pay extra for something, that it should work. I intend to pursue the issue."

We think the cup holders on the console could be side by side near the console and the compartment for the USB port moved up by the dash.
The ride and comfort of the seats. The navigation is great. The radio with the Bose speakers is great.
Automatic trunk closure
Cute interior and exterior
"I switched over to the Nissan Murano after 13 years and two 4Runners so I felt I was downsizing, but I have been pleased with the comfort and roominess of the Murano's interior.  I love the way it drives and handles on the highway.  It's a great car and I could not be more pleased with my choice.  There is nothing I would change about it other than a small item, being the small USB access compartment on the mid console.  You have to leave the small door open to use it which I don't like so I run my old coiled connector from the large console to charge my phone.  I find that small compartment pretty useless."
"The style, color, interior is rich looking and well made.  I wanted a sporty looking SUV and the Murano was the best out there in its class."
The interior feels luxurious. It is very comfortable.
I love my vehicle.  I wouldn't change a thing.
The camera to back up and pull in.  I love the beep when I'm too close to something.
Handling is great
Be able to see the complete hood.  Fortunately I have the cameras to help me determine how close I am when parking.
I really like the exterior design and the comfy seats.
The city mileage is considerable lower than the stated amount.  I drive with a very light foot.  A turbo option would be interesting as this car doesn't have a lot of 'pick-up'.
The seats; the air conditioner; the exterior.
Nothing. I love it!!

I just received a call from Sirus radio yesterday asking how I liked the Sirus and informing me I have until Sept. 20 to continue to enjoy this feature. No one ever told me about this ?
Its new and not falling apart.
"Better Bluetooth system. Otherwise I really love my new car, the interior is the BEST part --- the pearl like interior that is. (Cashmere)"
Cashmere Interior - so beautiful!
Would like a fully adjustable passenger seat. The dual air conditioning doesn't seem to really differentiate between the driver and passenger.
MY MURANO 2016 VEHICLE EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS
TECHNOLOGY
"Need to improve Rear storage by spare tire and an organization tray above tire covered by the cargo area! Loved it on my 2006.  Need to be able to monitor Tire pressure  from a stop position.  Need more control over the retracting moon roof. Need to have more space between floor and seat bottom so small tray can slide under seat, also access to under the back seat would be nice. Also, don't like they downgraded the towing! Didn't tow much more than a small trailer, but now can't even tow that"
"Styling design. Love the looks of interior pearled faux wood grain and curves, cashmere leather color with the charcoal carpet, exterior design has attitude! Handling is superb, holding final judgement until I've had winter driving"
Smooth ride.  Low road noise inside vehicle.  Comfortable seats.
Only issue is with blue tooth losing connection with phone.

We live in a technology era. The navigation system (to access apps and other features) seems like it was programmed about 12 years ago. Even the graphics are cheesey.

"For full disclosure to you, I have been driving a Lexus LS400 for the past 15 years and the handling and driving dynamics of a sedan vs. SUV are very different.  I wanted the ability to haul things and have AWD for mountain passes in winter, so I chose the Murano.  I did not have these desired qualities in the Lexus.  And I did not want to spend the amount of money for the luxury high end SUV to get those qualities.  I am happy with my new Murano and it fits my budget."
"The interior appointments, exterior appearance, media capabilities, and room to carry small loads in the back come to mind first.  Overall I am very pleased with this vehicle."
"some attention to the scratch and scuffing of interior and some exterior surfaces, the windshield glare problem and also some glare problems with some of the interior dash components"
"Appearance, sound quality, comfortable ride, safety features"
The Murano is awesome in terms of appearance and performance. The look is very elegant and very happy with it. The interior is stylish and leather seats look rich

More head room in cargo area
Comfort and handling
How big of a change this is over our old 2007 murano
I am disappointed with the MPG.  I get less than 15 mpg driving in the suburbs and on highways getting only 26.
It looks amazing...so sharp!  The quality of the interior is superb.
"The vehicle does have a smooth ride on good roads, but it does take bumps or potholes pretty rough."
"Looks, I really like the interior and exterior styling."
Lighting in the tailgate area is needed.  When it is dark outside the interior lights do not give off enough light.
The interior comfort
Get my part in so I will a fire due the ABS.  Better visibility out of the back.  Get rid of the slant where the front hood meets the windshield because of the glare that happens mid day.
"Handling, steering and the seats."
"The suppression of outside noise could be improved!!  With today's technology, the milage should be MUCH better."
Looks inside and out.   The seats are EXACTLY what we have been seeking due to my wife's bad back - they are perfect and one of the MAIN reasons we selected the Murano.  She can not use bucket seats.   The FLAT space when the back seats are down is great.
1. Ports in center console difficult to access - make them higher on inside wall  2. Road noise is an odd low sound... what is that?  3. Too much chrome on sides - the 'stripe' is a bit over the top for my simpler tastes
1. Seats are extremely comfortable  2. Fuel economy very good on trips for large/heavier vehicle  3. Tech package is terrific  4. Handles well
"It hugs the road and is fun to drive. Good, powerful engine for that size car. The main reason I wanted to try the Murano is to experience the CVT transmission. I like it so far (1,700 miles)."
"Wonderful, quiet ride and great gas mileage for the size and type of vehicle"""
Louder radio insidr
Body. Interior and roomy
Looks and handling
Service and recall process need to be reviewed. I expect better and quicker service and fixing on recall items is three months or more to get parts
Looks.   just wish the truck was a little bigger
none thank you Murano is a very good car
looks great rides nice
"I love the Nisan Murano 2016 !    It is perfect to drive long or short distances,everything makes feel comfortable.    Thank you so much!"
The new audio system
Passenger seat belt/air bag sensor recall just announced
"Appearance, comfort and ride"
parking brake could be better positioned to avoid scraping shin
very comfortable to drive
A specific place to put my purse without being in the seat or in the back seat.
"I like the way it drives, the quietness on the road and the comfort of the seats."
I have some trouble with the remote start feature. When I press the button the car doesn't always start. Not sure if it's me or the car.
"The interior and the features. Everything is easy to reach and navigate to on the screen. The Bluetooth quality is also fantastic. While on a call, my husband can hear our son clearly from the back seat  (the Bluetooth quality in my husbands infiniti is awful). The gas mileage is also great. The tank is not as big as a regular suv so I don't spend an arm and a leg on gas. The ride is also very smooth. Lastly, nothing beats a Bose sound system."
Think 2 or 3 of the system display views are repetitive or could be enhanced.
"Appearance, drivability, comfort, technology."
"Nothing much - only have 1700 miles on it, but everything has been great."
Styling; interior; and quietness on the road.
Do inspections on the car before delivery so you can workout minor repairs and/ or adjustment needed
"Handles very well, and it is a beautiful looking car"
seat belt latch release sometimes difficult. some lighting in that area at night would be a nice touch. still have to get use to technology but that will come in time.
overall  everything is liked.
Not much for me.
Safety Features
safety and comfort
"I really like the vehicle, many safety features that are not available on other similar priced vehicles. The 4 cameras are great!!  I think that by adding additional features like rain censors and land deviation would make it a great car better.      This is my first Nissan and I love it. Trade from a Honda Accord Hybred"
Like the 4 cameras and the view looking do while parking. and the styling
"1. Automatic dimming outside mirror, on driver side.  2. Automatic dimming headlights when in high beam mode.  3. Automatic rain-sensing windshield wipers."
Exterior and interior appearances and appointments.
"Should have back up sensors. Over all this is a very nice vehicle, this is my third Nissan, keep up the good work. I would like a solution to my Blue Tooth, problem this was not a issue on my first two Nissan's, I know how it should be. If I hear no further communication from from Nissan, because of this survey I will be convinced that this survey meant nothing and Nissan, does not care."
"The adaptive cruise control, it is so much fun to drive, it has so much power for a V6 and the CVT is very smooth."
If the car would beep when something is stationary it would be great.
Seats are very comfortable and the blind spot light is great. All cars should have them
Everything
Style of exterior. Comfort of seats.
We have had no problems.
The styling and interior are excellent and above our expectations.
Everything
"My prior vehicle was a Volvo XC90.  I miss the backup beep noise, which I don't have on my Murano."
The ride is nice.
Nissan Connect still needs some work.  Overal the car is great
The drive and space
"This is my first Murano, after having Cadillac SRX.  I think the vehicle is great.  my only disappointments are the quality of the speakers in the sound system & the plastic on the door panels.  The speakers seem mutted for some reason.  The black door panels seem to scuff too easily as you are exiting the vehicle & you hit the door panel with your shoe.  But I love my Murano!!!"
"the design, the chocolate leather interior,  The front seats are so comfortable. The technology is easy to use.  I just drove almost 2,000 miles last week thru some of the worst rain storms & I didn't feel beat up-  great ride & I felt safe.  It is a little bigger than my SRX & it is perfect"
(1) BETTER PAINT APPLICATION.   (2)BETTER OVERALL QUALITY CONTROL AFTER VEHICLE ASSEMBLY WHERE AUTOMOBILE IS MANUFACTURED.   (3) CURE FLAT SPOT ON ACCELLERATION FROM A STOP AND ON THE HIGHWAY WHEN PASSING.    (4) MORE LEG ROOM BEHIND FRONT SEATS.    (5) LARGER INTERIOR FRONT DOOR  POCKETS    (6) BRIGHTER INTERIOR LIGHTING FOR VANITY MIRRORS AND DOME           LIGHTING.     (7) CARGO COVER NEEDS A BETTER FINISHED EDGE AT REAR OF          COVER.    (8) HOOD NEEDS TO HAVE MORE OF AN OPENING WHEN FULLY          OPENED.    (9) EMBOSS VISCOSITY RECOMMENDED ON OIL FILL CAP.
"SMOOTH RIDE, COMFORTABLE, BETTER FUEL ECONOMY THAN      COMPARABLE CROSSOVER SUVS IN ITS CLASS.    STYLISH INTERIOR APPEARENCE."
Nothing
Gas mileage
"Mainly addressing the seating issues previously mentioned, but also the degree to which the design results in accumulating dirt on and around the tailgate."
"I like most everything else, but the GPS is less user friendly than I would like. Climate control, sound system, fuel economy, and overall driving experience are generally good to very good."
I would like for easier volume controls on the steering wheel now they are hard to reach also the sunglasses storage compartment is way to shallow to hold even the smallest of glasses.
The ease of stearing and comfort of the front seats. Also the overall looks.
Have dealer stop installing after market items to cars unless specifically requested by customer. It is an insult to customer adds cost to customer and often detracts from car
Good road car
I was hoping for better gas mileage but I only have 2500 miles on the Murano.  The cvt transmission is different. It will take some time to adjust.
"The color, dual temp, the heated and cooled seats, the dual seat adjustment, the adjustable back seat...pretty much everything! The automated cruise control needs some adjustment, though."
It should not take MONTHS for Nissan to ok the dealer to correct the paint and back hatch misalignment issues.
"Interior, exterior, and the excellent ride."
The dash lights could be without issues.
Roomy with great gas mileage.
More roominess in the drivers seat.  Not have the fluctuation in the voice volume when talking over the phone.
Style and gas milage
Keyless entry doesn't always work
Smooth lines.  Panaramic moon roof
"Improve pickup, especially from a stop. It is not as efficient as my previous Murano."
The appearance and feeling of being safe when driving.
I already love this vehicle. These are annoyances that irratate me. The bumps are the most annoying. I thought the larger tired would take care of that. The placement of the charging port is really annoying because I can't close the door. I don't think there are enough ports as well.
It's very comfortable and versatile
Don't put dummy plugs on the dashboard when I have ALL possible options. My 2014 was better laid out and had no extra switch plates.   What happened to the rain activated wipers?!!  Thanks for including a compass again.
"I've ""grown accustom to your face."" At first I didn't like the new exterior design. HOWEVER, I'm now a fan and wonder how I EVER drive a 2012 and 2014!"
"Not sure , I am taken it to the dealer"
"I'm not to hot on the Cruise Control tech package where you can set the vehicle to stop one, two, or three lengths behind a car in front of you. It can make high way driving goofey. I usually shut it off in traffic."
Comfort and driveabailty
There is a fabric lining that lines the inside wheel hub. Looks like fabric. My dealership had it replaced due to shrinkage. I was told that I might have to have it replaced again over the years due to weather conditions causes the shrinkage. Why didnt Nissan use a hard plastic or metal lining?
I love the combination of Sirius XM and Bose stereo. the plushness that comes with a platinum AWD. It drives like a Lexus
"Adjust the driver seat belt to be accessible , put outside temp in the driver display AND the nav screen.  Make passenger seat adjustment include up and down."
"Color, flashing of light or a beep, indicating a car or something is too close, seats are body hugging and very comfy. Nav screen is nice size."
It's fine
Looks great. Got a lot of compliments
"Space,quality,shape..."
". You should never put very light cloth seats in a vehicle. It would never stay clean. I paid to have leather put in.    Also, because the hood design faces downward, it is really difficult to tell where the front of the car is when parking. This has been my biggest concern"
Being able to pick up calls and talk to the car since I drive a lot. Also not having to dig keys out of my purse.
The look of it.
Audio - setting fade from front to back - where I would like it is between 2 settings and it does not sound quite right  Storage Pockets on back of front seats - to small (should be taller) and to tight  Glove box - shape eliminates a lot of storage availability
Mileage
None
The way it handles on road. Gas mileage is better than on previous Murano.l    .
The remote start was not set up friendly
The way it performs
"Would like knobs for heated seats in better place as hard to reach.  Also, have to remember to turn off heat/cool seats when shutting off vehicle."
good gas mileage
"the way it handles, very sporty, and very comfortable"
"Love it.  Just the right size, and love the interior."
The wood grain and leather interior.  That sold me!
bolster seats a little!
Hard to pick one thing.  Like almost everything about the vehicle.  I guess the improvement in gas mileage would be the best feature of the newer Murano.
Love the exterior design of the vehicle and the color. The ride is smooth and I love all the safe driving technology.
Better fuel mileage
Attention to details. Rides and handles well
"The info/entertainment tech system is buggy. There is a lag when I push buttons, it's not intuitive and it's just an overall poor setup. Also, it is absolutely ridiculous that this vehicle does not have full functionality of the nissan connect system."
interior
Elimination of road noise....this model is not really a quiet ride.
It's new.
"More storage, higher mpg"
smooth ride
Improve quality control at the factory.  Bubbles in paint and missing trim pieces are unacceptable.
"The smooth, quiet ride and the luxurious looking and feeling interior.  We saved over $10,000 versus the Lexus RX, but we don't feel like we made such a sacrifice in looks and feel."
Quieter cabin    Road noise
"Good gas mileage  sporty look, plenty of room, and good exceleration"
"Not much but we need paint fixed. We had a Quest, while it was too big for two seniors, we miss all the room and are having to relearn to live smaller."
"New, better mileage than Quest. More room in garage. Rides and drive very well."
Comfort
"Do you think the cargo cover would make a difference on the noise level, we had one in the 2009 version."
"everything, the one outstanding the most is the driver display with it's selection of information."
I will have to take it to the dealership where I purchased my murano. It's about 45 minutes from my home. I   Love my new murano. It's my 3rd one and I purched the platinum model. Beautiful. Just need to get the Bluetooth fixed.
I love it. It's my 3rd one.
nissan connect needs to be compatible with iPhones.
Make the sets like the one in the 2012 murano and a lil more height on the trunk door
The grey lying inside
fix phone problem
very comfortable.  adequate power
"Handling, and comfort, and engine response"
I would like to see automatic windshield wipers back on the vehicle as on my last one.
It continues to be a quality vehicle--it's my third purchase.  Like the range of travel on a tank of gas which is greater than my previous vehicle.
Be able to fix my problem.
Appearance.
The quietness of the cabin
The acceleration is not act very well
"style, comfort"
fix the Bluetooth problem
Everything else. It is a great car. It is my second Murano.
It could use even a little more acceleration.
Comfort and styling
THe appearance and electronics
Leather does not seem to be the quality one would expect at this price.  Door handle leather gets dirty easily and leather does not seem to be refined enough
"Looks, gas mileage, tech package"
intelligent speed control a little slow to react. My Ford fushion is much more responsive.
comfort of ride and safety features.
"The quality of the material used for  interior door panels needs to be improved.  My concern is that if the scuff marks were so easily made this early in the vehicle's life, when the vehicle is older the doors will look quite marked/scuffed and unattractive.  The quality of the seat material is excellent and very different from the door side panels."
"I like the style, the color and the roominess.  It handles beautifully and I enjoy driving it.  Many people comment on what a lovely car it is."
Nissan should improve the quality check. I face so many problems within three months Case # 23889902. 1) Fuel lid is not opening  2) hood replacement done due to bad configuration design  3) Wiper water is not spilling out after hood replacement  4)  USB driven audio  hangs the dashboard and sound after 20-30mins of play.  5) noice or vibration .     I totally upset with this vehicle. My trust on Nissan is subsided
"-This murano vehicle is good in  Design, interior , exterior, seats, dashboard navigation, apps, audio. adaptive cruse control, mileage."
Fix the paint issue. It looks like a clown's car with the multi colored bumpers
Comfort and style. This car is very comfortable on long trips!
"Nothing really, but it's disturbing that I all ready have a recall on my car with only 1000 miles on it and I have heard that it's a BIG concern with the ABS.. Just Worried!!"
The DRIVE!! very comfortable!!
It's luxurious.
Redesign the tailgate so that it opens to a higher position to accommodate the comfort of a taller person. I'd like a CD track skip button included on the steering wheel controls.
"It's attractive appearance, futuristic looks.  Luxurious interior. power and performance , smooth ride"
"The driver's seat often rubs against the console when moving into position unless I am perfectly centered in the seat, which is sometimes inconvenient given the position of the start switch and the position needed to engage the seat belt.  Also, I'm very disappointed that I can't get the HomeLink feature to work."
"It's beautiful, the gas mileage is pretty good, the a/c is excellent."
"The rear retractable storage cover vibrates when you go over bumps....the one in my last Rogue did not vibrate. My last Rogue had illuminated step to get into the car that said ""Rogue"" by my Murano doesn't and it's very helpful at night. The blind spot in front near the mirrors is a lot mor obstructed than my Rogue was."
I absolutely love the styling of the car ....it has  beautiful lines and gives you the impression that it's a really high priced vehicle.... and I love the all-around saftey features.
The cruise control and the feature where it keeps a safe distance from the vehicle in front.
Steering is a little sloppy! Can be tighter instead of the feeling that it's not as responsive
It's roomy and comfortable
I love my Murano and there's nothing I can really think of at this time to make it better.  There is always room for improvement but it's a fantastic vehicle and I love to drive it.
Can I say everything?
Nothing. I love it!
I like the wheels on my 2012 Murano platinum better than the wheels on my 2016.  And the paint choices  I thought were limited.
The reason I upgraded was the technology package. The safety features are    Very important to me.  Especially the blind spot detection which was not available on my 2012.
When using hands free telephone calls the volume of the caller's voice can be really unpredictable.  For example they are speaking and all of the sudden it becomes really loud and you have to constantly adjust the volume.  Just seems inconsistent and does not happen in other vehicles with hands free voice communications.
Appearance of interior and exterior.
"In many ways I love it.  I think it drives beautifully and looks beautiful as well. However I must say that the recall with the brake actuator frightened me and  although it has now been fixed,  thanks to my wonderful service people at Brenner Nissan, i still  feel vulnerable  wondering if there will be some other serious recalls that I'm not aware of at this time and if I'm going to be left on the side of the road in a very busy and unsafe area when I drive to New York and to Georgia.  I am not real happy with the seatbelt issue that I described earlier  When I mentioned about storage space  I find the pockets on the doors are very shallow and I can't keep items there as I was able to do on my 2005 Nissan quest .  I also enjoy and love how the car handles and am enjoying the many safety features. I love to tell people about forward emergency braking and hill assist and the way the cruise control works. I think it would be better if I took this survey in six months or more but I've only had the car for a little over two months."
"I'm sorry, I think I put many of these things in the last answer. As I mentioned there I love all the safety features. I love the looks and I love how the car handles. It's probably the last car I'm going to purchase and I'm very happy to be driving it in spite of the  issues that I mentioned before.  The service department at my dealer was wonderful and took appropriate and fast care of my car when the brake actuator situation, which was very dangerous and frightening, occurred. I told them and I will tell you the reason I bought another Nissan was because I knew the service department would take care of me when I needed it  I didn't think I would need them so soon but I did and they took care of the serious recall issue  quickly and efficiently."
Comfortable and reliable
Nothing
Interior & exterior appearance.
I would have Loved powered seats & a sun roof.
The ride & Style.
"Sharp edges on steering wheel plastic need to be fixed, nissan connect  only Google Apps work."
"Exterior design, Adaptive cruise control, cameras."
Please with vehicle but not pleased that there have been these initial problems.  I have owned 4 Nissans and not experienced initial problems in the past.  I also have a complaint that does not have so much to do with the car but with availability of parts.  Two of the repairs required replacement parts.  In both cases the parts had to be ordered requiring me to make 2 additional trips to have them installed.  This is a big inconvenience when part of the reason for going to a Nissan dealership is that they will have Nissan replacement parts in stock.
"Outside appearance, comfortable interior, strong engine."
Overall exterior and interior appearance
Mileage could be a lot better.
Comfort
I really do not know. I figured I was stuck with it.
Really can't narrow it down .
"firmer driver seats, better anti glare front windows.better faux or darker plastic on front"
"solid feeling , ext design and upgrade wheels"
Nothing
Everything  Handles wonderfully Get compliments on looks of vehicle  Love everything about it Wonderful choice and color
Improve quality of maintence and reduce the number of surveys sent out.
I have purchased three so I must like the car.  Do you keep tract of return customers and give any special treatment?
Offered more interior color options.
Handling of vehicle.  Steering is smooth and the turning radiance is great.
I simply love it.
comfort and size
recall on abs
The quality needs to be significantly improved. I have ran into way too many issues within the first couple of months of ownership and it's not acceptable on a brand new car. My steering wheel stopped working (!!!) which caused a lot of dangerous situations and could have easily lead to accidents and even fatalities. This is a major lawsuit waiting to happen. The dealership had no idea why it happened and couldn't explain why on a new car. I was excited to get my new Murano because it's beautiful on the outside and inside but the quality problems I've had has completely turned me off and this will be my first and last Nissan I purchase.
I like the looks of the vehicle both inside and outside.
The volume control switch on the steering wheel could be more intuitive/touch-friendly-right now it requires taking your eyes off the road which is dangerous
Overall feel-sleek and modern. LOVE the A-CVT
"Fix driver side door dings.  Otherwise, just love this car."
The interior.
The ABS recall was disappointing to find out less than 3 months of owning the car. Safety was the primary criteria for choosing a new vehicle.
its new
"It is the perfect size, not too big and not too small.  The gas mileage is excellent.  I just love it."
"Map,phone technology,"
"You can find a company that has a Navigation map system that is current. The Navigation is of no help when the route includes roads that are not in the system. It will show the roads on the screen, however, it will not give you any voice directions. I give the 2016 Nissan Murano Navigation a 0 rating! My husband and I have owned new Nissans since the 1980's and I have had issues before, however, I have NEVER had an issue that no one seems to be able to help solve."
I like the look and comfort of my 2016 Nissan Murano SL.
Heated steering wheel and indented shelf in back like in ROGUE.
Comfortable quiet ride. Appearance is beautiful.
Noise  counseling capability  Add auto braking   Add 6 disk cd changer
Appearance  safety features  and Storage
"There is no warning to fasten seat belts, just a lighted seat belt indicator. I think the car is very bumpy on a surface that is less than smooth."
I love the size and handling as well as the looks of the car.
You can do two things for us: Please give another new Murano due to the defects or reimburse us due to the defects.
i like everything; I just wished that it did not have defects.
Fix the steering pull to the left.  Reduced the road noise. More room
"Some of the technology, the exterior style"
I love it! I went from a G35 (infiniti) and I don't miss it. the murano is great. Only think I don't like is the exterior paint has chipped some.
the ride and tech package
The price and the gas mileage
Nice and lots of room.
FIX THE RECALL PROBLEM ASAP!!!
"Would be nice if the controls on the steering column were a different color - hard to see, especially for seniors not wearing glasses - lol, because they blend in on the steering column.  Also, it is hard to see the first button on the garage door opener at night.  The light that stays on located on the rear view mirror is to the right of the first button used to open garage door and can't be seen at night when reaching for it."
"The ride, comfort, looks, and quality of vehicle."
Overall look and feel when driving
"In addition to the front side window glare, the uniformity of trim lining up could be much better. Photos available if requested. Our 2010 Murano had better trim alignment probably due to the fact it was made in Japan. For his price vehicle we are disappointed with the quality leather used. Life cycle on the Black plastic trim on exterior is a question we have discussed after we noticed how much is in place."
"Style, Nissan experience with prior products owned, quietness and technology options."
Would like more back storage area and somewhere to set a purse when a passenger is present.  Don't like blind spots.
"Comfort, gas mileage."
I love the car.  I haven't had it for 3 months and received and email of a recall which is disappointing. I previously owned a 2006 Subaru Forrester and never had a recall!  My other disappointment is the air conditioned seats.  According to the manual you need to turn them off every time you shut down the car   for the motor to last.  I live in Fl. and find it very hard to remember and am afraid I'll be needing a new motor sooner than I would like.  One other thing - Texting is a little difficult.
"The looks, comfort  AWD and the info center with all of it's cameras, warning lights and sounds."
"sound of door closing. Locating position of right front corner for parking, cameras should not be necessary"
"Comfort and appearance , technology is very intuitive to operate--well done"
Wonderful Jesus! Gasoline mileage
Wonderful Jesus! Everything but the gas mileage
With only 2000 miles everything seems fine.
Features & looks
Bigger pockets on interior doors.  USB plug put on dash instead of in tiny compartment. Very hard to plug into.  I find the buttons on steering wheel are hard to find while driving. Too many where you can't see them.
I like the look and feel of the car.
Very pleased with the Murano.  I thought it was a very good value compared to suv s like acura and Lexus
The new intelligent cruise control and blind spot warning
Interior and exterior appeal. Great ride.Very comfortable seating.
Nothing
"Ride, size, quality"
Do not know of anything
"The comfort, smooth ride, convenience of controls, and that new car smell !!"
Seats need to be able to sit up higher. I had to buy 2 of those small blind spot mirrors.
The inside interior and the gps
"I had a smaller car that I did not have to fill up as often.  According to the readings, my Murano gets great mileage. I am really pleased with my car."
"Everything!  The looks, the spaciousness, the way it handles."
"Doors could be insulated better to alleviate the ""tin can"" sound on the outside when you shut them.  The hollow inside of the door sounds cheap instead of well built."
The ride is phenomenal and it drives like a dream!
nothing - love it!
Higher MPG.
The look and the features.
I love my new vehicle.  I can honestly say I don't have any suggestions at this time.
"Size, fuel economy , overall looks,"
It's great
Body style
I was surprised that there wasn't storage setup under the carpet in the back of the vehicle.  Other models we looked had something there.
I find myself watching the way the CVT performs.  For example the RPMs can be about 1000 for a stable speed of anything up to 48 mph.  I do like the smoothness of transmission transition compared to multiple gear changes.
The color of the interior should have been more color selections.
"The exterior look, very sleek and classic. love the chrome."
We absolutely love our vehicle. We have no complaints at all
I like the ride of the vehicle the most but I love everything about it. It's perfect for me
If the dealership would quit calling me every week id be more satisfied. The actual vehicle is great
"The ride. Smooth, quick, comfortable"
The nav system is not as user-friendly as the one in our 2013 Altima.
It's roomy and comfortable inside when taking road trips. The backup camera is very clear and the overhead camera is helpful when parking.
"Ride, appearance."
"I loved the 2010 Murano we drove for 6 years before we purchased this new 2016 Murano except for the transfer case problem we had in year 4.  The new Murano is even better so far.  It seems roomier with better visibility and storage space.  The improved gas mileage is also much appreciated.  The new driver safety technologies are also extremely beneficial features.  To date, I haven't been able to think of any improvements for this vehicle."
"Sorry, I just answered this in the previous question."
Expected Nissan had the CVT Transmission issues resolved.  Rear shock noise not acceptable for any make vehicle. Will discuss with dealer at first scheduled oil change.
"Look, feel, comfort, highway drive"
"We compared this car to a Lexus, and I know now that I bought the wrong car. This is not the Nissan vehicle I thought I purchased, and the service expertise has not added any value my owner experience."
The appearance
slightly lower the humps on the hood so you can see more of the front end.
Nothing I Love this car
I am completely satisified
The way it handles on the road
Expedite recall repairs  regarding brake fluid leak that could start fires.
The driving performance and overall design of the entire vehicle.
Excellent. Thank You!!
Overall Look and Feel. Pleasure to drive
overall handling
The only thing I don't like is the change to the music system and the cd's not being programmed into the music box. Besides that I really like the car.  Being an older adult i mastered that part of the car and I was really comfortable with the ease of using it.
"The new body style is really nice, the roominess inside is great. Those warning lights on the inside for vehicles on the sides of you is the real reason I got the car as I get older sometimes I might miss a car in my blind spot. That warning signal is great."
"Some additional storage cubbies for driver phones, glasses (eye) etc"
"Styling, hi way driving comfort and ease"
Comfortable & roomy seats and interior. Classy style. Smooth ride. Pretty quiet
Passenger seat fully auto as the drivers seat
I really love the sporty look and the comfortable ride. Also it is economical and nice acceleration.
I'd like to be able to connect my Samsung through USB.
Sharp styling. Love the rims. I also like the 360 degree camera.
"too hard to digest all instructions too many instructions made more so  by the phrase"" if so equipped""."
the ride and appearance.
"digital readout of speed, memory seats and how they work sets themselves for driver without pushing or holding any buttons. comfort of seats"
Seat belt height adjustment is awkward to reach from seated position and difficult to pull out release clamp.  Must twist your body and then pull out from ergonomically weak position.
Ease of ingress and egress.  Comfortable seating.  Quiet ride.  Luxurious feel and design.
The look
Exterior
"We bought a new car so that we would have a trouble free vehicle.  We were disappointed.  The Nissan Omaha service department was cooperative and did good work.  However, it is very busy, and it takes an inordinate amount of time to get an appointment ( at least a week, or even more).  This is especially hard to understand for a brand new vehicle."
Safety features.
The car is perfect for my needs.
It handles well.  It has the ride of a luxury car.  The style and color of my vehicle is perfect for me.
Love this car.
Overall appearance.
vehicle ride outstanding
I love the look of my Murano the best. It looks like an extremely expensive vehicle but is very affordable. What I love the most is that it has all the bells and whistles of a luxury class crossover but has a cheaper price today.
Love it the way it is!
Ride and seating are so comfortable
You need to put automatic wind shield wiper on all vehicle.
Cooled seats heated seats
I would appreciate it if Nissan could solve the vibration issue.
almost everything except the vibration problem and the quality of the sound system.
"It has some sway on the highway, wish the controls were easier to use.  Have difficulties trying to change stations or change volume from steering wheel,  Disappointed with fog lights as well.  Don't seem to work very well.  Hands free phone never picks the correct entry from the contact list.  Will be taking the vehicle in shortly to see about the defroster on next service visit."
The seats are amazing.
"while looking under the Murano from the rear there is a ""Rube Goldberg"" looking exhaust pipe with a protective cover that really draws everyone's eye to it.  It appears to be an after thought in design that should be redesigned so that the exhaust pipe is not seen."
The overall styling of the vehicle.
Like it real well
It roominess
Quality control checks at dealer.
Looks great interior and exterior
"When leasing vehicle, only talk to one person.  No back and forth that takes all day."
"size, smooth ride, cargo space"
Trim around drivers seat cuts into leg. There should be better quality if this kind of detail
"Performance, accessories, comfort, design"
"Side door storage areas are too small, and the small little area on the gear shift console is poorly designed. Having the USB connection in there is always in the way. The faux marble looking swirly trim on mine looks really cheap."
Handles well and drives smooth. I like the style and the look. I like the design on the front and the headlights.
"The MPG performance in city driving is poor.  I am a 'gentle' driver, and I can only coax about 15 MPG to 16 MPG, which is far less than the EPA rating for city driving."
"I most like the ride, the road manners, the space, and the 360-camera."
road noise is still prevalent even when the stereo is turned up
"the ease of use of the keyfob.  i don't have to worry about locking my vehicle, just press a button all done."
"Nothing, I love everything about the car"
The interior technology and all the safety features of the Platinum package
better air conditioning delivery to rear passengers
"Technology, seat comfort, fun to drive, stylish interior & exterior"
The dash board is too deep - and  Busy- would like have the speed of vehicle in large number on the dash - the buttons to operate the radio and the phone are big and I don't like like the way to change modes - it's not easy and I find myself looking at the larger screen instead of using hands free
The seats the sound system and the rise of the vehicle
That air condition is not as powerful as the SL model unless there is some dysfunction with the SV model I currently have. It's sluggish when hot outside.
"It handles nicely, is powerful, the interior is  comfortable and convenient, and it looks good."
Greater range of adjustment on driver seatbelt upper anchor. Adjustable lumbar support on RF passenger seat.
Seat comfort is really great in driver's seat.
"Overall, a huge improvement over our 2014 Murano.  The safety features are excellent.  One small (literally) area of improvement would be the sunglasses compartment which needs to be a bit deeper."
"Safety features, comfortable, power"
Not a thing. I love the space and smooth ride!  I am extremely pleased.
The smooth drive.
"I love that my murano is so sleek and sharp looking! It is also very comfortable,  we love the seats, it's like you are getting hugged by them."
It is very comfortable and looks amazing! Awesome to drive!!
The only issue I have had is every time I shut the car off it smells like antifreeze.  I do love the car and am very happy with it.
The interior features and comfort.
"work on getting the ""white"" paint to match better between to bumper and metal."
"the way it drives, rides and the all around camera."
"Better gas mileage.  The reflection of where the gear shift is can be distracting and it also gets very hot, maybe some kind of cover can be created."
how comfortable the seats are.
First fix the seat belt retraction.
"I pretty much love my new car.  Its comfortable and I enjoy driving it.. I would have liked a smaller car such as the Maxima but I need all wheel drive for the winters.  I do love all the features my new vehicle offered such as cameras, blind spot lights, heated and cooled seats."
A little more cargo space
Everything
I completely love my Murano!
We lived in Manhattan where we didn't own a car. It surpassed my expectations in every way after not having had a car for four years.
Fix the hands free voice issue.
Exterior styling.
Overall Technology and Appearance
no 12volt outlets in drivers area the work when ignition is off. Can't charge cell phone when off.
Mileage and comfort.
add ability to display posted speed limit in front of driver as it is posted on navigation screen
comfort and appearence
"Nothing much, pretty happy."
Its new and amazing.
Cooling faster
The looks
When I turn off the car there is a noise in the engine that continues for a few minutes after the car is turned off. The hood of the car feels really hot moments after the car is turned off.
The look of the car; both interior and exterior.
I wish I did not have to come in for an appointment to check the breaks after only a few thousand miles.  Also - not all the wrap was taken off from the exterior trim of the vehicle on the passenger side.  I did not notice until I got home with the car.
This is my third Murano - my only comment and wish is that the Murano came with a third road seat - otherwise I obviously love this car!
The exterior look is very similar to it's higher end competitive models
"Well having had my new car for only 12 weeks, it is exceptional...I really do love it....I'm still learning everything about it...reading the manual . I feel safe, its very comfortable,sound system is great, love the design of exterior and interior. Ask me in another year and I hope I give the same answers...I have a feeling I will!!"
comfort and the way it drives
the plastic bump looks cheep.  middle rear seat belt can be improved.
"strong power, good room for second row"
provide a bit more usable storage  in and around front driver and passenger area..  improve the variable speed transmission for more positive acceleration. I do like how smooth it is. Also provide highee capacity towing..
Attractive and nicely futuristic..
There isn't anything I can think of.
The interior most of all. The lines on the dash area and the confy seats.
Appearance and comfort
Fix the navigation system problems I described and provide a free update.
The interior quality and fuel economy for the car of this size.
"Roominess, smooth ride and classically designed interior."
ok
It is a great vehicle and am very happy with it----for the 3 months I have owned it.
Its handling and is a pleasure to drive.
rear view visibility is lmited; back yup camera is deceiving for images at moderate distance.
Everything
Great service
Handling and drivability
I am sure it was a great buy.
Everything
Sometimes my Murano's Bluetooth and my iPhone have issues connecting.
Its style
Everything
Line of vision looking to the rear bothers me.
"Style as far as its lines, crome, hub caps etc.  Quiet interior. Leather seats. Sound system."
Everything. Have been looking at this vehicle for a long time.
"Keep in mind I traded a 2015 Rouge that was fully loaded...  The only feature[s] that I would like to see as a ""standard"" option are the overall view of the vehicle when backing and parking & a better audible signal when the vehicle is getting to close to something... other than that the Morano is a great vehicle, I would recommend it to anyone."
The ride and power are very nice...
The look!   It's a piece of art!
"Nothing! I love my new murano so far! I've only had it two months though, never had any problems with my Nissans. This is my fifth Nissan !"
Everything
I love my new murano!
The look and the suspension when riding over bumps.
Very stylist
"gas millage should be improved.  Interior materials, specially the plastic laminates seem cheap."
"handles really well, seats are comfortable, safety features on the cruise control is really nice, the overall exterior design is one of the features that got us interested in this vehicle.   Also, the price range, Nissan managed to offer a product that include lots of luxury items that luxury cars offer a much higher prices.  Finally, the engine seems to be reliable and strong, but I am a young buyer to really tell much on this end."
"Steering wheel: a sharp edge exists where the silver plastic meets the durable part of the spoke -- uncomfortable feel.   Lane Drift Warning: I assumed the car had this feature and was truly disappointed after buying the car and learning that it didn't.   Rear seat belts: often get hung in the back seat folding down, or interferes with fold down process.  Driver's seat belt: hides between seat and car frame, so difficult to reach. Better if moved forward of seat, so I could easily grab it.  Communications Package: very poor that iPhone 6 not always compatible, such as replying to texts. Google app outright sucks -- poor excuse for a feature. Where is Facebook -- not yet rolled out!  Sirius Traffic: does such a terrible job with traffic jams that I use Garmon, stuck to my windshield -- that's how bad Sirius does with rerouting when a traffic jam appears.  Center Console: Why, on main setting, would you give me the station name instead of the artist/song name? When using NAV, I constantly turn map off to see artist name -- shouldn't have to do this.  Center Console: Why turn off the compass when the NAV is on? I often want to know the direction I'm heading, despite what the NAV says to do.  Roof Crossbars: cause a wind should that didn't exist before. Couldn't you develop a more aerodynamic product?"
"Great looks -- ""chiseled""!  Quite. Good sound system. Sophisticated feeling interior, with leather and silver.  Nice, tall center counsel with table-top -like function.   Big glove box. Big center counsel container. Decent storage room in doors.   Easy to access spare tire compartment, which means I can store flares, cables, flashlight, etc. there -- great compartment for extra storage, due to ease of accessibility.   Best feature: smart cruise control -- I've driven 6,000 miles in two months, and I use this feature all the time -- really saves on wear and tear (how tired I get) after long drives!"
I do not like the groove on the top of the console.. Your elbow slips into it and is uncomfortable
The smooth ride and the look of the outside appearance
It is easy to get Inot the vehicle and it slides the seat up for me after I start it....I am a short person.
the comfort
nissan connect is terrible/uselss app.      the keylink doesn't seem to do anything
"comfortable, easy to drive"
"Looks  Driver assist  Cameras for parking, both entering and exiting  Solid feel  Navigation system  Controls"
No scratches and all parts of car securely fastened.
The comfort and ride are excellent.
The cabin is too noisy. It was in previous model(2013) also. No improvement.
It meets all other expectations.
additional safety feature of lane drifting.
"size, quietness, and handling."
Add some insulation to dampen the road noise and engine noise
"The handling, braking and comfort of the seats are exceptional"
"Overall, I am very happy with my Murano. I believe that the items mentioned are very poorly thought out. Having a control that is used all the time well below and farther away than a control that is rarely used is just plain stupid as well as pointing warning lights away from the driver."
Quality and styling.
The tech features
Better mpg
"Overall I am very pleased with the Murano. I drove a Nissan Pathfinder for 10 years before purchasing the Murano, so its a little less in storage than I was used to, especially in the back. I do miss the space I had. I like the Nissan products which is why I came back to Nissan. The Murano drives like a dream. I like the gas mileage. I do wish the maps were updated and I wish old text messages didn't pop up on my screen when I'm getting a new text. I think I like the keyless start but I wish there was a way to leave my radio playing and my cell phone charging without the vehicle being turned on. Maybe there is but if so it was not explained to me."
The way it drives
Nothing I love it!!!
Smooth quiet ride and affordable luxury!!!
"Fix the ABS.  Also, folding mirrors would be nice."
Looks and ride.  Intelligent cruise control.
My Murano is an exceptional vehicle. I love all the safety features. This is my 4th Nissan. I love the quality
Safety features and interior appearance
Rear back up sensors that increase if you are getting too close to an object.
Heated steering wheel.
I don't know I haven't driven it on a trip
The comfort
The audio volume is inconsistent  when using Bluetooth.
Exterior and interior attractiveness is the best.
Appearance
Nothing - I traded in a Mazda CX5 with the original 2.0 liter engine and hated it.  I am an aggressive driver and it had no take off zoom zoom.  This is a huge improvement for getting on the expressway every morning and night.
The engine and the luxury of the interior.
"3 things stand out - 1) the hood design that angles back towards the windshield reflects the sun at the front seat passengers in a dangerous way.  2) there is a plastic piece on the left front of the driver's seat that pokes into my left leg, causing irritation. 3) the cooled seats don't appear to work as well as other cooled seats that I've experienced (Ford Fusion for example) - other than those things, I love my Murano!"
styling and overall feel of the vehicle while driving.
"Gas mileage is not quite as good as I expected--about 23 MPG. I'm a pretty conservative driver. Mileage is a mix of city/highway. The driver's seat is not as comfortable as advertised--certainly not ""Zero Gravity."""
Looks fantastic. Great features. Handles well. Comfortable.
I am extremely disappointed with my new Nissan Murano 2016. After only two months the computer from my Nissan Murano started jumping from cell phone to audio to navigation and then just froze.
"Overall, what like most is the way it looks and drives."
Place for keys and wallet. Cover for trunk. Improve Nissan Connect.
"Smooth ride, confortable seats, display, exterior lights, console look with the silver, auto start, roomy, nice leg room, quiet inside, deep center console, and hand free. Good sound system."
Better gas mileage
Sets up high
Low gas mileage but expected for a car this size.
Ease of driving.
You need to work on the Bluetooth. Because it is terrible and the 2016 Murano.
Less outside air noise
Comfort
"Safety features, comfort, gentle ride, responsive steering."
The a.c. takes to long to get cold. I also own an exterra and the a.c. get cold very fast.   Also standing at the back of the car you can see a bracket hanging under the car. Other than these two issues I love the car very luxurious.
The technology
everything about my vehicle
getting car to dealer for small stuff is very inconvenient. pre delivery QC should have been better.
attractive car
Disfruto mucho mi nuevo vehculo porque es espacioso cmodo para manejar
Leather interior maybe. It's a nice enough vehicle but I wish I didn't trade my frontier for it.
The sleek design and silver on the inside.
"Better mpg, paint chipped easily.   That's it"
"The sunroof, and front collision system"
I would like head rests that allow me to sit upright.  Transmission seems at time to be slow to accelerate.
"the interior, that's why I bought it.  Cashmere..."
Nothing
Interior comfort and luxury feel
Add adjustable cell phone holder within arms reach.  Go back to previous design for Murano .
Handles well.
"Sometimes when I park, I like to sit and listen to the radio. In order to do this I have to turn the engine completely off and then turn the radio on.   The navigation system seems limited. I tried many times to find a local restaurant or store and couldn't."
The ride is smooth. The look is classy.
Interior and infotainment system.
Better city gas mileage. Also when starting the motor the first time each day the RPM's jump extremely high which in my opinion is not good before the oil has a chance to circulate. I bought the Tech package but do not have rain sensing windshield wipers which I believe should be included.  Gas mileage is the main issue I have with the car.
Comfort and appearance.
The car is comfortable and easy to drive.
front hood reflects sun glare back to glass windshield
suspension system
Get rid of annoying engine noise.
"Size, style and roominess."
Very happy except for the recall
The look of it and interior and exterior colors. The smooth handling on the road.
style and performance
Better fuel mileage.
The interior & seats
Future Muranos should have better interior lighting.  The remote opener for the garage should be offered on the SV.  More buttons on the steering wheel.
"Nice ride and the built in camera, and GPS."
"My only improvement I feel needed is that there's not enough storage spots in the dash area or center console area where the cup holders are for odds and ends. (Loose change, phone, pen, ect.)"
Priced well. Unique styling inside and out.
The gas milage on this veh is not as good as my previous model in my opinion. and the audio system is no as good either when it comes to talking on the bluetooth. Audio system is not working properly why I dont know
the look of the veh
"The murano was a very nice attractive car.  We did although have to sell it relatively quickly because it was too small for my husband to comfortably ride in it.  This is no problem with the car, it was a personal problem that ended up be very costly to us.  Over all, the car was very nice."
Style comfort drivablility
Increase the gas mileage but no decrease in power. The power is more significant than the mileage- unless gas becomes expensive again.
The simplicity/common sense design of all the accessory controls.
FIX MY PROBLEM WITH THE TEXTING ISSUE AND NOT HAVING ANY OF THE NISSAN CONNECT CAPABILITIES IN MY EXPENSIVE SUV.     OR GIVE ME SEVERAL YEARS WORTH OF OIL CHANGES FOR FREE FROM MY DEALERSHIP.
THE SEATS AND THE INSTRUMENT PANEL IN BETWEEN SPEEEDOMETER/RPM!!
"interior, comfort"
It would be nice to have a cool steering wheel option for the southern area.one free map update during owning the vehicle.
Bluetooth lane change help all the air bags while gas miles
"everything the total package! It fits us perfectly! There's nothing I would change or ask for. The seating comfort, the smooth quiet ride, ease of driving, sound system,  et all."
"I drove a hybrid for years.    Thus, my answers are reflecting that.    I have no recommendations beyond that note."
The feeling of safety.
Show me how to put in a test discription to a Nav address..
The front and rear Camera's
Exterior noise
Fuel economy
The flip switch to open the gas tank is in an awkward position on the bottom of dashboard. I often have to get out of the car to open this switch. It's a much used switch in an awkward position. Also awkward is It's hard to reach back to get an umbrella or my sunscreen reflector due to extending the middle console. These items are on the floor of the back seat. On my 2011 Nissan it was much easier to reach these items.
"It's technologically advanced. Great extra paint job. Also seat memory sets the steering wheel as well as the seats and mirrors. I didn't buy similar SUVs because I would have had to manually set the steering wheel every time a second driver sits down. Also car exterior looks fantastic, especially the wheels and aerodynamic styling!"
The safety features are excellent.  The memory seats are also a nice addition.
Shoulder harness hard to grab. No way to put names on addresses used on gps. Sales men so unacceptable that I would never buy another Nissan or recommend one.
Ease of steering. Good turn ratio. Very user friendly gps. Good looking.
The only thing I have found is there is not enough secure space in the glove compartment or center console.
"Everything, I love it!"
Love my new Murano
"Look, comfort and room"
no suggestions at this time
I am very comfortable while driving and I feel safe.
"Nothing, I am very satisfied  with the car."
It offers all the features I like (platinum version)
Everything
Nothing yet.  Have not driven it in the winter yet.
Like the mileage and the comfort.  Have not taken it on a long trip yet though.
I feel that I didn't get a good price for my trade in.
I like the appearance and all the touchscreen display.
Best car I have owned to date.
Looks and performance
"I love my new Murano.  Still getting to know all of the features, but have been very pleased thus far."
The comfort and technology.  It is a very comfortable/smooth ride.
"Going    from a lexus to a Murano (and noted by a friend coming from a bmw to a Nissan), the door sounds tinny upon opening. Not sure if it's the release of the handle on the door, but it sounds cheap."
"The value -- bells and whistles-- in comparison to a ""luxury"" car. But I hate the tinniness (sound) when opening the door.. a daily reminder it's not a ""luxury"" car."
Exterior appearance
The navigation system has been our only complaint with this vehicle. Plus only one phone can be active at a time. Not always the same driver so it would be advantageous if both phones were active.
"Looks, handling, ride."
I'm not sure what this question means.  What are my options.
"I love the Bluetooth and stereo, love that it gets as good of gas mileage as my Juke did with lots more room and smoother ride.  Love the CVT that Nissan has."
The ride
rear seats yo fold down for more room
looks and gas milage
I LOVE my new Murano! Maybe a little better gas mileage? But this is an exceptional vehicle ...
Everything!
the apperance and comfort
Love that it's a V6 and runs smooth.
"Fix paint quality. Rear seat auto folding useless for tall drivers as headrest do not fold down. Steering wheel controls clunky compared to our '16 Silverado.  Good on rough city roads but handles ponderously if driving quicker. CVT doesn't feel as good as conventional tranny. Adaptive Cruise control is super! Regret not having 4wd. Poor traction especially after rain. Reliability, roominess very good."
We do not anticipate reliably problems. Great for 4 adults size wise.  Styling is about aggressive as we would like but overall pleasant. (ditch the chrome on the front grill please) Safety features very good. (what happened to Lane departure?) Nice vehicle overall but could be better.
No real complaints so far.
"I really would of liked an option to the wheel design and size....My SV model didnt come with the 20"" wheel option, unless I paid for new 4 wheels."
"I really like the new generation design and overall look.  Its the leader in look, accessories, engine performance, head-lite led appearance, boomerang tail-lites really give the overall appearance a sleek and modern look. I would put it up against Lexus, mercedez or any other foreign vehicle."
"I have a 33,000.00 dollar car and I can't open the trunk from the inside. I am not pleased with that."
I love the size. It's roomy and very nice looking.
I'm happy with my vehicle! Going from a 2000 vehilce to a 2016 is big difference.
The way it handles and interior.
I love my new car and have nothing negative to report.
Visability
Having picked it up in perfect condition.
Very roomy with nice electronics and easy to read displays.
Fix NissanConnect to be compatible with the actual apps you advertise it to work with. Fix the bluetooth connect issue with phone calls. Visiting online forums shows these are both common complaints. The fact they are being ignored has me leaning toward this being my only Nissan purchase.
Interior comfort
Eliminate shut off delay on ignition switch- drives me crazy!
Looks and quiet driving
better quality of tires. The hood indentation near the windshield cavity creates a glare when driving towards the sun....very annoying and distracting.
"Handling, seating, technology, overall ride."
Fix the issue with the telephone blue tooth. Everything else is acceptable but the phone problem is very vexing.
remote start
"I don't think anything can be done at this point, unless the items cans be fixed without having to buy a new car.  The problem is you don't realize the issues while going for a test drive."
"It's a very nice ride, very quiet when the windows are closed."
causeway Nissan said they will fix the exterior blemishes the service advisor was very nice and will take care of my concerns
the looks and ride
We are extremely disappointed to have an abs recall notice a few weeks after purchasing car. Since we are planning to drive it cross country it is a major concern
The interior comfort and appearance
Better gas mileage
Design
Nothing
The design and the style of the vehicle.  I love the attention to detail and how all of the colors coordinate with each and the technology that comes with the vehicle
Better rear visibility.
Very comfortable solid ride
Nothing
I really do like my car a lot however I do have problems with using my phone device sometimes not all of the devices are enabled while I'm driving and I have to use my actual phone
It's actually a beautiful car the interior is very nice and the exterior is just as nice I always get a lot of compliments on my car
"The hatchback door, there is no way to open it slowly. What if something has fallen against it."
All of the driving tools
the 6 cylinder power plant.  i bought this Murano for the 6 cylinder power.
The gas pedal and brake pedals are too close together. Also seems like the pedals are too far to the right. uncomfortable for me.
The appearance.
"All safety features like blind side monitoring, lane departure warning and crash prevention should be standard on all your vehicles.  Take the safety technology in the new Altimas and include the Muranos.   Also, add ecoboost technology that shuts off the engine when at stops or idling to add more fuel efficiency.  See Dodge Durango and Chevy Malibu for this technology.   Also include a cargo cover as standard."
"Body Styling, color (pacific sunset), interior cargo space, intuitive all wheel drive and technology in the car (satellite radio, navigation, etc.)."
It has a beautiful ride and is very comfortable. Love that the driver seat   move forward when you get in and back when you get out.
Feeling of safety. Driving/sight above other vehicles
For the price paid the dealership could have offered futurecomp services
Aerodynamic lines
I love the vehicle. The only complaint would be cabin noice.
I love the way the vehicle looks.
Plastic molding around bottom of front seats scratches back of lower legs
Roominess
Consider another audio manufacturer for the Murano
"The reliability, my relationship with Nissan dates back to the Datsun era, so my expectations are exceedingly high for this vehicle."
"My overall grade rating of this vehicle would be a 10. The fuel economy for such a large vehicle is very good. The seat belts at times require an extra effort, especially unlatching them. This is I would say the nicest automobile I have ever owned and it is a quality car I feel good driving, riding and just overall performance. The power of the motor is very good and I prayed about a car before I bought this one and as soon as I saw it I knew this was the one."
"The plush leather crafted interior and the air conditioned seats. The warning prompts about outside traffic that could cause an accident, I truly like this feature. I am an overall happy camper with this car. This is definitely a 10 overall automobile that I am thankful for."
"Nothing to say,satisfied ,happy nothing to change, love it."
Rides comfortable
More information about the ABS recall. The information provided was very disturbing as to possible problems that could result. Every time a drive the vehicle I am concerned that something will happen.
The way it handles.
Ride and styling
Fix the ABS recall problem.  Address the roughness of the transmission.  Fix the driver seat memory and rough edge.
"Size and around view cameras, also blind spot indicator."
"The drivers seat belt clip could be streamlined/less bulky.  It digs into the side of my hip. I always have to try and move it. It does not do that when sitting in passenger seat.   Find an easier way to add addresses to navigation book.   Steering is very, very touchy.  Have not found a way to scan radio stations."
"Style, Look, Gas Mileage, Comfort, Nav pkg, Lane departure safety awareness."
One thing that can be improved on:  the moon roof.  There is no way that the moon roof can be stopped at an opening other than full exposure.  If the rear seat riders don't want exposure I can't adjust the opening. Very poor thinking!
Overall quality and ride are superior.
Style
Smooth ride
Cannot think of anything at the moment.  Love my Murano
The style and all around camera viewing.
"My complaint is the navigation system. EVERY time I have used it, it stops before the destination is arrived, with the automated voice saying due to road construction ahead, navigation is unable to continue. Please read a map."" This is very irritating, because I don't travel with a map and have to find a place to pull off the road and try to use my GPS on my phone to guide me. It has NEVER failed to direct me, and each time the Nissan system said there was road construction, I NEVER saw any construction anywhere near my destination. If this is not a common complaint, please let me know because I travel a lot and need a reliable car navigation. Thank you."
"The button auto-assist trunk opener, seat adjust recognition for driver and passenger, and the beautiful interior."
The more I drive it the better I like it.  One improvement I would like to see would   be heat & air vents in the cargo area since I  show dogs & need those for them.    I have managed to get fans to use back there so all is well
"It sometimes seems to not be ""hitting on all cylinders.""  It sorta hesitates"
"The safety feature of when a car ahead of me slows, so will my Murano.  I love that!"
Would like speakers in the rear.
This is our second Murano and we love it overall! Drives and handles well. We like the safety features.
Access as a passenger in moving vehicle to all aspects of tech panel - specifically navigation changes & use of phone/text response.  Storage in console was more efficient as a 2 separate component system. Miss storage separator in rear that flipped open with a button system. Seat belts still get caught when raising & lowering rear seats.
"Ease of operation; quiet interior; snazzy, streamlined appearance with additional exterior lighting - LOVE the (trademark) spiraling wheel covers."
This is the second Verano we have owned with a rouge in between and I absolutely love the murano
"It would have nice to be able to start the car from my phone.  Apparently all the other Nissans have this option.  I bought the 2016 platinum version, and expected it to come with that option.  Also having Sirius for more then 3 months, other brands give 6-12 months free."
"the ride, and style"
Nissan Connect needs to be fixed. It would be great if it worked
Exterior and interior appearance. Overall performance
Better storage
Looks
comfortable ride
This is the first non-domestic vehicle I have owned. Some of the non-driving controls are different and hard to get used to. I don't like the way the radio turns off as soon as the engine is turned off. Or how the doors don't unlock when the car is put in park.  There is more road noise than I would expect.
"The vehicle is roomy, and yet gas mileage is not bad, average 28 mpg.  Handling and appearance is very good."
Very pleased with my new Murano. No problems so far...
"Appearance,  comfort, reliability."
Appearance and performance
A little too uncomfortable going over small bumps in the road.
Roominess
The problem with the radio/phone is on acceptable. What I don't like about the interior is the molding around the front seats at the bottom. The plastic molding SortIt ends abruptly at the front of the seat. The plastic edge is sharp.  I frequently scrape my leg on the sharp plastic.   In spite of these problems I love the vehicle!
The high-tech safety features. And the adaptable cruise control.
"I am worried about rust showing up on the car within the first month of ownership and what that means as far as reliability overall-it is our first Nissan and we've had excellent luck with Honda and Toyota but chose the Murano for the looks, luxury and space"
The style and comfort of this vehicle!
"I don't care for this type of transmission, instead of a smooth upshift or downshift you can feel each change."
very comfortable seats
The black exterior paint almost looks textured because of the significant orange peel finish. The hood is the only surface I would deem acceptable. It's disappointing to a car fanatic who chooses black because instead of a flawless finish the black presents not much more than a flawed finish!
Overall design and interior quality.
it is much better finish than my previus Murano more atention to details would be welcome a specially for vehicle with 40000$tag price
exterior design
Allow conversion to CarPlay. Fix cellphone volume issue.
"Ride, comfort, looks, safety features."
The front seats could be a little deeper for long-legged people.
We love it.
All of it.
"So far, we are pretty happy with the purchase of our 2016 Nissan Murano--love the looks, color & comfort."
"Easier to get in & out of vehicle  than a lower built car, like the locking/unlocking  features & the GPS system is great to have, but takes some getting used to in how to use it."
MURANO is GREAT !!!
"The Murano has great acceleration and power, but the handling should be better since it is a Nissan.  It is too cushy, which leaves me less confident when driving. I had an Infiniti G35 for 10 years, so I guess I was expecting the steering and handling of the Murano to be pretty much on the same playing field.  I am sure that most female drivers would not have this complaint, however.   The seats are comfortable, but I believe the seats could be a couple of inches deeper so to extend thigh support for those of us that have long legs and long thighs.    The sound system could definitely have an upgrade.  It doesn't have the quality of bass and treble in the front that I was expecting. It is better in the rear.   Consider putting in a feature that allows the driver to fold in the outside mirrors electronically.  Also, I would add a blindspot monitor to the outside mirror as well as having the light on the inside.    It would be convenient for the passengers in the back to have the ability to control the airflow from the back AC vents.    A safety feature Nissan might consider is the lane departure warning system."
"My Murano is a beautiful vehicle with avant garde styling. The blue paint has a glimmering sheen because of the sparkles/glitter mix. The wheels are unique and appealing.   The interior is very comfortable and the center console is big enough for me to put my purse inside, which keeps it off the front passenger seat!  (minor but very practical)  I really like theAWD and all of the safety features offered.  Overall, I am so pleased with this vehicle.  It is a Crossover SUV that handles better than most sedans but has the room I need to travel with my show dogs."
There is really nothing I would change.
"Roominess, then gas mileage."
I have nothing to add. So far a truly exceptional experience.
"The technology, the style outside and the interior ."
There is a great deal more road noise than I care for and the engine seems to labor in comparison to our 2009 model.
"As long as it proves reliable and trouble free, we are glad we purchased a second Murano."
Quality of ride and appearance.
Number one the driver seat rubs against the middle console the leather on leather it makes it annoying squeaking sound major flaw in the design you either need to push the seat more to the left on the driver side or make the middle console smaller or just make the vehicle wider as a whole.  Number two there is no place to put your cell phone there's a side pocket on either side of the driver side that's it hate it you need something for me to park my phone on.  Number 3 there is no way to play a DVD player on the screen? It has to go behind the seats? Not acceptable I want to be able to do whatever the heck I want with my car when I want I don't want just a CD player in the console I want that screen to be able to play DVDs and YouTube videos and go on Facebook and everything else I realize you guys have it probably not because of safety features but you have to trust us drivers that we're not going to drive while watching a DVD or Facebooking or you to me it also needs to connect two iPads through Bluetooth major flaw.  Number 4 I do like the silver interior but when the Sun hits it shines in my eyes it's too big of a reflective floor another reflective fly the angle on the front hood when the Sun hits it just right it blind you even though I have a black car it's still reflects and hits me in the eye the angle is wrong pointing towards the driver's eyes right in front of the windshield the first part of the metal Hood.  Number 5 Trunk space? There really isn't any why did you guys not give it more space without having to drop down the seats it's really annoying I want the car to be wider in the back and I also want it to be longer yes I realize I can get the Armada Platinum Edition but I really don't want to pay the V8 gas all I'm asking is for an extra two feet no big deal.  Number 6 The rear trunk when it's open I'm six foot one I hit my head constantly on that stupid trunk when it's fully engaged in the upright position I always forget I'm tall and I hit it every time I need the car to be a higher clearance on the trunk.  Number 7 There is a grinding noise going from 0 miles to 25 miles an hour when stopped at a red light doesn't matter if the car is cold or warm it feels like the front wheel drive works perfect the rear wheel drive takes a minute to kick in when it does it gives it a slight jerking sound it is annoying need to be fixed.  Number 8 I got the technology package with this vehicle and the rear behind the console only is a USB port? It doesn't trickle charge? I would like a 12 volt charge back there for my friends we don't need a trickle charge port USB it can be both you guys are smart figure it out.  I've only had this car for 2 months and this is what I've noticed you guys need to hire me to test drive and really critic your cars because man I love this car to death but there are so many problems and design flaws in it Sincerely Me
It's a really great ride the Murano Platinum all-wheel-drive is a fantastic car I just figured paying 50 grand for this thing... they could be better that's all I'm saying.... please refer to my earlier comments ....but it's a beautiful sexy car I get a lot of compliments.
Pay it off for me.  :)
"It's new, it rides great, love the looks, sound system is wonderful, roomy."
"Very smooth ride, a beautiful car!"
"color, comfort, nice to drive"
Have safety seat belts for middle seat. Fix bugs in cell phone connection and Satalite radio. I won't buy it after trial period.
Room and how safe it is for my grandkids.
"Fix the darn front seats!  They suck.  (And I'm not a large, or tall man.  I can only imagine a large or tall driver driving this car for the first time.  If they are smart, they won't buy it!)"
"Drive ability, gas mileage, performance, looks."
Nothing needs to be done
"Appearance, comfort, handling"
Very roomy inside-nice ride-Exterior look is nice
Passenger seat needs a height adjustment method.
I like most things about it except for the LED dash panel lighting.
I like the car very much. Manage meant of Bluetooth devices  could be simpler and work better. Also could have done without the car not starting the one time and the recent recall.
"Stylish, decent power, handling, seat heaters and coolers, steering wheel heater, cargo space, visibility at night."
Finding blind spots when driving or turning.
Looks
Make blind spot warning standard.  Power lift gate standard would be nice too.
Smooth quiet ride.
"I down sized from a Pathfinder so my issues are my own, just not as much space but that was by choice, not design."
"I like the sportiness of the car.  Fun to drive, picks up speed quickly and handles well on windy roads."
Bigger gas tank. My 2014 holds a few more gallons. But we love the 14 and 16
Engine
The styling and the exterior color!
Great vehicle
Seat comfort
I need to get the noises sorted out when I have time to call to dealer.
Reliable and comfortable vehicle.
"I am very happy with my Murano!  It handles well, and is so comfortable to drive and ride in.  The only criticism I have is not for the vehicle; it is for the generic user manual.  The term ""if so equipped"" is aggravating.  It would be better to have instructions that applied to the specific vehicle purchased!"
"The seats are extremely comfortable, and road driving is so easy.  You feel very much in control on curvy roads or interstate highways.  The lane assists are new to me, but have found them to be extremely helpful."
Interior is beautiful. Bluetooth but I was it had CarPlay as a feature.
Nissan service is wonderful.  I would hate it the highest score.  Engineering needs to take a look at the design of the back up mirror feature and adding chime for seat belts.  Those two items need to be address and Nissan Marono would be close to perfect!
"Comfort, style, handling."
Appearance
The seats could be more comfortable. Tires seem to not hold air like they should. Gas mileage could be better. Over all it is a nice vehicle that I am enjoying.
It is a nice looking vehicle that I enjoy driving.
The placement of the controls on the steering wheel are ackward. Need to be back like they were on the 2007 murano steering wheel.
It's looks and engine performance.
Happy overall. Steering feels way over boosted  The doors have a tinny sound when they closed. I know it's a Nissan and not a Mercedes but I transport new Toyotas everyday and thier doors have a much more substantial feel when they're closed
Absolutely love the styling! THE technology is also great although not a big fan of the adaptive cruise control.
I think it needs the cross over the center line function.
The look of the vehicle and the way it drives.
I'm very disappointed that it has been recalled.
the safety features
n/a
do not really care for the streaky looking trim on the dash and console. I    would prefer a solid color.
I like the way it drives. Has a good solid feel. Handles corners well and    has good power. Very comfortable seats. I like the navigation system also.   Better than others i have used.
Just having the ability to raise seats higher
Handling
Todo esta muy bien confiable
El espacio q hay de los asientos
Nice quality vehicle. Ride comfort and engine performance
"Improve the radio reception, AM and FM, with a better and more effective radio antenna.  On the beautiful, well appointed, and fun to drive 2016 Murano with very good gas mileage and excellent safety features and intelligent cruise control the AM and FM radio reception is very disappointing to say the least.  I consider it a negative which will be reflected in any future vehicle purchases."
"I like the styling and overall features, short turning radius, and acceleration.  The interior is well designed and thoughtfully done.  The front seats are very comfortable and supportive.  I have driven almost 500 miles in one day without being sore and stiff in the drivers seat, exceptional."
The steering wheel would go down a little lower.
"The safety features along with quietness, style and drive ability of the vehicle."
I love this car.
"The shape of the car, and the seats."
Sometimes when I'm driving on the highway it feels like the wind is pushing my car to one side when it's not even windy.
"Other than that one issue, it's perfect"
I wish the driver seat was able to extend under my legs like in my Maxima.
Have the windshield fixed and determine if the air sound inside the car is normal - did not seem to be this loud with the 2015 murano
Ease of driving and better price than the SRX
"Improve suspension to decrease bounciness and feel sportier, improve turning ratio. Regarding the paint is just quality control, I noticed the fit of the left headlight off and the minor paint defect was obviously painted over debris. Just basic attention to detail that should have been corrected before the vehicle left the factory. I am definitely expecting better from Nissan and despite these minor flaws I trust the quality and durability of your vehicles."
"The safety and technological features, sound and navigation systems. Even with the bounciness the ride is quiet and composed and the interior look and materials are comparable to luxury brands at a reasonable price. I also like the fact that my vehicle looks totally different than the other crossover SUV's."
I love it
More cushion or support in the seat.
The way it drives.
I love my new car!
"size, luxury, interior"

"Comfort, fuel economy"
It could hold more then 1 cd. Radio can have names of the songs playing on cd and radio
The body style
Exterior sound dampening would be good. It's like a truck a lot of exterior tire and wind noise. Wider rear passenger seats. To fit 3toddler car seat or booster seat. Bigget side rear windows. I drive many vehicles many different sizes.The Murano has to much blind spots. When not using back up canera
Engine is Quiet. Throttle response and braking is very good. Cargo space is very roomy
"It's weird that my old 2011 Subaru Legacy limited stereo system sounds better than this Murano. I hope Nissan will have an optional for a higher / better  system in the future so I can avoid to replace the after market system which cost around $2,000.00. ..."
Safety features /good gas mileage/ interior design and comfortable
Dependability
"exterior and interior is very good but i have some issues water leaking from hood, some extra noise in inside the car when i drive."
Exterior & interior and navigation
love it!
appearance
"Fix visor.When buying the vehicle we inquired about purchasing roof rails.  We were told they would be ordered and installed when we went for our first appointment in the service department.  Service department knew nothing of this, we were told they would order and contact us.  Still we have heard nothing."
The ride.
I like my  vechicle I wouldn't change a thing
The style and performance
I love my Murano. I can think of no improvements right now.
Everything
I think it is an excellent vehicle that meets or exceeds my expectations.  The few minor issues (scuffs and dash board raddle) I blame on the dealership's poor customer and after sales service.
Its look and overall and how it drives.
Make the trim not so shiney and glossy
Looks and engine. Standard electronics are a plus
better color choices moveable back seat
style overall performance
I love my new Murano.  This is my 5th one and by far it is the best one.

Improve the fuel tank make sure it last more miles
Everything but the gas situation
Everything's fine love it.

"The style, Both inside and out"
"Exterior body style, interior layout"
"Very happy with the over-all handling and comfort of the vehicle. I am still getting used to the trade-offs from my previous vehicle. (heated leather seats, memory driver seat adjustments, etc) Obviously, the model we chose is not so equipped.  Not unhappy with the vehicle at all, just still getting accustomed."
"The size and comfort, navigation screen; overall very satisfied."
"So far, so good except for the drivers seat discussed earlier."
This is mu 4th murano and each one has been better than the last.
It is extremely comfortable to drive.  The driver and passenger  front seats are great for tall individuals.
"I feel the molding around the bottom of the seats is protruding some and if my leg is bent, the corner of the plastic cuts into my calf on my leg and is annoying."
the comfort and driving experience
A new car
"Overall satisfied. However, there seems to be a problem with heating"
"The look, reliability, comfort riding"
The interior plastic appears to be very cheaply made. It also looks very cheap and should be replaced with true brushed stainless for a contemporary feeling. I looked at the white interior with the leather the plastic mother of pearl and it looks something like from the 1970s which was absolutely ugly. I did not buy that model. l I got the black leather interior that had the look of the brush stainless.  However the brushed stainless look should be replaced with a true stainless to make it look even better.
Fuel economy
Handling
"I think that the seats should be more comfortable, better help with posture."
I'm happy to my new car. I like everything in this car except  that vibration.
The only thing that is even slightly uncomfortable with this vehicle are the radio volume controls on the steering wheel.  They are a little awkward to use and would be more comfortable to use if they were on the back of the steering wheel cross bar or higher up on the front of the cross bar.
"I love the interior of this vehicle!  I have driven a few SUV/Crossover type vehicles and this one has the roomiest interior when compared to the Ford Edge, the Volvo XC60 or the Jeep Cherokee."
It handles great  on curvy roads
I dislike mostly the storage areas in the car.  The door pockets are useless as well as the console side pockets.  They hold nothing!!!!!
The fuel average is better than my previous Murano (2006) and the new technology is certainly an update.
N/A
The smoothness of the vehicle
Wish outside mirrors would fold in automatically.  All else seems. Fine at this time.
Visuals and cameras.  Awesome.
These are all pretty small things. The paint chipping was by far the most frustrating as I hadn't even made a payment. The wind noise could be better but is what it is at highway speeds. I'm confident the dealership will fix the console and it'll be fine.
It is comfortable on the road and a good fit for our family.
"I don't like the black clothe seats in the car, the material feels like it is an inferior product. ""Everything sticks to it as well."
The outside visual appearance and it handles well.
Offered ground lighting & better backup lighting...
front seats
The garage door opening buttons on rear view mirror would be better if illuminated.
Body style and interior comfort
Allow the side mirrors adjustment to be manual in lieu of automatic when backing.
Sleek look of the interior
Nice ride and performance.
All good
Love the pearl interior!
Swap out or paint the side dash air vents so they don't reflect in the rear view mirrors.
I really enjoy the ride and the power it has.  I only wish it got better gas mileage.
Compared to my 2008 Altima S the Murano SV audio system is horrible. It distorts when the volume is only half way up. I feel efforts to cut costs were made in the audio system. The speakers are sub par.
Information in the gauge cluster. Leather touch accents all over even though it's cloth interior.
You need a sound alert if the passenger seat belt is not fastened. You need sensors and alerts in front and rear bumpers. You need automatic emergency calling if air bags are deployed.
The variable speed transmission. The interior decor and lighting.
We are thrilled with the Murano. It is the first time we purchased a Nissan. One was on display at the Home Show in Daytona Beach last year. We were impressed and decided to check it out. We also looked at the Cadillac SRX and the BMW. The Murano offered more features and luxury. It's a great SUV.
The comfort is outstanding.
Fix the wind noise problem PLEASE!!!
Looks and handling
"The navigation stinks.  The maps are not up to date and it's absolutely ludicrous to charge $100 per year for updates.  Garmin stopped that practice years ago.  Basic phone operation is supported but phone applications are not.  A ride in my neighbor's Chevy showed me that android applications on a phone can be integrated with the onboard navigation system, even Google Maps.  Why would you install a navigation system made in Europe in a car built and sold in the US?"
"All the positive comments from friends and family. The adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance features."
Our second Murano we love it
"Sound system, comfort"
"Different looks, excellent drivers cockpit and layout"
I absolutely love the comfort of the seats. I love the technology that's in it.
I will have the seat fixed when I have the first service.
It's looks. How it drives. The gas mileage for a SUV.
its ok
good looking auto
Repair the ding in my passenger door that happened due to neglect during detailing
Seats are extremely comfortable
Everything is great.
Technology
"I would have preferred if they would have offered me a new bumper cover that was factory painted and matched. The dealer said it was normal. I've bought  20 cars in my life and never seen this before, so I tend to disagree with them as I've never seen it. I was going to address the transmission at the first service when it's time."
The styling and overall quality.
have a much better towing capacity if i  had known it was so low i would not have bought it
style and ride
Exterior design
N/A
"Internal features of the vehicle - technology, seats, safety notifications and dashboard."
"Design electric seats for the Murano S.  Also have blind zone (BZ) mirrors as standard equipment for all Murano vehicles.  Blind Zones are a problem when driving, I feel that you do not have customer safety as a top priority."
The only thing that was wrong with my first Murano S was no electric seats.  I like my new Murano SV (at a $4500 upgrade).
How it looks
"make sure dealer trade is honest about the mileage on a new vehicle, not happy about that"
This is my second one and it is great for our lifestyle
The reason i marked a problem with the interior is that we have had it documented at the dealer that there is a hairline crack (very small) in the dash.  They could not tell if it is surface or deeper.  We had it documented in case it worsens.  We noticed it the day after we brought the vehicle home.
"Wow, it has so many nice features, it is hard to pinpoint one."
"If someone could call me, that would be nice"
Safety
The cruise control making automatic braking and resuming speed
"Nothing at all, I love it"

I like everything about my new vehicle.
buy a larger vehicle.i have not been completely satisfied with the new leased vehicles that I haveleased in the past.a 1979 Lincoln town car was the best auto that was roomy and comfortable for my size!!!
its looks.
Everything is great
Like everything
Hopefully they will fix the wind noise.  As I said I love this Murano!!!!
"Comfort of Seats, Fantastic Styling and Appearance. Great technology in every way especially adaptive cruise control, blind spot, and all the cameras... It almost drives itself!!!"
"Fix the blue-tooth issue.  When purchasing this vehicle I test drove the CRV and the Rav4.  This vehicle felt the best based on comfort and technology.  However I wish this vehicle did have the camera in the passenger side mirror that when you put your turn signal on to the right, it would show that camera view in the nav center like the CRV.  Otherwise, no vehicle is perfect, but I love this one."
Comfort and Tech
1. You should have included accent lights in the well (near the brakes) so that would complete the interior accent lighting.
The look & feel.
Seat belt every time twest.  My car platinum but seat control 3 function.  Out inside interior not detail and inside noises   Compare Lexus NX AWD and Murano platinum almost same price. How much details how much quiet.  I chose a Murano it's V6 powerful. Lexus nx 4 tubo.  I really like a Murano but little be disappointed..
"Power outside car shaves, line v6   It's future design.  Especially outside line"
Nothing love the car
Way it handles and the power
Improve quality of interior materials particularly plastic - thin and cheap feeling    Some controls placed on steering wheel are not visible .  All  Controls placed on steering wheel are too small and cheap feeling

no recall. My vehicle has already been recalled.

Very happy with vehicle.
"I like a having great looking, reliable vehicle."
The actual mileage should be made to match what we were told it would be.
The way it drives   Very attractive  Comfortable
Roan and engine noise are very noticeable on this new Murano.  It sounds as if a window is open.  The acceleration is more sluggish than our other Murano that is a older.
It's very roomy and sporty looking.
"I think paint is not of good quality.  I like to keep my vehicles like new, and every time I wash it I find a new scratch.  Paint seems to be very soft."
I Iike the looks.
"Larger rear window. Rear view mirror is like looking out of a tunnel.  Sunglass Holder in overhead--- This is absolutely USELESS! I have contacted Nissan support over this, I have a Case #, and I have taken the vehicle to a dealer as instructed to confirm the issue. Simply put, there is no type of glasses that will fit and be secure. The ""Nose Bridge"" component in the vehicle is way to large to allow ANY type of glasses to fit."
"Quiet, comfortable, responsive. Good handling. Good acceleration, although the engine does sound a little like a sewing machine on initial acceleration. Controls for Audio, Cruise, etc. on the steering wheel are well placed and convenient. Blind spot alert is accurate and visually well placed. Cruise control with the ""Vehicle Ahead"" function is exceptional. Functionality and visual feedbacks from the speedometer console screen are very helpful."
The dealership turned my experience bad
The options
Completely satisfied.  The only downside is fuel economy but we knew that going into the purchase.  We were willing to give up gas mileage for comfort and the security of AWD
"The comfort and ride.  I have drove and ridden in vehicles that are much larger that are much less comfortable.  For a midsize vehicle it is very comfortable for me and I am 6'4"" tall."
"We're pretty disappointed. This is our 4th Nissan, and we most likely will not be buying another. It's been minor problems, but it's cost us a lot of time taking it in for this rattle, this squeak, sunroof replacment, sun roof rattle.    I honestly wish I could get my old Maxima back, I owned it for years with no problems"
It's new.
"The gas mileage is OK, but could be better for the size of car it is."
I like the way it drives and it has a very quiet interior.
"still learning, but so far, very nice"
"Very comfortable seats, stylish looks"
"Find a fix for the Bluetooth issue, it is extrmemly frustrating. There should be some sort of compensation considering I am making monthly payments for something hat does not work and Nissan has no fix at this time. PLEASE HELP! I fill out these surveys all the time and it doesn't seem to make a difference."

"Wish they replaced all 4 tires. Going to be nightmare when they rotate. They took original front and put on rear. Would like to be able to utilize the Bluetooth in a new 40,000 dollar vehicle. Also would like the vibration fixed."

A little more power would be nice.
The functionality.
I am extremely satisfied with my new Nissan!  The whole experience from test driving to the purchase has been positive.
"The size, the way it handles on the road.  And the new car smell!!"
outstanding as received from dealer   no changes needed
exterior is outstanding with many comments and interior also receive many comments.   safety features are outstanding
The beautiful design of the Murano takes away some usable storage/cargo space.  Console lacks surface storage tray.  Ipod/iPhone compartment's door is hinged backward.  Compartment needs a grommet to pass a charging cable through.  Compartment could be a little larger to fit iPhone 6/6+/7 with a case.
Controls on the Murano are well thought out.  Ride is superior to anything in its class.
I love the vehicle.  Not really much I would change.
The vehicle is very quiet and comfortable to drive.
Nothing. Perfectly happy
Comfort of the seats and smooth ride
"There is a lot more wind noise than my last car, especially around the sunroof."
Love the size!  Nissan is one of the few that offer a 2-row SUV with a V-6 engine.
I love it!!!!!!@!!
Everything. I traded a Honda CRV and the moment I began the test drive I knew I would buy it.
"interior fit and finish, A little quieter, Mirror reflection"
"Over all Look, Seating, Drive"
I have called the dealer each time my blue tooth quits working.  But they always tell me they can't do anything unless it messes up with them.  One time I drove clear over to dealer 30 minutes away and when I got there and turned car off it started working. I started my car and left out the drive and it quit. I turned around and parked in a driveway turned it off and on and then it started working again.  This happens about one out of three or four times that I drive the car.  It seems to happen after I have turned car off and then get back in.
the looks and the comfortable ride.
EVERYONE WAS VERY POLITE AND ANSWERED ANY QUESTIONS WE. PATTERSON NISSAN IN LONGVIEW IS A VERY GREAT PLACE TO BUY VEHICLE. EVERYONE THERE IS VERY HELPFUL. THE ONLY PLACE I BUY VEHICLES.
PREFORMANCE
the ride is really smooth.
I love my new Murano!
everything!
Fuel economy and touchscreen surface/software.
Interiors and drive
The rear door is difficult to open.  It takes a lot of effort and when your hands are full that is frustrating.  The transmission sounds like a 4 cylinder in distress.  The wind sound is too loud in the car when driving.  There are a few blind spots when making turns.
The looks and room inside the car
It could be a bit quieter.
Mostly everything; it is beautiful!
Interior and tech package
I would like to have the cargo cover come with the vehicle.  The moon roof cover does not stop until the sun roof is open. I would like to just open the cover and not the roof at times.
l love the colors of the interior and the shell in the interior.  I love the interior lighting at night in the car. I like the technology offered in the car with the smart cruise control.  I love the durability of the Nissan and am looking forward to driving it for a long time.
Overall---it's fantastic. Especially like the air conditioned seats!

It's an SUV and fun to drive.
"Overall, it's a great vehicle and the reviews indicate that it should be reliable for a long time which is ultimately why we chose the Nissan over the Explorer. What I am disappointed with:  - I would prefer the ability to lock the vehicle into 4wd  - I would like an option to open my door without having the key on me the way I could in my old Explorer  - I would prefer the sound / navigation to pair correctly utilizing the Nissan Connect  - I would prefer the vehicle have the ability to tow our fairly light weight boat the way my Explorer was able to"
"I believe it will be reliable based on previous Murano owners and their overall experiences with the vehicle. This is important since I drive many miles each year to/from work, often in inclement weather."
The color
Quality control at the factory.  I have also had the car back to the service department to repair a transfer case oil leak. I was disappointed that a car with only 1700 miles on it has developed an oil leak.
"No road noise, which was a feature I was looking for."
Easy to operate
"Tech, style and comfort"
Cupholders and door all four doors could be bigger barely holds a bottle of water most cups today our way wider than that could use some extra consul room in the front seat like there's nowhere for a woman to put her purse if there someone in the front seat passenger front seat
Absolutely love back up camera the 360 camera to the fact that my CRV did not have a remote garage door opener in it I love the blind spot warning car looks absolutely beautiful I hate white cars but I bought one in the pearlized White it was a special paint it just looked awesome on the show room I also would not prefer a dark interior but  bought one because this was so spectacular on the showroom floor yeah absolutely love the double sunroof all the airbags running down the side the near bad for the driver absolutely fabulous safety
It is an awesome vehicle however transmission seems to jerk at times so seems to come on and off here I'm not sure what cost to set up the fuel economy is very poor not what was advertised
Appearance and comfort
The ability to add accessories my Murano so I can Haul my mountain bike and kayaks. It a very versatile vehicle for out door activities.
"The thing I miss most about my previous vehicle is that the rear seats moved forward and back.  I almost never had to put the seat backs down.  Though, they are very easy to lower and raise in this car."
All the safety features are great.  I do love the overhead camera - I use it to pull the car as far as I can into the garage - without hitting anything.  I use it to check that I'm clear of driveways or red curbs when I park on a street.  And I love how it looks.
work great. seems like there is always a wind sound coming from moon roof. other than that - it is great
feels great to drive; i feel safe; makes me feel comfortble
Nice
Fix recall quickly.
Easy to drive and comfortable
Just have someone look at our upholstery to see if it is something that will cause problems later.
Roominess and ease of handling and it looks great. Comfortable on long trips.
Styling and performance
It's the best vehicle I have ever had. The fuel economy could be improved. A little more punch with the engine would be nice but I'm not complaining. Your asking the questions.
Everything but especially the comfort and ride of the Murano. I've had Hondas and Toyotas but this Murano is the most satisfying todate.
"The seats could be a little more plush, more leg room and standard raise and lower on passenger seat"
"Overall style, comfort and reliability. AWD is nice."
"Fix the bluetooth!  It's the main reason I was looking forward to having a new car for the first time in 15 years, but it doesn't work reliably at all."
The bluetooth when it works.  But it's also what I dislike the most since it's so unreliable.
"Everything, just an amazing vehicle"
"It is an outstanding vehicle. Most of our issues thus far are minor and will disappear with time as we get more used to the vehicle. I think it is nice to offer a feature like the NissanConnect apps, but they are difficult to implement and understand. I did not find the Nissan owner's portal and Connects websites to be particularly helpful in terms of answering questions or providing support for the NissanConnect apps."
"We really appreciate all of the safety features (including those included with the technology package), and our buying decision was based as much on safety as anything else. Once again, this is an excellent vehicle, and I believe we will come to appreciate it more with time as our comfort level increases. We have only had our new Murano for a little over 2 months now (3000 miles), so I have not yet had an opportunity to see how the AWD system performs in inclement conditions."
see responses in previous questions
"new body style, quality of interior and technology package.  I owned a 2009 Murano and upgraded to the 2016, it's awesome."
Easy to drive
Seat belt in the center back seat is hard to get to with it being on the ceiling.   That would be the only thing I would change.
Love my new car!
There is a blind spot when backing up on the sides of vehicle. Camera shows directly behind but seeing out the sides is difficult.
The Murano is attractive inside and out and so far has performed nicely.
We are till adjusting and getting acquainted with all that the car has to offer.  We are very happy with our vehicle.
We love the blind spot feature
Make accessing drivers seatbelt easier . More than 1 chime on cross traffic alert an seat belting not engaged chimes.
quiet ride and good engine performance comfortable seating
I overall love how it look inside and out
Smooth drive  Room inside  Cooling seats  Attractive inside & out  Blind spot
Not Much!
"The styling, all of the safety features!"
My wife has a hard time pulling the lift gate down from the raised position ( no we do not have the power liftgate option ) I find it does take a lot of effort to pull it down
"Value for the money, and style"
This is my second Murano. I absolutely love it as much as the first if not more. I am constantly getting thumbs up and compliments.  .
"It is hard to pick out just one thing. You've gone overboard on the interior both in looks and comfort. My car is white, and the cream leather with the two color molding is gorgeous."
"Fuel economy for sure, I think if it was offered in a 4 cylinder as well for fuel economy that would be great!  Also there is a huge problem with a visual blind spot in the back right quarter.  You CANNOT see after passing to move back over without taking a chance of another car being on you right.  This is a major problem in the design of this vehicle.  Other than those 2 issues, I very much love it."
The interior room and quality. The seat is fabulous.  I have had my back and neck fused therefore I tried every vehicle in this class but cld not comfortably drive any of them.  I have had 3 Nissan Altima and didn't want to trade the last one in but northeast weather and the need for a higher sitting vehicle gave me know chose.  I tell people it has the interior of my Altima but just on steroids!!
Reposition the usb port in the front of the car. Minimize the wind sound from the sunroof. I didn't have that issue with my first Murano. My only other issue is that I can never find a place to put my purse in the car. Sounds silly but it is extremely frustrating.
I love the level of technology that I have in this vehicle but the best is the way it handles.
"My problem is not the battery issue now, but on-going problems connecting my cell phone.  Main concern is paying $6,500 down on a 2015 lease that I used for about 16 months.  Then I got into another 2016 lease and paid $6,643 down. I  was taken advantage off!  What happened to the extra $ I paid down for such a short term?  It should have been applied to the new lease.   I would have been much better off If I had just agreed to a higher monthly payment with less down payment.    Noel 908-553-0703"
"Storage, color, and body.  This is my family 5th NISSAN"
It's hard to close the trunk at times. I don't have automatic push buttons.  When it comes to frost or just the car having water on the windows it doesn't defrost on the side mirrors or my side windows as my old 2004 vehicle. I have to use a tool every morning to clean my windows so I can see when out of them when driving.
The ride is nice smooth
All the safety features
I wish the sunroof opened more in the back like it does in the front.
The seats are comfortable when driving long distances.
More horse power
The look
"Handling, driving comfort, appearance, technology."
"Great car, I enjoy driving it."
The heated steering wheel was  much better on the maxima then the murano. Also the heater has to be turn all the way to 80 to feel the difference. Otherwise I have no complaints so far.inhave only had the car since the end of August .
"Love the interior, navigation screen,sunroof overall appearance of the car . Also I live the tire pressure warning both low pressure and the correct tire pressure when air is needed.,,..the fold down  seats for storage is a plus"
The backup camera should have a better or louder beep when encountering cross traffic. Can hardly hear it
"Heated steering wheel without upgrading to a higher purchase price.  Even with 18 instead of 20"" wheels, ride is still a bit stiff.  However, overall driving experience is easy and comfortable.    Love the forward camera screen, I use it for parking all the time!!  I was already spoiled with back up camera on my old Nissan Murano."
forward computer screen with full view around car..  Comfortable ride  spacious  liftgate button  remote start  color combination (light on light)  cute appearance  expensive looking  love all the chrome!!
The silver trim around dash should be less shiny often interfere with side mirror reflection of trim is seen in mirror
Pretty much everything
Fuel economy could be improved a bit.
Style
"There should be a button to open the hatch back door inside the vehicle.  I have to get out of the vehicle and manually open it.  I have a Murano SV, for the price of the vehicle there should be a more convenient way of opening the hatch door. I purchased my Murano brand new in August and still can't figure out how to lock and open the doors from the outside handle button.  I just figured out how to use the navigation system.  Unfortunately the salesman who sold me the car wasn't there to deliver it.  The salesman who delivered it was caught off guard (he thought I was shown all the features, but I wasn't) not his fault. I guess I expected a better delivery from the salesman who sold me the vehicle, especially that I put down $20,000 in cash!"
I like the roominess and the smooth drive.  I've owned two Cadillac CTS's prior and the smoothness of the Murano is much better in comparison.
I love my Murano so far.
nothing more than another- the fuel economy has been a pleasant surprise and the space. The looks is GREAT!  I wish the back has a rubber mat.
"I don't like the fake ""shifting"". It's a CVT, and I wish it didn't pretend to shift. Also, it ""downshifts"" and doesn't let the car coast when going down hill, negating the fuel saving benefits of being able to coast down a hill. The suspension feels surprisingly cheap, but not bad. I'm not sure how to express what I mean by cheap."
"The overall package of AWD, good looks, comfort, assumed reliability, and value."
The headlights are not very bright- only on high beam can I see well.  The car feels light as if it doesn't hug the road.  The slant of the windshield produces a glare
It is very comfortable and the fuel mileage is super.  Great backup camera
"Comfort and features (I have the platinum).  The only grip I have, which is minor, is the interior tailgate release button by the steering wheel has to be pushed hard to release."
Everything!!!
"I am just completely satisfied with the Murano in general - I had a 2011 Murano that I traded for the 2016 - If I didn't find exactly what I wanted in a new model, I would have kept the 2011 until I did"
Overall I'm very satisfied.  This is my first Nissan and I hope it continues to be reliable.
They way it drives and the stylish look of the exterior.
"Approaching the top of a hill,and making a left turn the Mirror and driver post block my view."
It's a nice vehicle.  Gas millage.  Would like the back seats to move to make more room for dog to be comfortable and able to get out of the car easier.
Previously owned 2 Muranos and this vehicle is top quality.

The size as it is easy to get my kids in and out.
I love my Nissan Murano...it is my favorite vehicle I have ever owned.  I love everything about it...from the size to the sporty look and the beautiful interior.  I purchased it from POMOCO Nissan of Hampton and it was the best auto buying experience of my life or my husband's life!
I lov e this car more than any other car I have had except a 1978 Ford LTD broughm.
"The car is sexy looking.  The sleek design and the shape of the doors and the little details on the car are awesome,"
It would be nice upon delivery of the vehicle or shortly there after to have an appointment or a class to learn all of the different features that this vehicle has on it it would greatly enhance the operation for the owner.
"I love that I feel safe in the vehicle with the safety features such as the many airbags, the approaching the vehicle alert, and on the side and front and rear those are all great features."
I had a little bit of a bad experance when I bought my new car but it has been   better lately.I hope they can fix my car when I do take it in for repair.I know a person  who had a Rav 4 that had the same problem but they never could get it fixed so he  traded it off after 4 times to the dealer for repair.I hope that I don't have the same   problem.
I really like every thing about the car so far except the fact that the nav sys doen't  silence the radio when it gives directions and that might just be me not setting it up   the right way who knows.
Exterior
Great vehicle!  Thanks to the dealership(Gastonia Nissan) and to the manufacturer!
It's an awesome vehicle---in every respect!
"I am very much pleased with the vehicle and thoroughly enjoy it, but the stereo system is one among the worst i have ever seen in any of the car. And i am not able to install Bose after the vehicle is purchased, it would be of great help if this is heard."
unsure at this time
"confort, easy to use controls, smooth ride,"
I totally blame myself for not looking over the car better the few problems I have will not effect overall performance of vehicle my mistake rated very good by consumer reports let my guard down.
room inside and nice smooth takeoff
Nothing.....  My issues are very minor.
"Ride, roominess, and outstanding technology."
"Improve mpg, quieter transmission"

It's appearance
"Nice, good looking vehicle. Gets better gas mileage than I expected. Plenty of power."
Must be fixed or I want to return it!!  Bought a 2016 Maxima a few weeks before the Murano and am fairly pleased with it comparatively
Not sure since we are not being heard on this difficult issue that was turned away twice by dealer. WE NEED SOMEONE FROM NISSAN TO CONTACT US AND GET THIS RESOLVED! HAVE BOUGHT NUMEROUS NISSANS IN THE PAST BUT THIS ONE MAY BE OUR LAST IF NOT RESOLVED
"Looks great, easy to drive, fantastic entertainment system and navigation, good amount of storage space."
Safe
"The a/c system blows warm air for the first few minutes of driving, even when I have the temperature set at 69 degrees.  After the first few minutes, it cools down.  Not sure if this is normal, but will have it checked out at a local dealer."
Ride quality and looks.
"Electronics are very nice. Decided for the Pacific sunset color just to  change the same boring white / black. Found that this color gets dirty much sooner that the previous white and also while driving I see some unwanted reflections on the hood which interfere with driving. The seat belts do not retract properly,same problem than my old Pathfinfder. Maybe it is too early to comment on other problems but for the time being I am glad I bought Nissan again"
"Electronics is very nice,motor seems more responsive (guess this is due to lower weight)."
Great
The blind spot assist and cameras when the car is in reverse
not a thing love it.
the ride and appearance and power
Reliability
Cruise Control automatic braking.
Look
Awesome vehicle!
Everything!
The new body
I wish the car were more quiet when riding down the interstate or highway.  The defect on the dashboard irritates me for the money I spent on the car.  Quality of the materials should be better and inspected prior to delivery.
"The look, the handling of the car, the cooled and heated seats."
It is the way it is. The dealership says there is no adjustment to be made. They said it would get better with wear and use.
I purchased a new 2009 Murano that I still own. It is an outstanding vehicle. The new one has the technology I want. I can live with it and hope for the reliability I have experienced. That is the reason I bought the new one.   I have great faith in the dealership to continue their great service.
Nothing that I know of at this time.
"Driving and features,"
No pressure          No problems yet
Safety features and navigation
Everything is outstanding!
Smooth quiet ride and extremely comfortable seats. Blind spot detection is fantastic!
To be honest my overall experience at the dealership has left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm basically waiting for the other shoe to drop and I haven't really been able to enjoy the car. It's a new car and having had a Nissan previously I know it should be reliable. But with the corroded looking undercarriage and the weirdness with the mileage gauges I wonder if I truly have a new car.
It seems sturdy. The ride is smooth. I like the Bluetooth capability.
"Mod, aroundview camera"
No changes
"cruise control balencing, seat re-adjustment, appearance"
Nothing everything is great.
Surprisingly powerful.
Make sure there are no problems like this before the car is taken off the lot.  Maybe several people inspecting the vehicle before the customer receives it.
technology package and roominess
Making iPhones compatible with the phone an Bluetooth systems
Everything but the phone and Bluetooth
"I love the whole packge, the minor issues can be fixed."
Stop air leaks around windows
New style
Getting in and out of vehicle
"Transmission/ engine noise upon heavy acceleration, not bad, but for the price, could be better. Turning radius could be a little tighter. Hands free hatch open like Hyundai, and I should be able to exit vehicle with exit vehicle with hatch open (to unload vehicle) and lock the doors before my hands are full, and not have to unload the vehicle with my hands full, and wait for hatch to close to lock it at the hatch, my hands are full, plus I have to wait, not with Hyundai...  Small storage in frond of gear selector that is open, would be handy. Overall though, love this car!"
"Quiet, smooth, comfortable, pretty good gas mileage for a 6 cylinder. Lotsa features!"
The dealer experience was so bad there is not much else that can be done. I feel I was scammed. I'm on my 4th Nissan and will be my last from Jeff Schmidt.
The performance and handling.
The blind spots bother me even though i am alerted by the side lights. I still have the need for eye assurance. I was disappointed it did not come with the rear cargo cover considering the premium package we purchased and with the price of the car. We were originally informed we would get one with our purchase but found out later it was an added expense.
Its new and very sharp looking!
more usable storage on the drivers side
"the ride, how it looks and handles"
Get a better GPS system. There should be updates often not every two years. I bet you will charge me when an update is available.  The overall electronics are dated and additional features can be offered. There is no beep or alarm built-into the back camera. There is a lag in the acceleration as transmission shifts down.
handles very nice and is much quieter than earlier models. Exterior appearance is good and there is plenty of room inside.  Seats are very comfortable...the 9 way adjustment controls on the seat is a must.
"Everything is fine, no changes needed."
The interior is beautiful!
The interactive options with the radio and other features is not very intuitive.
"Quiet, comfortable ride.  Seats are very comfortable."
"The vehicle should not have left the manufacturer with a broken shock.  I lost an entire day, plus travel while they tried to figure it out."
"Looks, comfortable."
sunglass/glass storage was made smaller so my sunglasses no longer fit up there.  make it as big as my old 2010 Murano.
"quality, performance, comfort and new safety technologies."
"Having the all-encompassing camera view available on all of the different models of the Murano (now it's only available on models above the SV, I think) would be a great selling point.   I'm short so seeing how much room is available for manuevering on exterior of the passenger side would have been a great selling point for the model I purchased (I think it's an SV)."
My ex-husband and I have had 2 Nissans in the past.  Both were good quality product so what I LIKE most about my new Murano is that I have the same expectation for that as I have had for my past Nissans.
The seat is comfortable but not luxurious considering the model
The look inside and out
the room in the inside
lower end models need to have some items come as standard equipment. such as auto rear hatch opening and auto adjustment on seats and mirrors.
comfortable ride and ease of driving experience. seems to have plenty of getup and go. has gotten as high as 32.6 mpg.
Everything
I should have gotten the Platinum
Newness
I wish visibility were better from inside the vehicle. Having trouble adjusting to The Back-up Camera and strongly believe there should be a noise attached to help remind you that you are getting too close to something behind you. My Maxima has that noise and I find it excellent as a double check. Especially important because of visibility from inside is not that great. I wish there were more cup holders. Still trying to learn the navigation system. It seems hard to put addresses in and retrieve them.
It is the best looking SUV on the road.
Not a thing ! She's just Beautiful!
The ride is smooth and it's very roomy . The body of the car is just SEXY !
The front seats.
"sound system does not sound as crisp as the 2014  miss the automatic button to reset the backseat  miss the maintenance chart for tire rotation,oil change etc  put heated steering wheel back in the sl package and not the platinum"
gas milage is better but I think the gas tank is smaller so same milage per tank  full moon roof  comfortable seats
"Nothing, I love it!"
The molding of the exterior of the car - it gives it a very expensive look.
DRIVERS MONITOR SCREEN HAS FAR TO MUCH INFO AND CONFUSING.  LEAVE RADIO INFO ON MAIN RADIO SCREEN. MOVE COMPASS TO REAR VEIW MIRROR WHERE IT IS COMMONLY FOUND.
RIGHT SIZE. GREAT PAINT. BEAUTIFUL INTERIOR.
Nothing-it is great!!
The smooth ride!
"Love it  ,   this is my second Murano"
the AWD
Brand new vehicle some parts like paneling lose and moving looks like a cheep quality for a vehicle that costs 46k not as quiet as I would have thought little bit noisy.
Interior look and all power access
The nav system is far superior to my 2013 Passat and the car looks like is will go fast even when parked.
Gas mileage could be improved. Redesign of UBS power port in console.
Great redesign of car exterior. Interior is roomy. Nicely appointed. Zero gravity Seats are fantastic. I'm tall and long limbed the seat is very comfortable. Bose radio fabulous. Love the double sun roof. Back up cameras also a plus. The car is really fabulous. I can't say enough.
"With most vehicles now putting in wide center console, they begin to make the seat smaller. I'm 6'2"" and that's the only thing l dislike about the new Murano. The seat is not comfortable with part of my leg hanging over the side.."
The technology
Overall we are very satisfied with the vehicle.
Overall comfort and appearance.
Love the V6 but wish it got better mileage per gallon.
Comfort of seats and interior space for the driver.
Ride and style
"Not much.....I just still compare features to my past Ford Fusion and Acura RDX.   This is a good vehicle.....love the exterior design, but.....miss the ease of use of old RDX navigation...and just couple other NITS......    And....engine (transmission?).....sounds like a 4 cylinder.....no issues with performance, but just does not sound like a 6..."
Exterior look....
Great job with design. Love the vehicle
I love the interior appearance and technology of the options
Excellent car
"I've got a 2013 Altima that has an interior noise issue.  I made the assumption that three years later Nissan would have fixed that problem with their cars.  However, the problem is just as bad with this Murano.  When I ride with other people and hear how little road noise comes through it disappoints me that Nissan can't figure this out."
Height of vehicle and roomy interior.
"Rides nice, very comfortable"
The one area that needs improvement is fuel economy.  My prior vehicle was a Toyota Prius where I averaged more than 45 MPG so it is quite an adjustment to go to a vehicle that only gets 24-24 MPG.
I like the driving position - it sits up higher than a car so it is easier to get in & out and has very good visibility.
"Move the 12 volt outlet away from the cup holders so it is more realistic to use. Adjust the cup holders to allow different sizes of bottles/cups that are not as standard.  This is very important for road trips that happen often.  Please change the door bottle holder to a proper upright position. It will make it easier to remove the bottle without having to take eyes off the road.  If you correct the position you could also add in a second bottle holder.  Again, very nice for long drives. A material that doesn't retain lint/hair would be nice for cleaning purposes.  Why the hell are there spaces underneath the back seats? Its annoying to try and clean under there when small children have the ability to stick crap ANYWHERE! They have skills that drive me mad. I now have a small action figure I can't get out. Offer the garage door opener on the visor or near the sunglasses on multiple models.  Not all of us need/want/can afford the most expensive model for these things."
The whole point in switching vehicles was to get a sunroof and we do really like the speak system and XM radio in the Murano too.  Though at this point what I like is way less than what I have issues with.
"Love this vehicle, but I was a little disheartened about the scratches on the vehicle when we leased it. It was made right and the scratches were fixed, which I was very pleased with;)"
"It is a pretty vehicle, and drives great!!"
We are fully satisfied with the murano. Our only complaint is with the navigation system.
Smooth quiet ride & good economy on the highway.
Not much to be done.  This is our first Nissan and we are new to the style and make.
"I  believe and my wife also, think it is attractive and almost within our expectations for fuel economy.  We traded a 2015 Nissan Rogue for  the Murano and took a hit on gas mileage.  We wanted a littler bigger vehicle and the Nissan Murano seem to fit the requirement. We also like the safety feature (lane change) as it is very helpful."
appearance
The car rides beautifully so I would expect a beautiful sound system. The sales team performance was exceptional. Rodney is a wonderful addition to the Nissan team!!!
Push button start
"i am tremendously pleased with the vehicle. i just mentioned the clunk going from reverse to drive, just in case it's not normal. the transmission shifts so smooth going through the forward gears that i expected it to be just as smooth going from reverse to drive."
"style, color, technology. it is for my wife. she has talked about getting a Murano and nothing else for years. i couldn't afford a new vehicle. now i can and i got it for her. She loves it."
Not have recalls
Looks
sporty
"I like the sales person who sold us the car, but never received a survey to rate here."
The looks and comfort of the drive in the vehicle.
Dealer support   Exceptional ride
More descriptive owners manuall
The exterior look of it
It feels sturdy and is very comfortable.  I love the interior.
"The dealership has has bent over backwards to help us fix the issues we had. The console was the one that's taking longer to order. Why would the whole console be replaced if the only issue id the compartment door?    The other issue (paint scratch) was resolved in a very timely manner. Just a matter of scheduling the vehicle to have it fix.     Overall, the dealership, from the sales to service was excellent."
"SO far, my wife like everything on the vehicle. I do like the blind spot warning and the intelligent cruise control."
Make the noise go away
"Everything, except the noise"
The side mirrors have a reflection on them that sometimes make them difficult to see.  There are some pretty big blind spots but we are still getting used to using the technology that is designed to compensate for this.
"The look, ride, feel, and quality."
Everything !!!
I will be taking my vehicle to the dealership for help with the rattle.
"I like its roominess, and the warning light indicating a vehicle in the blind spot when passing. I also like the braking warning when approaching a vehicle too quickly."
"Just after purchasing the car, I received a postcard that there was an outstanding factory notice on the car.  This should have been addressed before I took delivery.     Also, I received a call in October to make my first scheduled maintenance appointment - for February! really?   TOO MANY SURVEYS."
The interior is lovely and unique.
I bought a 2016 murano Nissan and as I drove off the motor light turned on. Never has happened very upset and now to take it back again for the GPS. This will be my last Nissan. I buy
Ok

Solid ride
Better paint on exterior bird poop stained it got it off quickly too late it etched right in! Bought all kinds of products to no avail ???
I love it! Very comfortable I sit up high and not low to the ground! Plenty of room for my grandbabies.
"The options, technology,  and the styling."
"I love how it drives and also the size, it's not huge but fits just perfect."
Nothing that I can think of.
"The interior colors, sleek body, arrangement of dashboard."
I really don't have anything
My wife loves it
"I am disappointed in the overall quality vs the Infiniti I sold to buy the Murano.  Additionally, haven't been satisfied with the after sale support.  I inquired about the chrome/polished aluminum wheels at time of purchase to exchange with the 20"" wheels it came with and didn't hear anything after numerous calls to my parts contact - once I heard from them it was too late for an exchange.....now $2500 !!"
"Drives well, nice power, looks very nice."
"It's too new, I only have 2500 miles right now."
"Looks, power, and ride."
Sound system seems not to be stero.  Gas mileage really varies.
I love my new car.  Quiet roomy luxurious interior love looks of outside. Great safety features.
"Stability, quietness of ride"
fix the transmission .... they dealer told me to wait till I hit the 3k mileage mark first
style and comfort
"I love the design of the car, it's really sleek. I also love the panoramic sunroof and the chocolate leather!"
Larger storage in the back
New technology
Nothing yet
Appearance and the way it drives...very smooth engine and very powerful.
"Fuel efficiency, updated UI and android interoperability"
"Aesthetics, overall drive quality (acceleration, braking, cornering, handling)"
"For a base model, I am quite satisfied."
The ride and the style.
I would rather have the maxima if it was all wheel drive. The ride is truly awful
The external appearance
Roomier and style
Better gas mileage is a must.
Stylish look
Here is a list of features that would make this truly exceptional:  -Electronic Parking Brake  -Conventional transmission.  CVT takes too long to react.  -Start Button to behind the steering wheel.  Where it is at just doesn't make sense.  -A way to hide/undo the rear seat belts when the rear seats are down.  -Slight brighter interior lighting.
The seats are quite comfortable.  Also the center console storage is absolutely insane (in a good way).  The rear seats that recline.  The ease at which I can fold the rear seats down from the trunk.
change the trim around left and right air vents to black so they do not reflect in windows. talked to consumer affairs..they acknowledged the problem but said it was not a manufacturing defect.
rides nice...voice controls.
Love it
The intuitive cruise control   And how it holds the road  Like Velcro
Get rid of the cvt transmission.
"Comfortable, feel safe ,good ride"
Better view out the back window.

Lower the price
Comfort
I Love my Murano. I am planning to take my car to Nissan dealer svc department soon. I will be happy to let you know the result of my visit.
Comfortable seats and roominess.
I like the auto start button.
n/a
Improve wind noise while highway driving.  More useful front cargo areas.  Relocate hard to reach controls such as gas tank opener and heated/cooled seat controls while using console cup holders.  USB port more accessible.
"Great technology, beautiful interior and exterior, and very enjoyable to drive overall."
Fix the technology probelems
navigation
Nissan's reputation for reliability.   Seating is very comfortable for almost  80 ish folks.
No issues or problems
Everything I am a a repeat buyer
The look and ride
Fix the iPhone texting problem. This is my biggest issue.  Trip 2 Average MPG would be nice and very useful to me.  Location of console USB port and being able to close cover would also be nice but not that big of a deal.
"Looks, Seats, Memory Seats, and overall fit and finish. Currently on have 3,500 miles on it and that's why I haven't been in for service yet."
Storage space!!!
Safety features such as lights that tell you when a car is in your blind spot
Front end collision standard  option
Interior
"So far, the estimated miles per gallon is less than expected."
"Looks and features.  We traded in a 2013 Murano, and our 2016 Murano has features that I love that our 2013 did not."
power liftgate was not functioning properly but is being taken care of by dealer.  Very happy with vehicle
"Mileage is poor. I am averaging 17.6 mpg and I am not an aggressive driver. I purchased this vehicle based on Nissan's advertised mileage of 21 mpg for local driving and am very disappointed.    Overall, the quality of the vehicle is very good."
Interior is very comfortable. Styling is growing on me.
Seat Need to be adjustable in a up and down.
It drives smooth make good turns and lot of space .
"Although our new car is quieter than our old one, I was actually more comfortable in the older vehicle.  This is particularly true in the front passenger seat, where the old car had more adjustments than the new one.  I would love to be able to adjust seat height so I stop hitting my head when entering if not driving.  Not sure why, but it seems to have less storage space in interior and rear baggage area, even though car seems to be about same size."
"More quiet than old one; uses regular gas; colors are nicer (old one was silver with black leather--nice, but not as rich-looking).  It drives well in general, and, hopefully will give us many years of good service like our last Murano."
The automatic braking system safety feature would be nice to have as part of the navigation package or otherwise standard in one of the packages I purchased.
"Smooth ride, attractive exterior and exterior, great, GREAT camera angles showing what is in front. I also love the blind spot alert system!"
"Gas engine is not near as quiet as I feel it should be.  It sounds cheap, loud, not unlike a diesel - which it is not.  Also, the gas economy is not what was expected. In fact, the 1015 Murano I traded in got BETTER gas economy than this 2016 Hybrid.  I should have kept my 2015 Murano."
"Rides well, hand-tooled leather interior is outstanding, comfortable seats, plenty of leg room."
More storage area in the cargo area.
New features and overall look.
Everything
Nothing
Comfortable
"It would  be nice to have a usb connector more easily accessible, possibly by the 12v.  One of the ones up front is difficult  to get my arthritic fingers on."
Very comfortable the right size very roomy good leg room easily to drive and most of all my wife loves
"1. a. The electronics need work - Bluetooth volume automatically varies from loud to quiet.    b. I wish I had more control over the controls...in my last car I could even change the voice of the navigation.    c.  If certain options are not available when the car is in motion, let us know rather than just dimming the screen.    2. There are some sharp edges in the car.  Upon pickup I cut my finger on one of them.  Bled a LOT.    3.  The headrests should be the kind that can be adjusted forward and then ""snapped back""....this would be great for people w/neck issues.      Other than that...I love my new Murano!"
"the style, both interior and exterior....and the features (although they can be improved - more depth / variability).    It's comfortable and has a GREAT ride quality / feel."
More powerful engine.
The interior design.
Make the seats a bit more comfortable
Mostly everything.  I can't say I am not happy with the vehicle.
"Lot of blind spots,  When backing up the side mirrors tilt too much for the camera then you can't look in the mirror to see whats on the side. I've decided best NOT to use camera. I have difficulty backing out of tight spots. which  I never did before .  The over hang on the back window causes a lot more dust to collect on window.  I'm trying to improve the adjustment of the side mirrors to help but huh.."
"The ride, the looks, the storage and backdoor automatic, seats"
"Better follow up by the dealership.  We have made several calls about issues that are unresolved.  A letter to Nissan North America - Customer Service has helped as far as what can be Nissan can do.  However, even the customer service representative did not get returned calls from my dealer - Nissan Pohanka of Salisbury, MD.  Major issues still unresolved are access to One to One Rewards and Extended Vehicle Service Contact.  It is not 11 weeks since our purchase.    Case was closed for #24336875."
"We love the styling, options and the ride.  The styling appears to be similar to at least 10 other makes of crossovers on the market today, but the Nissan has more distinctive designs.   The options go beyond our expectations and have been a pleasure using them.  The ride with the 20 inch wheels and the suspension, plus sound proofing has improved our trips and friends comment often about it as well."
Just how comforeal it is
LOOKS
"The problem we encountered with our brakes was the recall and that was taken care of efficiently. We received a letter telling us of a potential problem.  As we were planning to  take a trip, I did not want to wait for a second letter.  The dealer had a diagnostic test which indicated there was a problem.  We took the car in when the part arrived and it has worked very well over since.  I previously owned 2 Lexus 350 SUVs and my husband and I like the Murano much better, that should make your day!"
"The safety features are really most helpful, the blind spot indicator, parking assists, and the good vision with the front and back windows. The gas mileage is excellent, the handling of the car, wonderful."
Update your navigation system. Make the display screen and maps easier to read and understand. Fix the timing on the voice prompts for directions.
"It is a stylish car with well-appointed amenities. It seems safe, handles well and is comfortable and reliable."
I can't think of anything at this time.
The luxurious feel of the inside and the exterior design. I also love the amenities
"Hopefully when I take my vehicle for the first oil change and tell them about the whistling noise on the driver's window, this will be taken care of.    I have been driving Nissan for a long time, so I have high expectations on customer service performance.  Hopefully this experience will be a good one.    Thanks,"
Everything is well designed and like the sporty look of the SUV
Warning if seat belt is not connected.   Also on the drivers side seat at the bottom there is a plastic guard that sticks out about an inch that keeps hitting my leg which is very annoying. Also should have the option of back up sensors which I was told that my vechile had. I was very disappointed since I purchased the platinum because I was told it had that feature.
Great looking easy to use.
The exterior styling
I love my new vehicle!!
Easy to drive and roomy. Seats are very comfortable.
Good
The room
Color and style
There are two areas that could be improved:  1 - Navigation system doesn't seem to depict traffic accurately.  I have compared it to Waze and Maps in real time and they are both much more accurate with the actual traffic conditions.  2 - Visibility is somewhat restricted compared to other cars that I have driven.
It rides very well and I am pleased with the overall value of the purchase.
Technology and options
Have terrible experience with Nissan service and Nissan customer service. I will never buy a Nissan again.
The way it looks
tint the windows
Noise while driving is very excessive.
"Interior, safety features, transmission and handling."
It has been great
I love our new Murano
Nothing
Interior roominess and sound system
"2016 model Murano seems quieter inside than 2014 model, but would continue  to improve on reducing road noise."
"I like the transmission, smooth shifting."
Can't think of anything to improve this vehicle.
The cargo space is great.
If the few things I am having issues with were not there
safety features
Acceleration is a bit slower and engine noise louder that comparable models.  Maybe engine is undersized.
Comfortable ride; safety features; attractive exterior; good sound system; easy navigation package; a lot to recommend it.
Can't think of a thing.  I am very satisfied
The comfort of the interior while driving long distances
"Improve gas mileage.The ride could be a little softer. Road bumps and potholes are a bit jarring. Redesign the hood so that that bent part facing the driver/passenger isn't so prominent. Use a leather finish that does not attract dirt - it has an almost tacky feel to it. Please have a pocket that will fit plus sized phones on the console. Cup holders on console should be a bit larger, Will not fit an actual coffee cup. The sound system is just not that good - not rich enough and does not give a surround sound. NO amount of playing with the balance helps. Not sure how many speakers are in this model but I've heard better sound systems in cheaper cars. The NAVIGATION system is awful. Too many prompts to make a simple phone call. Navigation map design is very poor. Compare to WAZE or even Siri. The company Nissan is using is unacceptable."
Beautiful interior design and colors (tan with gold/silver accents) and accent lighting. Great exterior design to lights and side panels/ metal creases - all look good and hard to tell from a Lexus. Front seats are nice and roomy (could raise a little higher for the driver). Great leg room for rear passengers. Smooth transmission. Very little engine or wind noise.
Better paint!!!!
Driveability
I don't really like the ride with the low profile tires
Looks and performance
Looks extremely high end at a great price!
Made blind spot warning standard equipment
"All things interior ie: seats, noise, looks, ride"
"My biggest issue was the dealership and purchase process. Very, very dissatisfied and will never purchase another Nissan. Have talked to a supposed Regional rep. and got no help. Nissan does not care!! Would have never been treated like this by GM. My mistake and huge lesson learned."
"There are qualities about this car I like, and I hope to one day settle in to enjoy it."
many of the items I indicated can not be fixed since they are design problems.  Others will have to be addressed when I bring in the vehicle for its first servicing.
Appearance...feeling of security...generous cargo space.
I need to know what can be done to resolve the spot on the dash.  The natural finish is a dulled beige color but now it has two lighter shiny spots on it.
I love the way it drives.  The seating is extremely comfortable.
The cup holders need to be changed back to horizontal as the previously were in 2011 model. Wind noise is the biggest complaint I hear from other owners.
The technology package and the exterior design.
The looks and features.
"the quality of the vehicle for the price we paid is very disappointing.  new transmission within 400 miles. after dealership had vehicle for 8 days you would think they would try to make us happy by detailing the vehicle or filling it up with fuel.  after we picked it up and called them the next day then they offered to do so.  its the fact we had to ask them to do it, as a dealer they should care enough about the customer to do these things to go above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied.  just like most places, we felt like we were just a number, they sold us a vehicle so it didn't matter then.    phone will not stay connected to entertainment system. few days after purchase had to return to dealer to sign paper work they had screwed up.  what is there about this that makes it an enjoyable or an acceptable vehicle.  plan is to get rid of vehicle as soon as financially able to do so and plan is to NEVER own a Nissan again."
Exterior looks
I would prefer the lock engage when I go to drive not 25 mph
"WOW - I am not sure.  I am still learning all the features. I traded in my 2010 Murano -(nearly 150,000 miles!) for this one.  I really can't think of anything right now that I don't like!"
"I LOVE the Smart Cruise Control! As a busy Realtor, I am in the car a lot - and am often interrupted or distracted.  This feature helps keep me safe!  I also really enjoy the built in navigation and the Bluetooth for my phone."
better tires
looks
It has a recall on the ABS system but no timing on the repair.
Size & comfort
The interior- very comfortable and attractive
Miles per gallon increase
appearance
Great ride!!!  love the looks too!!!
We had a Jetta with diesel engine so going from that super economical car to one that only get 24 mpg is still a shock.  But I do enjoy driving the car and I knew it would not get the gas mileage that my Jetta got.
"It's roomy and handles nice, looks good too."
Blind spots in the rear corners.
Great to drive
smooth driving
Leather could be better
Leather could be better
Exceptionally smooth ride and. No road noise
my wife and i love our Murano. the little bit of wind noise is really all that has bothered us on our trips. Not sure if there could be a different way to seal the sunroof to make sure it doesn't get water around it on the inside . Not sure if this is possible since there is a hole in the roof. Excellent product.
"My wife loves the heated seats most of all. i love the navigation, the weather, hands free phone, leather seats, heated seats. the pick up the engine has, the gas mileage we are getting, 29.9 hwy 24.3 city. we love the Murano. very pleased."
Push button trunk  Cooled seats
Add side lights on each side when turn signal is on. Trouble seeing when turning.
This is our second Murano.  We had no trouble with our first one for five years.
I would like it if the doors unlocked automatically when you put the vehicle in park at all times
comfort and space
nothing right now everything is ok
everything
Improve fuel economy
Interior comfort and it's gorgeous
No improvements needed
"Looks, handling, comfort"
"Have some wind noise at speed, but otherwise an excellent choice.  We've had for 3 months and have over 6k miles."
Noise reduction would be good.    In heavy rain the wiper drives the water off the driver side front window but then to driver side window blocking the view of the driver side mirror.  Especially on the interstate to the point where the side mirror is of no value.  I have never seen this before. Quite unexpected.
It is a beautiful car and well appointed.  It runs quite nicely.  The seats are fantastic and expecially good on long drives i.e. 5 plus hours still feel great!
Already have recall
Driving comfort
"Some off reason my engine picture light came on. I did take it in to my nisson dealer...said they did not have  The 2016 program yet to figure out why that light was on.  I would think the new programs would come out when the new cars come in.  Even though few problems occur the first year, there is a few exeptions.  So maybe you will listen to this customer and do Something about this.@n"
Cool looking...bad ass attitude looking car!!!
I wish there were more controls with the sun roof. (Control the amount the windows opens along with the sliding roof.  The sliding roof must be open entirely before you can open or vent the sun roof glass.
I like all the safety features. ( The all around camera and all the alerts.)
"The Murano is pretty heavy, so in case of an accident the vehicle would provide substantial protection for anyone inside the vehicle. My wife really likes the fact that she sits up high compared to other vehicles. She also likes the roominess."
"Roominess,  gas mileage"
No complaints.
It seems like my Altima has a bigger fuel tank than my new Murano
looks ride and power
Lights could be brighter.  Maybe I'm not used to how heater operates or weather is not real cold yet but it doesn't seem like heater gets real warm. Heated seats are nice.
"Very comfortable, rides well, and is quiet. Car is very attractive. Love the color. We looked at several cars and seems like red, black, silver, and white are all that is offered on lots. Except Jeep, they have lots of colors. Almost bought a Jeep Renegade Safari. But am happy with Murano."
"I absolutely love my Murano. It stands out when compared to competitor models, it's sleek & curvy. The others are more square oriented. The only flaws I see in the design are lighting issues & few tweeks with tech aspects. The dealership however, is another story."
"Curvy sleek look & safety features. My kids, heated back seat. They also want cooling seat back there."
"Everything, I absolutely LOVE my Murano!"
The way it drives
looks and no turbocharger.
"My wife wanted me to buy a Lincoln MKX - I'm only 64 - not old enough to drive an MKX if you get my drift.  I wanted a vehicle that was sporty, great looking, comfortable, luxurious, drove well, braked well, with ample electronics - I got it - the Nissan Murano - now get my wife off my case!"
Everything.
Safety features
It is very annoying that the bluetooth volume issue has been a known issue for at least 8 months. Other owners reported it and were told that the issue was being worked on. In September I was told that Nissan was just learning about the issue. I paid a lot of money for a vehicle with a feature that is very important to me that does not function.  Please fix it.
Quality of interior.
Just  have remote start more responsive
Comfort ride and drive
"I would say lose some of the plastic .. example, chrome-like near grill and use a metal; .. the molding around the bottom of the car - 'know why it's there and is for sure functional; maybe a little more room in the cargo space - for sure it'd compromise some of the second row seating space [they are very spacious] but I'd trade that for more room in the cargo]."
body design .. handling on the highway .. seats are indeed quite comfortable .. overall pretty good mileage
"the steering has more play in it than I am used to; it would be nice to be a little more responsive.  Also, I would like to have a windshield washer on the back window. It would be helpful in the upper Midwest winters, as the calcium chloride on the roads is difficult to remove with just the wiper."
"The controls are very intuitive, and the cameras outstanding! The seats are very comfortable."
Storage compartments are just weird those in the door are too small and the console is real big.  Need medium and small storage compartments
Appearance
The LED dim headlights are just not right for driving on hills which is the main thing that I believe should be fix. Also the defrost needs to work better!
Love the seat comfort which is why we switched from a chevy traverse to a Murano. Also the overall look of the vehicle is another plus.
"The ride, heated/air seats, drivers assist warnings"
Have not owned it long enough to give a fair answer.
"comfortable seats, gas milage"
"Garage door opener buttons on rear view mirror are not lighted and are very hard to find at night.    Don't care for split screen while backing up car, full screen would be better."
"It's a very good looking car, inside and out."
"The ride is nice, quiet."
"I love my new Murano, but it would be nice if power seats were standard. For the price of the vehicle, it seems like that feature should be standard."
The new body style! It is so sleek and beautiful. The interior is also very nice.
Its a smooth ride and I love that it is rated high safety-wise.
"Back window is difficult to squeegee clean under the ""fin""."
Dashboard and ride comfort
No suggestions
"Fuel economy, size, ease of operation"
I love my car. The inability to use the push button start at times is frustrating. I have to play around with locking/unlocking the car to get it to recognize my key fob and start the engine when pushed.
The car's ability to slow down automatically when getting close to another vehicle ahead.
Better mapping system.
Would like auto dimming on side mirrors. Interior and engine noise a little loud. A little more tilt on the front driver's seat. Speech to text recognition would be nice and the ability to make custom responses to text messages. When replying to a text message you have to take your eyes off the road to many times to accept and respond to a text message. Truly not hands free text messaging.
"Exterior and interior design, engine power, heated seats, navigation, AWD, interior room, safety tech features!!!  Overall I just love this car!!!"
"The Murano interior looks very nice...except that the leather gets scuffed/stained/marked easily.  We have an 8 yr old car (another manufacturer) also with black leather interior that still looks great.  I don't know if there is a difference in the quality of the leather or perhaps the type of finish of the leather, but it's more than disappointing that the new Murano already has scuffs and apparently, stains."
"Drives well, has many nice features, nice styling."
Improve gas mileage
The look
The only issue I seem to have is when on blue tooth for phone call the other persons volume goes up and down without touching anything.
The looks
"The vehicle is very pretty, fuel economy is good.  The transmission doesn't shift well trying to take off in a hurry.  Living in a state that requires handsfree the bluetooth not connecting on a more regular basis and NissanConnect taking a long time to connect is really annoying."
The appearance
Nothing really.
"Everything, this is our 4th Murano!"
Nothing
Comfort
How it handles and the smooth ride.
How the car shifts
Body style -  platinum pkg
I can't think of anything. I love it.
it's comfortability
Exterior paint needs to be redone.
Make seat belts easier to get to. Fix reflexion problem in side rear view mirrors
"Interior seats, drivability"
Improve fuel economy.
"It's comfortable, rides smoothly, & looks gorgeous!"
The size of it.
Comfort
fix the Nissan emblem on the grill
it is a real dependable vehicle
I really don't know. I went from an Armada to a Rogue then to the Murano and have always been a satisfied customer. I've only made 1 payment on the car and I am frustrated every time I drive it.
The appearance
More standard features
Stylish and safe
"Love my Nissan Murano, until  now I have always driven a Ford. But I did a lot of research and decided the Murano was the best one for me."
The way it handles on the road and the ease of parking.
A little better on the road noise would be nice.
Interior is so nice. Very luxurious
"I love the seats,radio,and the sleek design"
Nothing
Technology is superb
Left rear window/door seal is the only issue in an otherwise exceptional vehicle.
electronics!
"This is my second murano.  While a lot of the enhancements I was looking for have been made with the new model design, there are three things I would suggest.  For the sun visors in the front seats, add an extender that slides out.  When the sun is beating down on the driver's side, the sun visor isn't long enough to cover the entire window.  It would be nice if the cargo cover would fold back like it did in the prior model (love the extra space in the cargo area).  And third, have brighter lights that turn on in the front area by the rearview mirror - they are pretty dim."
"It's hard to narrow down one thing as I love my murano.  I like all the driver seat options, the # of programmable SXM stations, and the backup camera views.  I also like the protective warning notifications."
The only thing that I truly think needs work is the sound system.
I love how comfortable it is.
In the shop 4 out of first 6 weeks we had it. Don't send out your vehicles with defects. We buy new vehicles to avoid trouble. Our time is valuable. This experience was the worst ever experienced with a new car. Nissian has lost our business. Between my wife and I the number of Nissian's purchased is over 10. You lost our business.
Look
"The roominess,the lines and shape of the body and the interior design. The smoothness of the transmission and the handling."
Update the navigation system to STOP diverting me from the direct route to my destination.
My wife likes the way it handles.  She has less problems with this vehicle than the 2013 Pathfinder
Some of the features are complicated to use.  Would love them to be easier and more intuitive.
I am more comfortable in it than I was in my Maxima.
Smooth run
The illuminated metal door scuf plates dented very easily from getting in and out of the vehicle.
Style. Mpg. Functionality. Reliability. Technology.
"I actually feel alright about the vehicle, because Douglass Nissan is outstanding in satisfying the customers.  This is actually the fifth Nissan for me.  I guess that speaks for itself."
It is a beautiful car first of all.  It rides smoothly and the technology of the vehicle is so neat.
My navigation doesn't find some of the addresses I try to put in. Would not let me select S main st in Houston tx which should be a common address or State Hwy 361 in Port Aransas tx. Some sorta bug there and I noticed blower on air conditioner seems to cut out for a min or so before kicking back in.
Thinks it's beautiful! I love the exterior design and inside I love the oyster shell accents. It also handles well. I love the all around camera so I can see if there is anything below my line of vision I might hit like small child or animal or something laying in drive way.
Only negative was dealing with the sales people.  They tried everything to try to get me to pay more for the vehicle than I had to.
"Compared to the Jeep we traded in, it was better in overall quality plus more power and better gas mileage."
Nothing
Sporty and roomy
"The only thing I wish the package included is power side windows.  I had them on my Maxima, and was surprised and disappointed they weren't included in my new Murano."
I like the overall comfort and convenience.
"the only issue is a blind spot in backing up or changing lanes.  could be redesigned, somewhat."
just about everything
Customer followup
"I have a 2010, which shifts smoother, accelerates faster, has a better armrest storage area, and better visor.  The new one is way prettier, has better lighting, nicer interior, better stereo, steering wheel controls, plus has less miles than what I put on my 2010. I love it!"
"Paint color!!!  Electronics, Bluetooth, phone controls with steering wheel and navigation."
It's looks
The passenger side seat needs to be an 8 way seat for all the murano veh the seat rides to high.
The looks.
The placement of the oil stick is very difficult to use.  Because of the angle always feels like the stick is getting bent up when being replaced.  Side panels on the car feel a little thin and cheap.  Wish the car had a little less chrome accent.  Overall very nice.
The seats are very comfortable.  It rides smooth - hardly feel the shifting.  The fuel economy is great.  The dashboard controls are set up nicely.
Space inside.  Design inside and outside. Navigation system. Powerful engine.
"Well, the Glendale dealer took my previously leased Murano as a trade in (12 month lease left and they bought it.) I told them I've paid the Sep 2016 payment already and they said I will get a refund but never happened. Called the Nissan Motor Acceptance and they will not get involved. So the dealer didn't not give me the refund. Can you help?"

Once the repairs are made on the car which we are waiting for the parts I am hoping to love my car again.

"Opening and closing of the car doors do not have the premium feel; while equipped with blind spot monitor and warning, blind spot mirror would still be desired; apps offered in the infotainment system are too limited; integration of Apple carplay is desirable; lane departure warning and lane keep assist are highly desirable. Audible parking warning for distance, pedestrian warning would be helpful."

The Interior Technology
"I have driven Nissan's all my life. In the Murano, the ventilation system tends to be noisy with lots of fan noise.  Plus the cooling seat is noisy.   There is also road noise especially through the driver's door/window."
"My Murano is a very firm, secure ride.  I love the navigation system, phone system, large screen, etc."
Nothing as of now
"I wish it had better acceleration.  Our last vehicle was a KIA OPTIMA, and the turbo acceleration was outstanding.  The Murano can reach good speed, but it's slow to engage and speed up. That's my main complaint and disappointed with the vehicle."
I have always loved the body style of the Nissan Murano  - I have wanted one since they first came on the market - she's a beauty!!
My 98 4.0 wrangler gets the same mileage so that could be improved. A little sound proofing could help.
Feels like a sports car with SUV utility.
Fix the the sunroof shade problem
"Ride, comfort, power"
"Improve the handling, stability and suspension."
"The size, roominess and power."
The style of the car. The look
I love my Murano
I feel road noise could be better. The door drink holders are awkward and water bottles do not fit well. At night I cannot see the Homelink buttons to push them. At night the ventilated seat buttons aren't lighted to know which direction to turn them for heat vs. cool.
I have owned Nissan's in the past and I trust the brand. I love the way my Murano looks sporty and feels luxurious.
"Still in break-in stage but transmission automatic shifting seems lagging - goes over 3K rpms before shifting to next gear starting from 0, smoother when transitioning to higher gears.    More road noise than expected but acceptable"
"Exterior design, comfortable interior, simple dashboard design and controls, ample stogage and passenger space.  Recommend driver safety assist option, very helpful."
Nothing

nothing.  So happy with my new vehicle
"smooth ride, great electronics and looks."
I thought gas mileage would be better...
easy to get in and out of  overall nice vehicle
Driver's right armrest can be moved a little farther out.
The ride.
"As I have said we were very upset that the service men had removed the tires on two different occasions, rebalanced them and then finally replaced them with no improvement, but we knew the car was not riding correctly.  Finally, a parts and service supervisor named JP Fennessy at Somersworth Nissan, NH found the problem and replaced the drive shaft -"
"I have really enjoyed driving several Murano cars and now I will continue to do so.  They are good looking, have a good reaction when you step on the gas pedal,  and very nice interior which is roomy.  They come with great added features and I especially like the lights that let you know there is another vehicle  coming up beside you. The bose system is great.  People have stopped me to ask if I am happy with my Murano and I tell them I love it and this is my third one."
I have already shared my only issue with the car.
I like the smooth ride and cabin quietness for the value.
"other than correcting some of the blue tooth connection issue ,this is a very fine automobile"
everything
Need better quality control my windshield molding was. It installed properly now I .lneed the windshield taken out and molding replaced. Dealer isn't offering any kind of compensation. Very annoyed new vehicle should have been caught at quality control or dealer pre sale ch for list
Style performance room
Wish seats move back when exiting vehicle
My 4th murano...I like it a lot... style interior
"1. Some of the angles of the body often create reflections in the side mirrors and windshield.  2. Emergency braking should have pedestrian detection  3. Moving object detection should stop vehicle when backing up, not just warn - it takes time to understand what the warming mean  4. Blind spot monitor light should be on the mirror  5. Sound parking assist would be very helpful  6. Parallel parking assist ( a la Ford) would be very nice to have"
"I like overall package, features, the way the car stands out, the way it drives, that it doesn't have third seat that I don't need."
I can't think of anything. I love my car!
"Appearance, fuel economy, navigation system, remote start, heated seats, smooth drive, and it is extremely comfortable."
style and space
Comfort. Easy to handle. Auto Start
Interior comfort
Could get better mileage.  Otherwise very satisfied with the vehicle
Carpet instalation
quality
Ride and the style
Handling is very smooth and engine has good power for a crossover/SUV
everything.
My only complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to see over the top of the hood because of the way it's designed.  I have difficulty parking within lines because of this.
"I love how the smooth the ride is.  It does not feel like I am driving an SUV.  Also, the braking system is smooth as well.  I love the quietness of the engine.  Also, I like the way the entertainment screen is designed and especially the navigation system.  It s comfortable and roomy inside. Most of all, I love the look of the Murano.  It's a beautiful looking SUV especially in white!"
Overall appearance and interior quality.
design-window glare from polished surfaces in the vehicle  navigation-update the software prior to delivery (at no cost)  carpeting-don't sell vehicles with obvious rips in carpet
it starts up every day
I wish the technology safety package was the same as on my husband's Infinity Q50S Technology package
"Ride, comfort, looks"
The ride
Figure out what needs to be done so the engine won't rev so high at startup.    Paint problem has been repaired by the dealer collision shop and did a great job.
"Comfort and ride quality, fuel mpg."
"Overall, love the new car, but the squeeks that developed in the first month are really annoying and took the luster off of the new purchase too quickly.  I don't want to have to go to the dealer multiple times in the first couple of months."
Interior comfort/appearance is wonderful!
Get better gas milage
"Smooth drive, great seats"
Would be good to have passenger lumbar support  A cargo restraining system similar to the Cadillac XT5 would be welcome
The exterior styling.  The all around camera system.  The touch screen.
Power lift hatchback
The ride
engine could have more power
nice riding
"Fix the basic electronic issues with the Bluetooth calling and pairing, as well as the pressure switch on the passenger seat for the air bag sensor.  Either fix the Nissan Connect, change the marketing to be accurate, or stop the poor development and execution of onboard software and move to using android auto and apple car play for navigation and apps."
"Interior comfort and design, cabin quietness, smooth ride and handling."
I don't like the wind noise and I am disappointed it does not have LED headlight. My SL was almost as much as the Platinum
powe. Richness of interior
Nothing
"The light that indicates another vehicle passing me starts flashing too late for my comfort.  With my previous vehicle a 2015 Subaru much more warning was given when another car was approaching.  I hope this can be adjusted when I bring the car in for service.  I'm keeping a list of minor concerns that I hope can be addressed,"
Appearance and adequate comfort and roominess.
"Improve graphics on center console display, to match display in instrument panel. Resolution is average."
"Smooth ride, comfort"
Mileage is less per gallon than expected and I already received a recall notice.
"Moon roof, roomy interior, handling & ride, sharp looking exterior, good sound system."
"This is a beautiful car . . .we love it. It does ride a bit harder than the 2012 Murano I traded in, but the car is well appointed and Lancaster Nissan, Rod Arndt, and the service department are stellar to deal with. The electronic sun roof is a bit difficult to operate because it never just wants to just open without opening the windows."
"What can I say about this beautiful machine? I have had Nissans in the past, purchased a 2012 Platinum a year ago and it was such a beauty, then traded it in on this beautiful 2016 Platinum. The care is so well appointed, the sound system, the heating cooling system, the seats, all of it is exceptional."
I love it!
The technology. Especially the gps
"I thought that I had the rear backup package, but apparently I do not.  I was a little upset about this."
I am very happy about the way my vehicle looks and handles.
"I would like to have access to Apple Car.  Also, I can't dictate text message with my iPhone."
"I love the safety features.  Especially, I love the 360 degree view on the screen."
technology....smooth ride
Wifi would be nice. The trial period was longer on my dodge
Navigation and  moon roof
Was expecting Bose sound system and auto trunk lift bc that's what I had in my    Last murano of the same Model . Disappointed that tow capacity went down.
Handles bumps much better. Great smooth ride. Most comfortable seats. ESP for someone with back prob
"Improve fuel economy; redesign interior (or just go back to the previous model) to make accessing the glove box easier, put back the sun visor extension; improve sound for vehicles with the Bose system."
"The exterior is lovely, and when it's functioning, I enjoy the Bluetooth connectivity.  I also like the keyless entry, and automatic start"
Bluetooth does not always connect.  Still learning the climate control and how to best set for comfort.
comfort
There is a slight hesitation when I initially place in drive and accelerate.  I plan to have my local dealership check when I go in for my first check up.
I love the look and feel of the vehicle.  It drives very well  and the seats and extremely comfortable.
Retractable cover should be discounted along with back mats
Everything I just love my  Nissan Murano
Safety/Technology
Nothing at this point.
Features and drive/handling
I don't like the way the automatic heater/air conditioning works.
The way it handles while driving
The safety features included - 360 camera - blind spot indicator - assisted braking
Remote start good seats
We love our Murano.. 2nd purchase. I am disappointed that when we bought the car we were not alerted to the recall that could cause a fire... We would have waited but still purchased the car once you have the problem fixed. We first heard about the recall a few days after we purchased it... on the internet..    Our Sales professional was great... Steve. He was the best and we will go back to him... but Nissan knew of this problem and did not address this on the front end. If it were a small recall... well... but for us to have to worry about a fire and as now outlined by the mailing that we received... it could burn a house down if left in a garage... well... The car runs great and we are fans of Nissan... but the communications of this recall was not handled well.
The car is great and we enjoy the driving experience.
The way it drives and the exterior design
Try to make the in city gas mileage a little higher
there needs to be an adjustment for the driver's seatbelt to move it down for comfort.  The knobs located on the dash below the navigation/menu screen need to be moved to underneath the screen as the position they are currently in is hard to use due to lack of space between the knobs and the shift knob.
"The ride, the quietness in the cabin, the comfort of the seats, the driving experience, the bells and whistles are wonderful!  this is my 3rd Nissan, I love the product"
more mileage per thank
Safety features - the looks
I just got a recall notice after having my car only a couple weeks which made me less than happy I will take it in and have it looked at but I certainly hope that in the future it won't have too many recalls
I love the smooth ride of the Nissan Murano I like all the techie things that I'm so touchscreen and the sound system is wonderful I just like everything about my new car
the interior
"Interior finishes are beautiful, but plastic.  Compartment in middle console broke within a week."
"Everything.  Previous car was a convertible, so nice to sit up higher and very quiet.  Love this car."
Quiet ride and good styling
"I drove the car the first time Monday Nov 21 at night low beams shine about 10 feet in front of the car,you couldn't see. Had to drive with high beam on.  44 thousand for the car and no low beams.   I drove the car from Myrtle Beach SC to New Jersey with no low beams.  Very stressful.  Thank You  Lee Edwards  612 Sabel Springs Way  Myrtle Beach SC. 29588  Phone 843-215-6928  Lnedwards1@verizon.net"
The ride and seats.
"I love this vehicle.  If any improvements could me made, I suggest:  Better cloth material on the seats.  (it seems a little ""cheap"" to me)  A brighter ""white"" exterior color.  (see Toyota white)"
"I love the modern, sleek design of the exterior AND the interior.  Great gas mileage."
I absolutely love the interior. I did choose the tan leather seats.  They do seems to soil quite easily.
I love the way the car looks and drives. It seems to handle all road conditions very well.  I think it is the most attractive crossover on the road today!
Cargo space in the back could be a little larger.  Could use some metal hooks in the cargo area to attach bungee cords for securing items. Also technology should indicate if I am drifting into another lane.
"Inferior comfort, ride quietness and appearance."
"nothing, so beautiful"
size
More mileage per gallon is always a plus
"I like everything about my new vehicle. It comfortable,smooth riding and gorgeous to the eye"
Higher quality carpeted floor mats would be nice.  For the price they seem cheap and are wearing already...
The comfort and handling
My wife and I love the car and would not be able to come up w/ an improvement suggestion.
"Unique style, appearance, technology, comfort. Excited about planning our first road trip."
More space and more variety of interior colors to choose.
"Vehicle Power, soft driving."
"It has excellent visibility, looks stylish, and rides comfortably."
"Visibility is poor, due to wide, large door beams and low roof line. Cars especially to your right at 4-way stop can not be seen. Also, curb to your right can not be seen.  Driver must be too reliant on technology (360 camera and blind spot warning) for safety, which could distract him from looking straight ahead while driving. Sama applies when making left turns.....obstructed vision due to thick door beams and low roof line."
"Very stylish and attractive..,.smooth v-6 engine, beautiful interior.....could be leg roomier."
There is not enof space for storage of stuff used often enof. Not enof nor large enof. For instance front seat door storage not wide enof. Is all wasted space in front turned into storage?  Least amount in last 3 cars:  CR-v n Navagator-1998
Roominess in back seat for passengers like our Navagator. Great driving  Modern safety features were best features for purchase  Just need more front seat storage for me
I absolutely love my car!!
"The roominess, color and style."
No complaints.  Loving the Murano and very happy with my choice.
The way it drives and all the features included in the Platinum model.
"Heated seats, hatch auto open and close, sound system"
There is nothing I can think of this is an exceptional vehicle and it has a lot of technology and a lot to learn how to efficiently operate this vehicle. I love it.
"Everything,I like it as it is."
Everything is good.
I like everything.
Window Tint  Film protection for headlights  Rear bumper over hatch opening!    Weather tech floor & cargo mat    Sun Shade Cover
Design of body  Artic Blue Metalic Paint  Wheels  All Wheel Drive
My wife loves the car.  She rarely lets anyone else drive it.  The only way to improve the car is to maybe sell it a little cheaper.
I love how much room it has.  It is very quiet to drive.  The sound system is excellent.  I like the look also.
Extremely satisfied
Awesome power extremely comfortable
A few more cup holders or storage spots in front
I love it. The rear lift gate is not able to open with the remote. Difficult to open at times. Should have remote standard in my opinion.
"The interior room, the pick up, and the exterior."
interior lighting is not so great.  I have a hard time seeing the remote garage door button when it is dark outside
the safety and warning items when driving
Technology
Nothing
Solid feeling - safe for family feeling
Blinding glare from the elevated part of the hood nearest windshield.
Comfort
Wy wife love her new murano!
Perfect size great options good gas for v6
Gps
"It is minor; however, a little more range of support with the low back pump in the drivers seat would be useful."
"It is an exceptional vehicle in looks, operation and handling."
Comfort & Style
"handling and stability seem just ok, more small storage spaces would be nice as not easy places up from for cell phones and sunglasses for 2 people, no cup in back seat.   In case not later in survey our most notable disappointment compared to our past Acura is the front lights; much inferior to what we had.  Cant see as far as wide so dark when we turn at night."
"very comfortable, quiet, good balance of power and gas mileage, reasonable price, exterior condition"
Murano has been an overall car like it.
Like seat to more than the zero gravity.
"Interior design for storage usage is a zero! Design the vehicle with the thought in mind that just possibly a female might happen to buy the car and would enjoy having luxury and convenience, outside of radio and music."
The style and look of the vehicle and the fast take-off.
Nothing
Leather seats
"I also own a 2011 Murano, which I have been reasonably satisfied with. It has also had some quality issues. Consumer Reports does not give Nissan high quality ratings. The vehicles have been purchased primarily because my wife likes your styling. This recent ABS recall does not speak well of your commitment to quality. Other items already mentioned indicate that you have ongoing quality concerns."
My wife likes the styling.
"Nothing necessarily.  I absolutely love it except for the fact that, if I had it to do over again, I would have bought the SL rather than the SV.  After only 5,000 miles, I can see that having blind spot monitoring would be beneficial to me.  It's difficult to know that I'm changing lanes safely as I cannot see traffic well when turning my head to check.  Less of a blind spot (in future models) and better hands free audio sound would be great."
"The smooth ride, gas mileage, quality, dependability, body-style (except for the blind spot).  Too numerous to list.  Love it."
I hate the transmission. They replaced the panel with scratches. My interior looks like it has discolored spots all the time. The plastic is so cheap everything scratches it.
Heated seats remote start and awd
Nothing.  Love it!
Exterior look
Apple carplay / Android auto System
The exterior look and leather seats
"Fix the wind noise. The dealership said they drove two other models just like it and they all sounded the same. If that is true we will never own a Nissan again, and my Wife already wants to take a huge loss and get rid of this one. Our mistake was in not driving the car above 35mph in the test drive. We didn't realize we would have to."
The exterior appearance
None that I can think of
The looks
the style and ride and roominess
"Cruise control, graphics on dashboard, camera, wheels , seats ,mpg, exterior design, interior finishes, auto back seat controls"
I love my new vehicle
The cool and warm seats
More storage space in the back would be good.
Outside noise is the only disappointment.  It seems less quiet than my former Murano (2012)
"sharp lines, comfort interior"
I feel the moonroof should not be as noisy. It has annoyed me from day one. I thought it could be fixed or I would not have gotten one with it in it.
Look & nice ride.
Driver's and Front passenger seats still outdated. Not powe driven
Aerodynamic design.
"Offer massaging seats, and a more variable lumbar support on both front seats. Also a larger, wider, more forward sunroof, giving a convertible feel."
Comfort and ride quality.
Styling
I love my Murano. Of course everyone wants better gas mileage. Overall it is an awesome car!
The ride!
It's brand new.  Never drove a new vehicle before
"I like how it suits my family of four for our travel needs. So far, it runs very smooth and provides the features that I like."
Driver seat could be wider for larger drivers.  More variety of interior color choices.  Better gas mileage.
The ease of getting in and out of it.  The safety features.
"Quality of the Interior seems to have been overlooked.  The Dash Mounting was loose and very annoying and it was especially annoying when the Service Department said to me twice that they had fixed it when they had not.  It took the 3rd visit for them to actually look and find the issue.    The Bluetooth Connectivity Issue needs to be addressed and fixed.  I have researched this online and found that many people have issues with this and the Service Departments seem to think their is nothing they can do, so Nissan or whomever is the Manufacturer of the System should correct this issue.  My Ford SYNC System was so much easier to use, especially when calling someone and I never had the intermittent connection issues.  The Tires are really just the ""Somewhat Cheap Option"" that was put on the Car.  I paid for the Platinum Version  and was hoping for top of the line all the way around and the tires definitely fell short.  I hate to try to bother the dealership to dig through and take the time to actually find some GOOD Tires."
"I really liked the Exterior Looks of the Murano.  The Interior looks are exceptional too. My wife just bought a 2016 Maxima Platinum and I was hoping to get the SUV/Crossover Version.  It is somewhat like the Maxima, but falls short in a few places."
Better fuel efficiency.
Overall appearance and quality.
"Better quality control of paint, it is below industry standard for this quality of vehicle"
"Styling, technology, engine"
"Having a larger towing capacity would be nice; however, I understand that increasing the towing capacity may sacrifice other great features of this car, such as its ride quality.  Standard proximity sensors on the front and rear would be nice.  The cameras are great but I personally prefer to look out the windows and have audible ques to help me park my car."
"We love our new Murano, it is a great car that provides a comfortable and quite ride with a smooth powerful V6 engine that still returns good gas mileage.  The seats are the most comfortable automobile seats I have sat in.  The interior design is very inviting and impressive with high quality materials."
"Nothing! This is my 3rd murano, and I could'nt be happier with them all."
Style
quieter interior
very good running engine so far!!
I do not like the way the wood grained interior shows up as a reflection in the outside mirrors.
Comfortable seats and quiet ride.
Turning radius I have had a harder time adjusting to getting used to the other. Ew cars that I've had
Cabin roominess and luxurious feeling
Glove compartment too big.    Lose items in it.   Would have preferred more spaces and far smaller in size.   Same thing for the arm rest storage.
"Comfort,  quiet,  navigation technology, automatic hatch"
The quality and attractiveness
would like heated steering wheel like my previous Altima
"Handling of vehicle, sit higher than sedan"
More Tech in the S Model...
Everything...especially the style and the Nissan Brand.
wanted 60 mpg! lol
everthing
"The color, it's a 6 cylinder, feel solid, love how it handles."
Zero gravity chairs
"Prior car was a Cadillac DTS so was a pretty quiet ride, this car has more wind noise. In tech area I wondered if the car can be started or unlocked/locked with a smart phone app. I also have my phone, an apple 6, connected with Bluetooth but can't get texting to work."
Overall I'm very satisfied with my vehicle.
Have better QA on factory line paint department.
"Sharp looking, nice ride in seats. Amount of room for 4 people."
"Looks,ride"
Just one design quality that might be adjusted is the bottom of the front doors seem to collect mud and don't wash off in the car washes. Angle of the door closing under the car seems to cause mud to smear on pant clothing upon getting out of the vehicle.
"Convenience of operation, comfortable ride, quality of instrumentation and clarity of operation. Great response to all demands."
move the 12vlt outlet and make it hot even with the key off
ride
Better fuel economy
The look and feel
Appearance
I wished the seats would lift you up more higher so you can see on top of the car when you turning so you can have better view and i wished the steering wheel will adjust up higher as well but in all I LOVE MY NISSAN!
It's Brand  New and i don't have to worry about about going far and being stranded. I can get to point A and B with no worries!
I have been buying from Anderson for over 25 years...great people...and great service mangeer....bill...
I has all the bells and whistles that I could ever hope to have
I am hoping software updates are available to fix my connection issues and issues with the radio.  I just did not have time to wait at the shop while they fixed the molding piece on the bottom of the center counsel.  It would be great if you pushed updated for software out to owners rather than us having to go out to the shop.
"Interior styling and ""cool"" options.  I have always preferred the Key FOB system of Nissan and the exterior styling usually stays fresh with their vehicles. Love the cashmere interior."
I really love this car Did have some issues with Nissan connect until about three weeks ago and they finally I think have it at least working somewhat. I had to be on the phone with the Nissan connect people for almost 2 1/2 hours but I think it is acceptable. Won't know until we take a trip and really used it as far as Google or TripIt visor. Wish Pandora was available but maybe someday
"My favorite feature at this point it's probably the keyless entry, being able to answer the phone through the car, and the overall appearance of the car. It's a real beauty!"
The roominess and 4 wheel drive
"Latest technology such as forward emergency braking, blind spot warning."
Style
Nothing
The room inside and the look
Comfort and quiet
This audio system should have a sub woofer. The lift gate should fit so that the seams are even when it shuts.  And the silver accent piece should not have a gap when the front doors are closed.
I like the bold styling of the exterior.  I like the interior space to include the back end for storage.  I like the V-6 engine.  And the safety features; especially the camera.
"continue to give the best options on all cars at low costs; ie mapquest, heated seats, automatic rear opening hatch etc"
comfortable and good gas mileage
Nothing
handling is a little slow with the steering and needs a little more power and wish it got better gas mileage but I only have 750miles on the vehicle.Also the 1st week of having the new vehicle there was a safety recall on brake actuator made me think dealer new that but did not tell me.
comfortable seats and I like the style of the vehicle and good view out the front wind shield.
"If it was quieter to drive on the highway, I would be 100% happy with this vehicle."
Attractiveness
Very satisfied
Everything
Figure out a way to keep black interior from showing so many marks!!!
Interior is nicer and rides much smoother than my last Murano.
"I love my Murano!......I had one from 2009-2015, then bought an Acura MDX.  I couldn't wait to trade in my Acura and get another Murano!!!  The Acura flooded in the recent Louisiana Flood, so when the insurance totaled my car, we went straight to PriceLeBlanc Nissan to get another Murano."
"Attractiveness, Comfort, driving comfort, dependability,"
not have made a switch that was unknown to myself at the time.
Nothing I know of except have a school to learn all the features.
The backup and all around view cameras.
The tank size is smaller than my previous Altima despite getting understandably worse gas mileage. I have to fill up twice as often now not to have anxiety over my gas level. The tank should have been larger not smaller.
I love the styling and comfort. I love the features that I have in the Platinum trim such as cooled seats. I like the sound system and connectivity though the phone is sometimes so sensitive that it blares the person you are talking to.
Passenger seat is uncomfortable. Noise coming from luggage racks. More storage room. Easier instructions for using the technology.
Gas mileage is OK and the ease of getting in and out.
Everything...
The side storage compartments in the door aren't big enough to hold much. An umbrella barely fits. I used to store m iPad in the door when traveling and it won'5 fit in my Murano??
The comfort of the seats and the gas mileage!
None
"Design, color, interior."
Correct paint issues
Interior
"I don't know, gas mileage was expected to be better than I am getting otherwise the car is affine piece of work."
appearance
"Ease of exiting the vehicle, I have knee issues. :)"
I wish the gas tank was a bit larger. Even though it is fuel efficient I am still having to get gas too much cause the tank is small....also the placement of the latch for the gas tank is hard to see when getting gas at night and the lever is hard to differentiate from the hood lever.
I like the entertainment system in the vehicle
Excellent vehicle and have enjoyed it everyday. Could be better if the wind noise would be improved
Styling and comfort
"Heavy ride, feels smooth and safe."
Price
Everything is great
"I like the most is the shape,"
I am concerned about the electronic issues With the Bluetooth The blind spot And The remote start. Taking it in or called because I am not sure if The issue needs to be happening at the time. If there is any information On these issues it would be appreciated
How it looks and the room
It's big in front and shorter in rear on exterior. Make more balance. A place to put woman's purse.
Heated steering wheel. Safety features
"Comfort, power, and technology"
It is quiet and rides very smooth. Plenty of power to pass when needed.
Nothing - car is perfect
"Interior comfort, safety and ease of use."
My prior Nissan had more perks.
Drives nice
an extra gallon of gas would improve the range just enough to eliminate an extra stop on trips west from Colorado
"knowing that while enjoying the vehicle now, it will continue to perform for over 200,000 miles.  We have a 2005 Murano with 225,000 miles and it is going strong.  We now have 4 Murano, a Rogue, and Nissan small pickup"
Better cleanliness at delivery and customer service at the dealership.
Body style
"We really are quite happy with our 3rd Murano.  We have been very spoiled by them.  There are improvements from the previous two, but a couple of things that were better before.  (The headrest situation for one.)  I need to spend a couple of hours with the salesman to learn all the ins & outs of how to use the electronics."
The seats ARE very comfortable - when I get to sit in the passenger seat.) .  The improved gas mileage is great.  My husband likes the styling.  (It takes me a while to get used to changes.)  The convenience of the navigation system - where gas stations / Costco / Burger King etc are is very convenient.  The navigation system is updated -  The 2013 (updated from the one that came with the 2010) navigation system couldn't find Port Hueneme (in California)  this one can!
charging adapters need to be hot at all times.  Frustrating my phone cannot charge while it is turned off.  I travel frequently with kids and they like to watch movies in the car.  The cannot do this now due to me not wanting to leave the car running.  My 2013 Traverse allowed for charging while the vehicle was off.
"transmission, comfort"
The only thing is I had the Platinum Murano before and had the remote for opening the rear gate which is good for us older people and thought they came on all Murano's so forgot to ask salesman and he didn't mention it so got everything I wanted on Murano and love it but sure do miss the remote rear gate.
The ride the beauty and the overall performance.  I had my previous Murano 7 1/2 years.
I don't really like anything about this car.
I wish when you buy the car.. someone from the dealearship would set up an hour with an expert on a day other than the delivery day.. to go over all the controls  and show you how to manage them. It should be after at least a week so you have had some time to familiarize yourself with the car.
"It handles smoothly and looks great. It has a lot of safety features, which is a comfort. Overall I like Nissan vehicles."
Some of the first safety features such as inability to open the doors until car is turned off or inability to operate controls during reverse should be able to be turned off
Comfortable ride
Just the wind noise. All else is fine.
Practicality.
When I recieved the vehicle beside the wind noise problem that has been repaired the vehicle also had a recall for the antilock brake actuator.  It took two trys to get a moon roof that was not warped and over a month to get the part to fix the brake thus I had to be without my car for 14 days awaiting repairs.  To the credit of the dealer they did furnish a loaner car free during the wait.
The appearance and comfort of the vehicle
"its new, good looking and roomy"
Fix nissan connect and improve mileage.
Looks and comfort. Amazing controls.
"My sales experience was very poor and left a bad taste in my mouth.  It was the worst I have ever experienced in terms of being manipulative and insulting.  I like the car, however, and I hope the ABS fix can be accomplished quickly."
"The ride, the music system, the seats, the hybrid engine, the roominess."
Get a better more knowledgeable management team at the dealership.
It is just COOL to look at.  It was for my wife and she loves it.  She has a Murano the first year they came out and loved it but now loves her new one even more.  In 24 months we will be get me the Altima (my last care in life).  We trust the Nissan product.  We just don't like the way the transaction was done.  Wil the finance guy was good to work with and so was our rookie salesman (he really tried to meet our needs).  The GM and the SM were week at best.
"lane departure feature. better gas mileage. the sticker is not very accurate, but anything was better than my Chev Tahoe. auto braking feature like on other models."
comfort and smooth ride. the seats are outstanding on a long drive. that is the main reason for the purchase and gas mileage.
Fix my issues so I don't have to drive in a noisy car. Also I forgot to mention the Bluetooth connectivity is sporadic and when talking sometimes the volume does not act correctly.
"The look,"
It's comfort and security features.
"The items to which should be improved includes:  Fit and Finish ( Alignments of doors, hatch, hood)  Better fitment of weather seals around doors and windows.  improve peppiness in driving dynamics ( My 2016 pathfinder is more peppy than my 2016 murano, bought on the same day)    I love the car, however, I am very concerned about the rumors of transmission issues. I will give Nissan a try, it proves reliable I will continue to buy Nissan, If not I will have to change Makes. Both our cars have about 3,800 Miles as of 11/25/2016."
"I love the way it looks, how comfortable the seats are. I absolutely love how the rear seats slide fore and aft. really enjoy the electronics package. The only thing missing is lane departure avoidance system."
MORE KNEE ROOM. THE CENTER CONSOLE IS A LITTLE BIG FOR ME
STYLE. SOUND SYSTEM.
"Of course id love more gas milage.  I love this car! My last car was a 2014 honda civic which seemed to have more gadgets than what the nissan has. However i sat in the nissan and had to have it.  The most comfortable ride ive ever sat in.  I've bought at least 5 hondas, love them and after simply sitting in this car, i switched!"
The seats and the rear lights look sporty. Very roomy inside
"Had 2011 exact same model vehicle.  It was better quality (heated steering wheel, no plastic on steering wheel, seat a little more comfortable) than the 2016.  Would have upgraded had I known this had not the same features."
"Safety features, warning lights & beeps to assist in driving more safely.  Love the new body style."
Look and feel
"Someone  that knows about the remote and heater the way they work together.  When I was buying the car they tell you the remote works 10mins , has a memory,  from the previous  setting. But to actually  use it , they have no idea."
"The interior,  its  beautiful,  and sleek styling."
Better fuel economy
Exterior styling and handeling
The sound insinde new muda o is always like have wind touch the car
Interior car is amazing
Very quiet
I think the vehicle is great just the way it is
Please move the USB port or put a Nitch in the door so it can close around wire. I find it annoying the door has to stay open.
Nice pickup. Classy. Upgrade from my rav 4
"I like the seats the most, very confortable."
"1) The Heated Steering Wheel should be part of the Heated Seats package.  2) The heating/cooling fan should be a dial, not a shallow push space.  3) The rear (center) seats should have easier accessible seat belt latches when using a child seat."
"1)  The safety features: 360 camera; lane assist warning;  front braking assist; warning of keys left in car; warning of lights left on, etc.  2) The comfort of the power front driver seat, with all of the adjustments.  It offers a much better comfort for me than any other vehicle I test drove !  3) It looks sharp !"
Brighter headlamps.
It looks like a Q-30
Nothing
Ebrithen
"There are more significant blind spot issues with this version than the previous Murano, particularly the ""A"" pillar."
"Excellent driving feel, better than previous version."
comfort of ride
"Driver side-there is a hard piece of plastic that sticks out at seat bottom, scrape leg on in summer. A little sluggish when pulling onto roadway"
"The style inside and out is great. The features, technology, safety."
I would like to have more storage areas within the drivers reach. Little cubby holes in the dash. The glass holder is too close to the rearview mirror.
I love the exterior look. I haven't driven it on slick roads yet but I hear Murano's handle well.
"I really like my murano, but I should of bought the rogue, I had a rogue prior to buying this murano. The murano is bigger than I thought it was. with the 20' wheels it makes it hard for me to get in with a bad hip."
It is a good looking car.
"Fix my Bluetooth! I bought your compatible phone, and it still has the same problem."
"Appearance, drive, stereo and comfort."
"Love my Murano. Handles like a dream, absolute luxury, safety features are fabulous.  Just an overall exceptional vehicle. Didn't want to give all 10's on the previous page so you wouldn't stop designing such great autos!"
Safety.  I drive a lot of highways and the features offer additional security. Followed by luxury. It's a beautiful automobile and love the automatic lift gate!
I think more room for the compartments that are provided.  I find they are shallow and most stuff does not fit in them.
"all the features.  I never had heated seats, nav system"
"I could have gotten a better price on the 2016 and think I am paying too much. I was told the 2017 would not be out until Spring and it came out soon afterwards. Since I am leasing, it is less of an issue but I am seeing a lot of high end leases out now for less than $429 I am paying with less down. THE WORST IS calling billing or customer service. I have waited over 10 minutes more than once. INEXCUSABLE!"
"The shape and look of the interior and exterior are what made me choose it. Although I still feel it is too big and the look out the front is very WIDE while driving, It is a good looking car."
nothing!
the color and comfortable level while sitting inside.
Inside heater faster warm up and more output. CD that holds more than 1 disk considering the cost.
"Type of vehicle, comfort, drivability,"
"I have only owned the vehicle for about 3 months and driven less than 2,000 miles so I do not feel I have enough drive time to respond"
I like everything about it as of now
I would like my front driver's side door fixed so that it doesn't sound as if my window is always cracked open. This could hopefully fix the stereo sound issue as well.
I like the way it looks and how comfortable it is to drive and sit in.
Fix the audio interface issues and the Nissan Connect interface
Almost everything.
It's really smart
none
The exterior appearance and the color.
You can't change the gas mileage because it was highly misrepresented. Not sure you can do anything about the appearance of scuffs and smears and handprints. Unless it could be treated with something better than our armor all. I guess you could provide me with the trunk cover (which I thought was supposed to come with the car but apparently did not even though all the cars except mine had one in it.)  Then I wouldn't see the carpet scuffs. If the steering wheel could be loosened that would make it more comfortable to drive.
I love the safety features. The blind spot alert and back up camera are wonderful. The stereo is great.
I love it. Beautiful.
Looks
I feel the seat belts are a little difficult to find & fasten
I love everything!  So comfortable & convenient!
Nothing I like my car I just want to get the noise fix it go for service on Friday 11/25
"It drives well. I like all the computer enhanced features, mpg, gps, and rear video camera"
"Improve the easy of use of navigation and radio.  Use words, not icons!  These are very important features for a vehicle, as they are safety and enjoyment related."
"The wonderful seats and comfort, the engine pep, gas mileage for this size of a car, interior space, exterior design, interior layout, great ride, interior features, fog lights, good lights on bright setting (regular lights are a little dim), the overall elegance and comfort."
Appearance
Be able to upgrade to latest technology of similar model.  We have a 2016 that is not able to get certain things similar to a 2017.
Appearance and technology features
The way the hood is bent on the edge by the wipers reflects sunlight to frequently.
Reliability
Look and feel
I wish that the back up camera had a feature that would beep when you get too close to something.
The comfort and ride and the look.
If I had not like the vehicle I would not have bought it.  I have no suggestion others than the noise which I will address with the service department.
Like several things and hard to narrow down
"As with my earlier 2008 Maxima, the Murano has driver 'blind spots' that are a nuisance and dangerous, as the driver really needs to be conscious of them.  Also, the seat belt location is difficult to reach."
The exterior design and cargo capability.
engine power comfort
Figure out why the new OVT transmissions have a flaw
The look and pickup
The air conditioner makes too much noise while the vehicle is in idle. Better gas mileage on the vehicle.
"the shape of the vehicle, the electronics, and the roominess of the vehicle. I also like the body type."
Outstanding Service !!!
It handles extremely well and is very high efficient.
Better shock absorbents and roomier driver section.
Exterior look.
The gas milage could be better.
Great car! No Improvement needed!
The smoothness on the road
I would like it if all of the doors unlocked as soon as the vehicle is put in park.
"stylish looks, great ride, comfy and roomy.  It is my 3rd Murano, so I guess I like them!  I get many compliments and questions in parking lots/gas stations, etc."
Love everything except the dim light setting is not good at all.
Alert passenger when seat belt not engaged.
"Basically,  I love everything about my suv.."
Fix the issues I am having.
Driving and looks
the drive
Very nice vehicle to drive and very comfortable.
I love the look and drive. It feels like a more expensive vehicle and rides smoothly.
"manuel control of heating,back seat belys difficult to use"
"ride,comfort of seats, quiet interior,  fuel economy, egine power and seamles shifting of transmission"
Offer the garage opener as a standard feature. It is bothersome to not have one built in now and that was one of the main feature I wanted when purchasing a vehicle. I almost did not get this one because of it.
I LOVE the color and design!!!!
An excellent vehicle.
The right and left side mirrors show a reflection of the brushed silver around the two air vents inside the vehicle.  It is a distraction when using the side mirrors while driving.  Perhaps a darker color on the vents would solve the issue.
The ride is solid.
Less cheap materials on the interior. Particularly plastic knobs and buttons.
It is comfortable and fun to drive.
better fuel efficiency
size
Reliability
"Just get to the bottom of the vibration or harmonic coming from the engine or trans. I don't know which, between 35 and 45 MPH.  Other than that I have no problems at all with the Murano I enjoy it very much except for this aggravating vibration at 35 to 45 MPH"
"I like it all, the Murano is very well put together and very nice interior and paint on the outside.  I have not complaints about the car overall.  I'm hesitant to take it in for the vibration/harmonic as they will think I'm imagining it.  I will mention it at service time."
"Gloss black interior material brings on a sentiment of cheesy cheap. Move to a charcoal or matte texture. Not a fan of chrome exterior bits and could be done better in a satin metallic - more like older Nissans. The interior smell lingered too long, like it was sprayed to smell so - we had to drive with the windows open when possible to not feel the smell too overwhelming."
A lot. The features at the price we purchased tops the list - in comparison with vehicles that are a class down and more expensive.
Space for cell in front and room for cds  lighted cup holders   changeable dash lights different colors
Love driving it. Handling is super. The car hugs the road. The seats hug me. There are things I am disappointed with   1.  The plastic base of the seat rubs my leg if I am not careful. I am short and travel long hours in the car. This when it bothers me  2.  I have an iPhone 6. And texting is not available. Disappointed   3.  The design of the hood closest to the front window reflects sunlight directly into my eyes when heading into the sun.
The ride  The comfort  The confidence of handling in bad weather   The seats  Fun to drive
Place  event for heat to come out near the floor as you've indicated on the panel selection. And large the small compartment behind the gearshift so that one can get to the auxiliary connection it's too small.  Be aware of silver on the dash reflecting in the rearview mirror while driving. Change the design of the overhang of the roof onto the back window to allow a squeegee to be used to clean the glass.
"all in all, very nice vehicle/"
smooth ride
Could not find tilt for steering wheel.
It's appearance
"Everything! Safety features, comfort, look and Hugo Duran!"
Looks price
There are many blinds spots on this vehicle. The camera helps but if it raining the camera is of no help.
Very comfortable to drive.  Adaptive cruise control is awesome.
I am extremely pleased with my new Nissan Murano.  I have never owned an SUV before.  My reason for purchasing it was because of being easy to get in and out of. I have Parkinson's and this is so much easier to get my walker out of the back area. I absolutely love my Murano!  I am widowed and this is the first time in 60 years I have ever selected a car on my own.  Thank you!  Jean Warburton
Everything
"The comfort the seats are so comfortable my wife has had back surgery and the seats are so comfortable on her back.   I like the instrument panel easy to read and everything is with in easy reach.  The ride is so comfortable, you do not hear any road noise.  Very happy with the Nissan"
have not had it long enough
looks and over all performance---sofar---new vehicle
I need a little more help on some of the features.  The fact I don't have the help is all my fault.  I will ask a few more questions when I go in for an oil change.  I do better when I am shown something a couple times.  It was hard giving up my car of 17 yrs.  It truly was a winner.  This one has proved to be a winner too.  I get comments it is a beautiful car.
The look of the car.  The pick up is nice.  The braking is very similar to my last car.
"So far, so good.  Love to drive the vehicle, and love the looks of it.  I have noticed one time what looked like condensation on the inside of one rear tail light, and will keep an eye out on that.  It also seems to rev up really high upon starting, but the dealer said that is normal...just seems way too much to me though.  Otherwise, very happy with the vehicle."
The outside looks and color; the inside design; the moon roof...I just like it all!
Predictive driving and safety features
The only other complaint I have is dust collecting at back window   we live just one mile from hard surface road   The dust collect so bad due to back window design.  It is really bad on just one mile of gravel road
The seats.  And all safety features
appearance
"Not sure, unable to think of anything right now"
Horse power as well as all the bells and whistles
"Really wanted a merlot color.  I am very unhappy with the warranty.  This is, essentially, not a three year warranty.  Did. To find out about this until after the paperwork/purchase was done.  On the platinum level of vehicle... oil changes should be provided for at least 18 months at no charge"
"Safety features...side car warning, front braking warning, cross traffic.  Especially love the two screen backup camera and the ability to use the camera other than backing up, i.e. checking position of other cars when parking."
I am regretting the size of the vehicle and not having 3rd row seats. I think I may have been happier in a pathfinder.
"The cooled seats, the blindspot sensors."
Fix the hesitation when shifting to drive from reverse. I talked to another new Murano owner with the same year and model and he has the same problem.
Definitely the new  exterior Styling and a joy to drive
not a thing
the way it looks
nothing. My wife and i love it.
It makes my wife happy. And it looks good.
So far I haven't found anything that needs improved upon. Great car and easy to drive and use all  the goodies..
It rides like dream and is very quiet.  The dash easy to read and the Nav systems is great as well.
Look and handling
"seats take time to break in, but my feeling right now is they could be softer or in some way be more comfortable. It's not that bad but thats my biggest complaint but also I feel it could have stronger brakes, but I also have a 370 Z that may influence my feelings."
the intellegent system. At 65 we need all the help we can get and it's advantages.
"Even though it is an S model, should have had a platinum style wheel"
Pretty much everything
Please increase mileage eficiency.  Compare with the model 2008 this Murano still the same miles/gal.    Also add some space in the back seat for us to keep coffee cup or water bottle.
Price
"Appearance, safety features, roominess"
I plan on having everything checked on the 5000 mile service
The monitoring of tire pressure. My left rear tire always register as low tire.warning lights aways appear. Have carried it in to dealership once.light came back on the next time i drove car. Hadn't drive car for several days i would be more comfortabe driving vehicle if this problem was taken care of.payig to much money to have to look @a warning light each time i get in vechicle.
The comfortable ride.
I had many more technology features on the Hyundai Geneses I traded-in for the Murano.
Fuel economy.
"AC doesn""t cool  as good as other vehicles I have owned in Texas climate."
"Handling, braking and technology"
love it!Its perfect for me and my family
"We like it a lot, its confortable and economical."
It's look
fix the hands free text feature to reply to text. It's embarrassing to have a platinum mutant and I can't use the reply text feature.
Body style and smooth ride
Nothing  it's  fine
The  ride
I would have made more ground clearance under the Murano
Comfortable seating
nothing-love the car
the ride
Nothing! This Vehicle Is Great!
"Comfortness, quietness, spaciousness"
Nothing at the present time. It just will take awhile to use the heating controls to  get the desired affect.
"The looks and the style. Paint job.  I would have like to see the top luggage rails match the color of the car. We  wanted the red or black vehicle, but purchased the silver one because at least they matched."
Nothing is wrong with my vehicle so far. I have only had it not quite 3 months. Haven't even had a chance to drive in snow.
I love the way it drives.
NOTHING! I love the car! :-)
The interior and panoramic sunroof
I was very frustrated with my initial experience.  1) Broken compartment lid when we bought the vehicle.  2) Low tire my very first evening. 3) recall the next day which the dealer I purchased from refused to address.
the comfort is great.  and the roominess
"I am happy with the car so far though concerned with the amount of technology deployed there will be some service bills to repair things ahead.    You can also design the car to make it easier to put on the cross rails.  Many people will want these as skiers, bikers, etc buy SUV's.  The dealer told me these are labor intensive to install the crossrails."
"Quiet on the highway, handles well, good sound system, 4 wheel drive."
Make the head roof a little more higher
"Style, looks, fuel is really great"
Its roominess and its power
Fix the problems with the Bluetooth
reliability
"The original Murano 2003, was very different from most SUVs in body design.  Now it looks like EVERY SUV on the street.  Please make it unique again.  Similar to the Juke body design.  Shake it up.  You did when you first designed Muranos.  Also improving the sound system (other than Bose).  It's not as good as it should be for this car.  Also, the gas tank should be bigger."
"I love the pacific sunset color!  The interior is beautiful and the interior design is too.  Easy to handle.  The seats are perfect for someone with back problems!  I can now use regular gas, the engine is still very peppy and great gas mileage.  It is definitely  improved from the 2003 first models!"
Towing ability and more ground clearance
Car drives well.  Good in town and on open road
Fuel economy is not what I expected
Overall outside look
"Make sure no one has to go through this hassel, if the problem cannot be fixed, give a new vehicle to the customer instead of more headaches of having to drive a rental then their own car. Dont fix whats not broken."
It drives well and has a comfortable rider
"With the exception of the previous mentioned items, I think the Murano is a great vehicle. It rides and drives exceptionally well, the fuel economy is good for a vehicle of its size, the seats are amazingly comfortable, and the exterior design is very attractive."
See previous comments
Color
"Quiet comfortable , nice handling"
Better fit of exterior panels. Reduced wind noise. Easier access to seat belts. Better road feel in steering
"Handling good, stylish.roomy, great interior."
When I picked up the vehicle the tires were not balanced and I thought that the vibration problem was coming from that.  after that was resolved I still had a vibration problem that was more noticeable when the car was at 40mph.  The dealer suggested that it was me and not the car and generally treated me like an idiot.  I won't be back there again.  Got the same treatment from Customer relations
When driving in the rain through water impact is pretty loud in the vehicle.  Also only had the car a month and the drivers seat looks like it might eventually come apart at the seam.
"Very smooth ride, great gas mileage and very nice looking design."
work on the pairing of blue tooth and heating system
I still love it
LOOKS AND PERFORMANCE
New.  Ease of handling.  Safety features -rear view camera.  Side cameras.  Keyless start and entry.
None at this time
"Style, safety features, and comfort"
Too much wind noise on the freeway car should be quieter
Exterior look.. like that has a lot of room.. transmission is great
Everything ok
It is very comfortable and it drives well. I love the back up camera and the Bluetooth feature
"a few free car washes, a few free oil changes,  Lower monthly payments"
i like how your pair your phone with your vehicle & if you get a text message it just vibrates & doesn't ring
"The clicking was fixed, something with the sound system. The Murano is the best car we have ever owned or ridden in."
"Everything, the quiet ride is the greatest because my husband has a hearing problem and he can actually hear me."
"Not much; excellent vehicle.  Only issue I have, compared to the past Nissan products I have owned, is the transmission makes a ""whirling"" or humming sound in gear as I back up and slow down to stop..... Dealer inspected and said it was normal with newer upgraded CVT.  Not a big problem with me...just love this car."
"The new styling of the Murano is fantastic. Interestingly, my most favorite thing is the Mocha (dark brown) interior....very rich looking and feeling.  Have to add...the ride quality on a trip is fantastic..."
Nothing...I love it!  I have never been this excited about a new vehicle.
The new style compared to my last Murano
Liked the rear storage space on the 2015 Rogue with the adjustable shelf
Just about everything Third Murano that I owned and like this one the best
The engine noise is so loud that it sounds like a small 4 cylinder engine.  I can't have conversation while driving on a highway because of the noise.  Totally disappointed.
Comfortable seating.
Improvement in the brightness of the back up lights would be excellent.
The safety qualities
I think the leather seats should have been treated to prevent the seats from getting dirty so easily.
I am satisfied with my vehicle.
I went from a car to an SUV. I like the size.
Hatch release inside of vehicle. Only way to open hatch is from outside. I know it does not open using key (I don't have that up grade)but you should have a manual release from the inside.
Love the color. I can find it in a parking lot. Like the body style. Sharp looking.
I thought the back up camera beeps when you get too close like my old pathfinder that was a  disappointment that the Murano doesn't have that feature.
"nothing, I love it all"

At this time I don't have any comments.

design it to be a easier to see out the back windows
"sporty, rides good"
interior look and feel
Drop the CVT
More and better designed cup holders.  Particularly the back seat panels.   Rear passenger control of AC/heater controls.       Forgot to mention Nissan Connect is a complete joke.  App said Pandora and iHeart radio was available thru Connect but that is not true with the Murano.  Who cares about Facebook and Twitter. All Platmium models should provide the best Nissan has to offer.  No just certain models.
Interior style.  Instrumentation. Exterior design.  Ride. Quiet.  Comfort.
More features if possible
Everything
"I shall be taking my car in to hopefully address the concerns I've raised.  The shoddy workmanship on the carpet and center console are a concern and disappointing; however, the safety issue related the airbag is a serious matter.    Lastly, I've asked my dealership to repeatedly provide a copy of the Monroney sticker (required by law) and I've yet to receive it after now owning the car for nearly 3 months."
"Drives nicely, rides smoothly, good acceleration, comfortable cabin, looks good"
I wish the home link buttons for the garage lit up at night. It is very difficult to see the buttons at night.
The exterior look.
Room and space to carry things
"Even on the basic model,  the driver seat adjustment should be electronic. A lot of other cars included that. I liked the mirando so much I settled for it, but manual driver seat adjustment?  Very year 2000"
Smooth drive and interior comfort!
the ride
"Rear- Lift gate difficult to open. There is no way to open from inside vehicle.( mine is the RV model). I'm an 80 year old male, what does a little old lady do?"
"Roominess, uses regular gas, back up camera, comfort, good looks."
"I'll take the vehicle in and get the flap on the underside repaired when I have my first service, and I'll ask about the air conditioning and the bluetooth connectivity then.  Until then, I'm content with my car."
The performance of the engine and comfort of the seats.
"Better sound system,  speakers specifically"
How smoothly it drives and feels while driving.
Im totally disappointed
The leather seats
Nothing
Ride and look nice
"A/C seats.  Smoother edges inside the steering wheel, in order to turn the vehicle with one finger.  Center console that opens left and right not up.   Hologram speed display on drivers windshield."
"It looks great inside and out.  Nissan reliability, my third Nissan.  Reasonable price for the kind of vehicle."
"Reliable, strong, design, roominess,"
"Within 2 months, the heated steering wheel did not work an entire new steering wheel was ordered and will be installed next week at that tie, the vibration issue will be addressed. I am new to the Nissan brand and am somewhat concerned about 2 issues so soon."
Interior appearance  Very comfortable seating
Fix the noise when the seat adjusts. Make the steering wheel material flush with no hard edges exposed.
The dependability and the amount of space inside.
Interior quietness is good but not excellent  Feel the need to speak loudly if using blue tooth for phone calls    Uneven pavements result in some steering wheel vibrations
Roominess and comfort of interior along with with smooth ride and functionality
Would prefer the middle seatbelt not be on the ceiling but on the seat.  Its very uncomfortable.
Have a place to discuss the dealer Bought car late on a Sunday rushed to get it done they are 145 miles away and I have unresolved issues...
It does ride like a dream...  Quite good power.
Improve gas mileage
"fun to drive, safe reliable"
"Bluetooth user operation was more convient in my 2009 than what I'm experiencing in my 2016 model. Only five quickdials available, really! Using controls on steering wheel are not user friendly."
Very comfortable ride.
"Vehicle instrument panel and radio controls i find to be  too busy, difficult, and dangerously distractive while driving. solution : make the controls less busy and reposition closer towards driver: make it easier to program favorite stations, need separate button for instant traffic and weather update, sound system needs better low to mid range amplification boost, & city gas mileage needs improvement, and oil dipstick is needs to be easier to locate(shouldn't be like its apart of the engine block)."
I love the look for a suv i find it to be aerodynamically attractive and classy. Interior  is very comfortable and sound.  Vehicle performance on the HWY is great has the power when you need it to accelerate out of and around dangerous situations as well as great braking when needed. Reliability is excellent so far.
I would like it to be a little quieter in the interior.
It's fun to drive.
"I wish my Murano had more get up and go. Small SUV's seem to be a bit of a gas hog. Overall, the vehicle handles very nicely."
"I have the height of an SUV, but it's not to big."
Just like it
The seat color attacks a lot of dirt. The car looks dirty even when it is clean.
I love the vehicle! The look is what I like the most.
"Am not happy with rear visibility. However, the camera helps. Very pleased overall."
"Being accustomed to an Xterra, I am really enjoying the comfortable ride."
I am elated with the vehicle I don't really know how the expectations could be raised. It's all good.
Add storage net in back so items do not shift.
Drives like a dream
Love the way it looks inside and out.  Drives and handles great.  I love the smart cruise control.
"Nothing, I really really enjoy my Murano"
The advanced body styling and the very luxurious interior
Quieter exhaust sounds in the cabin on light acceleration and quieter road noise. I have owned Lexus in the past and I feel they are much quieter in the cabin.
Body style.
Display screen must be more responsive and reliable for the navigation system and radio.
The interior space is awesome.  I love the seats.  They are very comfortable.
"The body style caught my eye at first,"
"When I turn on my heat, after letting car warm up for circa 3-4 minutes, I got what smelled like exhaust fumes in my interior. The first time that it happened, I ignored it then it happened again tonight, 12/8/16. The fumes were a bit over welming and excessive for a new car.  Is this normal?"
"Seats are different. I like them better than my 2011 Murano. I love the stering and handling.  I absolutely love the driver assist pkg. or whatever it is called.  As a senior driver, i can truly say this is probably my most likable feature."
Find a way to add some space underneath the seats
"The overall appearance, features and horsepower"
"Comfortable, solid feel, excellent tech features."
Seat belts are too far back and it is a bit of a reach.  There is a ding in the door jam that was there upon delivery. The carpet on the back seats are folded over the wrong way which is apperent when you fold down the back seats.
"Nice ride, good looking exterior, comfortable, lots of convenient features...."
"I have two row moonroof.    Moonroof cover is thin and inadequately blocks road noise, even when closed with the shade, especially noticeable on highway.   A padded shade would have been a better noise blocker."
Styling and luxury feel of interior.  Well done!
"My previous SL Nissan had a heated steering wheel. When I was shopping for my Murano, I asked about differences from my last vehicle to this one and most of it was the same. I was not aware that the heated steering wheel did not come on my Murano. Not a big deal but the only ""disappointment"" I have about my purchase as I really loved that feature previously with our winters."
The way it drives. It is a smooth ride and is very comfortable
Need rear sensors on all your vehicles.
Everything!
Nothing I can think of.
Exterior look
I love everything about my vehicle
I don't like that we cannot turn off the adaptive cruise control.  I had adaptive cruise on my Durango Citadel and I could use the cruise with or without adaptive.  Also not having a stereo system with integration to Android devices is frustrating and it was a question I didn't even think to ask thinking that it obviously would be compatible.
"The quality of the ride.  Very quiet cabin, extremely comfortable seats and the Bose system is top notch."
none
pretty much everything
The technology in the vehicle is amazing.
should come with a built in retractable cargo cover.  the accessory I purchased is OK but not superior.   I love my new Murano though so not much to recommend for improvements.
"Comfort of driver's seat,   handling on icy roads,  quick response of heater in cold weather and AC in hot weather  apprearance very cool for an SUV,  comfort for back seat passengers"
"The Nissan Connect is terrible.  I cannot connect my iPhone even with a USB cable.  Other than that, I really love the vehicle."
"Interior and exterior styling, Bluetooth connectivity for my phone."
"The weakest part of the vehicle's design is the lack of ""cubby"" spaces in and around the center console--I feel that area could be designed much better.  For example, I don't like how the USB port is buried INSIDE the console, and there is no cnvenient place to place my phone (the drink holder does not work well for this).  Another issue...and this is really minor, but....when you lock or unlock the vehicle via the key fob or exterior door handle button, like all other cars, it will ""beep"" once or twice. The question as a designer is should it beep twice when you lock it, or when you unlock it.  Unlike the Murano, it seems most other cars beep twice when you UNlock them . To me this makes more sense, because ""unlock"" or ""open"" have two syllables, while ""lock"" or ""close"" have one--this just makes more sense / is easier to remember (I told you it was minor!) .  I am surprised that the vehicle does not have speed-sensitive wipers (which pause at a stop).  Finally, I think the exterior design is exceptional, but the front grill, with the large Nissan logo looks as if it came off of a pickup truck.  I would try to refine that."
"#1--The exterior appearance.  #2--The interior design, with the exception of the center console.  #3--The vehicle size is just right...not too big / small."
The only thing is that the windshield washer signal pop up after putting in almost a gallon of windshield fluid about a week ago.
"It's comfortable. It drives nicely and I love it other than the one problem. I can use the phone. I love the map, but the navigation I haven't gotten use to."
everthing is ooutstanding
"the dependability, feel safe and able to manuever any terrain."
"Offer your NIssan Connect services on all models, including Murano!"
It is so attractive inside and out - a beautiful vehicle!
I would like to see it offered in a brighter blue color.
"I like the way it handles. I drove sports cars ( Camero's, Firebirds, Trans Am's ) most of the last 30 years.  This was the first SUV that handles the same way my sports car did.  And the look of the car is awesome, nice details and it rides really nice for an SUV."
"I am really enjoying my Murano,l have no complaints"
"The style,it look like a more expensive car,it has all the l luxury of a more expensive car."
Make an 8-position passenger seat adjustment and an A/C inverter standard

Dependable and romey.

Everything is good.
"I don't know if it's just my size and shape, or if this impacts others as well, but the driver seatbelt receptacle pokes into my hip and is quite painful.  It doesn't bother me as much if I don't use my seatbelt (which I know I shouldn't do), but I have to sometimes due to the discomfort of the situation."
"I love, love, love the design of the inside - the colors, the contours, the shapes, etc."
Just about everything
better sound throughout the entire car.
it is super.
everything.
"The new look, breaking safety system, rear and front cameras!"
"An option I have in another vehicle, at a lesser price point, is auto folding mirrors. I am a big fan of this feature and would like to see this in a top-level Murano's price point in the future. I am not a fan of the blind spot warning system in the Murano. The interior light on the door is good at night but not very much help in bright daylight scenarios."
"Very pleased with the overall quality and ride of the vehicle. Strong engine/transmission is a plus as well. Has the feel of a much more expensive luxury model, without the high sticker price."
styling and fuel economy
no problems at this time
all of it
I love my new suv.
"Looks good, drives good in rainy weather."
Make the road noise a little quieter.  Make the headrest adjustable to come forward.
The interior and exterior appearance.  Truly exceptional.
Keep your Nissan Connect current with Apple updates so I may enjoy all of the features that were promised when I bought it.  Someone should have told me about this issue.  I'm not the only iphone user that buys Muranos.
"I like the way it handles, gas mileage and the look of it."
I absolutely love my Murano. The trunk not closing and the air conditioner not always cooling properly would be my only complaints.
The gas mileage and overall look of the Murano.
I would make the gas tank a little larger so you  would not have to fill up as often.  I think it is an awesome car.  I traded in an Audi Q5 Hybrid and could not be more pleased with the car.  Love the brown color and the pearl interior.  Riders cannot believe how gorgeous it is!
The interior.  All of it.  Lights seats dash touch screen.
Fix navigation system to be more useable.
I like the styling.
Needs better gas mileage
Fun to drive
Do more real world quality control.  Make sure the plastic parts are snug and not hanging out
Looks and space
Honestly i love the Murano except for what I listed as issues. These are severe enough that I can not reccomend the car to coworkers. The Intermittent Bluetooth isn't that bad but the ratting at all speeds and road noise at highway speed are real negatives for my overall experience. I also have a Sentra and haven't had any of these noise issues with it.
The overall look of the interior and exterior

The vehicle is great. I just needed some one at the dealership to help with some of the controls & set my cell phones.
styling
Have the dealership deliver the title and other paperwork in a timely fashion.
Passenger seat should be able to be raised.  It should have the same options as the driver seat.  Turn signals could show in outside mirrors as it foes on many vehicles.
Style and comfort
The ride the interior and exterior
"I feel if its going to be a medium size SUV then it should look like that like the Exterra = the Exterra was the best SUV that Nissan has ever made and I wish you would bring it back if you had a new Exterra for 2016 I would have bought that instead of the Murano The Murano does not feel like a medium size SUV at all the Sun Visors are nice but on the upper left side of them the Sun always gets through, and when you go over bumps the wheels feel like the are going to come up through the car and the seats need to be able to come up at least another 1 inch higher for short people.  The Murano needs to have better fuel efficiency as well otherwise its an ok car.  Please make the Exterra again and I hope the Breaks are done better and that goes for the Murano as well the breaks scare me a lot especially when I m on the Freeway and have to stop suddenly the breaks really have a serious problem other wise when breaking normally they are ok.  I just feel that for a Medium size SUV it just does not seem like it is and feels too small."
I like the Radio screen and I like that its a new vehicle and I like the color Blue that I have
Vehicle is truly exceptional!   Only issue is a musty odor that originates from the air conditioner.
Exceptional maneuverability and absolutely beautiful!
Would have been nice to have the dual  DVD system  As an option as I had with my 2014  Platinum  Pathfinder
The exterior design
Idle speed needs adjusting; console compartment needs repair.  Concerned about the possibility of other problems manifesting when the car is brand new.  Entertainment/navigation software update would solve those issues.
"Looks, comfort, safety features, Bose audio system."

"It is very poor to not have footwell lights in the S and SV models, don't be so cheap, the car interior is very dark at night, I have ordered the footwell lights,  as an accessory, and am told to go on line for the instructions, but this accessory is not listed for instructions. more frustration. Put the lights on all models, very cheap for a $36K car cost,  to leave them out. where do I get instructions ???"
"size, power, good mpg for a V6, reputation for reliability, smooth."
Driver seat manual broke not even a week from adjusting up and down handle broke bad design over all everything. Excellent about the car except for the driver seat adjustment

"I spoke to Nissan North America parts (Lori) about the issues I was encountering.  The customer service responsiveness was aweful. Constant calls with no returned phone calls.  She still owes the general manager at my dealership a phone call regarding compensation and I haven't heard from him so I don't believe Lori got back to him yet either.  Again, aweful customer service when people can't respond timely.  I don't care how busy someone is.  At least get back to them and tell them you'll research and get back to them.  This has really made me concerned about owning a Nissan.  I had a Nissan previously without any issues.  I did not expect to buy a new vehicle and have issues."
Sharp and sleek looking and drives nice.
When you step on it from 0 to 65 it's boggs  out maybe because it's new
It's got power all wheel drive remind me of the Xterra but a lot bertter on gas mpg
It would be nice to have a quieter cabin and better gas mileage
"I just love the entire vehicle. Very luxurious feeling, comfortable, roomy, great features"
"I feel the front driver seat fabric will wear out quickly. Also, I think it should have come with power seats. Seats do not adjust enough compared to previous vehicles I have owned."
LOOKS! PERFORMANCE!
"The fuel economy is not even close to what was estimated. I am only getting about 18 miles per gallon during the ""break in"" period. Other than that, I am a satisfied customer except for the HUGE blind spot from the front door posts."

im so angry to buy this car
I'm really liking my car  maybe putting the button on the drivers side to change the radio station instead of the passenger side. Not a big deal love the car. l

"No Problems, it's great."
"Smooth Quiet Ride, it looks good and great on gas."

Room
No head room when getting in and out of the passenger side of car. Seat needs to be able to be lowered like the driver side
Good car just poor design for getting in and out
"nothing, maybe make  some safety related options standard."
"It's a beautiful, comfortable car and it is elegant and fun.  But, there are some quirks--I have to raise the seat up practically touching the steering wheel to see over the hood and not hit concrete islands on the sides or which are in front.  The seat belt cuts into my neck because there is not adjustment for a short person (5'1"").  And I have to scoot forward to put on the brake to then push the starter for the car, but when I do that the seat goes backward and takes my foot off the pedal.  That is most annoying.  Then I have to push it forward again (either manually or with the seat set device).  And I had to take off the head rests in the back seat so I could see (what little I could) out the back window.  Because, unless I have the car in reverse, I cannot see everything in the camera."
"The seat comfort and terrific ride, and the feel that it is a really safe car."
"I guess I'm still getting used to the CVT.  Sometimes, after backing out of my garage, when I put the car in Drive, it hesitates a few seconds before engaging.  Eliminate that and I'd be thrilled."
"Solid, sturdy with lots of power (except when it's shifting thru gears to reach driving speed)."
"style,performace,loaded with great features."

There is a lot to learn about the car and still learning. Have had no issues.
Like having the no hands for calls. Love how it handles. Turns so sharply on turns. That's what I liked about my last murano
Will address phone volume issue with dealer at first service.
Situational awareness assistance while driving.
So far so good. No problems or worries!

Better gas milage. Would like to be alerted if drifting.
Look and comfort
I have always wanted the touch pad my vehicle did not come with and I've wanted a Burt orange color that I didn't see when I purchased the vehicle.????
It drives nice but I really miss my power ?? to raise up when operating.
Styling of interior and exterior
When starting with the push button the engine seems to rev really high. Just seems odd.
interior and how it rides
I miss my camera system is had in my Rouge it was awsome
It's beautiful
Drives like the Maxima that I traded.  Ease of getting in and out of seats as well as the cargo space.  My dog loves to ride in the back.
"Mpg is advertised falsely    Driving very carefully the best city mpg I have gotten is 16, with 14 as the average. That is not the 21 promised and one of the main reasons I chose the murano"
Comfort
"Handling is less sporty than maxima with lots of understeer. Site lines over front fender from same side front seat is more obscured than view directly ahead. With CVT and car based design, expected a few more highway mpg's."
Interior is well designed and attractive. Love the ventilated/cooled sears. Seats are outstanding for long distance travel. Exterior is attractive but not distinguished enough from lower level models.
I like my car.  Could be quieter as far as road noise and seats could be a little cushier.  Otherwise good car
blind spot and lane change warnings
I love my Murano but the tilt of the cowel drives me bonkers because I can see dirt spots. I am also a little concerned about how high the engine revs every time I turn on the ignition.
The comfort and style of the vehicle. I do miss the turbo of my Juke a little though.
The console squeaking and the power liftgate noise could be fixed.
The intelligent cruise control features.
"I love the car and all of the bells and whistles that come with it. I wish the sun roof and shade cover had different settings as when I close the sunroof, the shade automatically closes also and have to reach up and stop the shade."
The different camera views. Totally awesome!!
Not much because I love my vehicle maybe better on the gas mileage that's about all.
The ride it gives and how comfortable it is
There is a reflection from the dashboard silver chrome on the window that interferes with the side view mirrors. This could be corrected by redesigning the silver stripe on the dashboard and eliminating it from proximity to the side windows.
Roominess and technology (navigation and camera system rear and side views)

No complaints except for the discoloration of the leather seats. Otherwise a great vehicle.

I like the overall features - it's very like our previous 2011 Murano but the Technology features are outstanding!
"1. Update the navigation map; we bought a 2016 model, yet the most current map is from 2015; several newer roads near us are not yet on the map, which limits our use of the navigational system. 2. Add a height adjustment to the front passenger seat. Shorter people who sit there have limited outside visibility."
"We like: the roominess of the interior, the external design, the interior leather upholstery, quality construction."
OK
Comfortable!
I previously owned a 2011 Murano and feel that this one doesn't have as much room in the front seat.
I think the keyless entry is by far the best feature.
I would like softer seats.  I would like passenger seat in front to have full electronic movement same as the driver side.  I used to drive a Cadillac and was used to very soft seating that was fully electric on both front seats.
"I haven't driven it much, I have been sick however it handles well and I like it as well as expected.  I did drive a Murano almost 2 years previous to this one."
"Sunroof is a little noisy at highway speeds, but not anything I can't live with. I'd rather have the sunroof than not have it. :-)"

"As previously stated, the storage area in the door panels is inadequate"
"The exterior look, the interior look and it is comfortable to drive/ride in.  I think the road noise impact is better than my 2012 murano"
Better overall paint quality.
Its style and riding comfort.
Love the styling and looks!  inside and out  It is a bit difficult to see over the hood.  maybe the seats should sit a bit higher.  My husband noticed when driving hilly roads in TN that it's difficult to see the road when going uphill.  Not as good of visibility for the driver as our 4Runner had.
"Love the styling, the interior is beautiful!  The exterior lines are great.  Love all the safety features and heated seats and wheel.  The front seats are the most comfortable we've ever had in any car.  Handles well, AWD is great in snow."
more head room getting in and out of car
Nothing-----I love it
Good vehicle
Awd
Gas mileage is not the best.
The exterior look is unbeatable
"Hate the blind spot rear. No side window towards back. If I turn my head to back up or check around me, all I see is car no window to see out.  Very poor design. Yes it looks sleek but lost viewing area to side n backing up.   Hope to sell this car in spring mostly because of this.  We also put a hitch on and this vehicle was not designed for hitch so to put a hitch on., it's below rear bumper almost dragging on ground. Bad design there too"
Drives quiet. Good storage in rear

"Remote interaction with vehicle via mobile devices i.e. remote start, unlock etc.  Heated steering wheel  Mirror tilt while in reverse is not needed with surround view cameras"
Sleek body style & front console
Comfort of seats and it's very quiet
"Redesign the glove box, the in-door storage, and the low beam headlights. Consider adding auto-sensing wipers and better keyless entry to the Platinum models."
"Make sure batterys are new. Check finish on out side. Molders need to have plastic parts tuned for rattles on clips. Bumper Reflectors, dash trim."
New body style look more modern.
we've had a Murano before and we like everything about them so we  got a new one.
Will not buy another Nissan product. Overpriced for what's offered and cheaply made.
The seat is comfortable and is just the right height personally for me getting in and out. Although the seat stability is lacking.
Improve the Bluetooth quality.  My Toyota never had Bluetooth connection issues. Very disappointed in the quality and  the  lack of follow up with the Omaha Woodhouse dealership.
Comfort of  seats and  smooth ride
You should provide a good stereo system in every level of vehicle.. There is a major jump from the S to the SL.  Also its at a cost....
Body Style and sporty interior
"I'm really satisfied with my new vehicle, no suggestions for improvement at this time."
"The navigation system, comfortable seats and that the vehicle is quiet."
"The only thing I would add are sensors on the outside of the car that show you are getting closer to something (in the garage for instance), rather than having to use only the camera."
"Performance, appearance, options.  This is my third Murano and the improvements were great from the prior model."
It feels like a luxury vehicle.
I wish it had rain sensing wipers and a cargo compartment in the back lick my 2009 Murano
Exterior appearance
"Comfort, ride, predicted reliability on consumer reports, exterior appearance."
Better remote starter.   More lumbar support
The look and style
"The steering wheel has too small an area for hands at the 5 and 7 oclock positions. I do not have big hands, yet I can only comfortably get 3 fingers on the wheel in these 2 locations, since this is where we are to grasp the wheel now instead of the old 1 and 11 oclock positions.  We also have a 2011 Buick Enclave and that steering wheel has the proper amount of space for my 4 fingers."
"Heated seats, the ability of the vehicle to slow down by itself as you come up on a vehicle ahead of you with cruise set. The forward and backup cameras. Side warning as well."
I love my car!!!!!
Everything! The room!
Change the remote starter...hate that I can't get the app access and hate that I don't know if my car has started or not
Love the look and radio
Remote start should be 2 way so u know it's started .

Window vent visors to prevent water coming in when it rains

"I like its safety features, it's body curves and how the interior feels more roomy than it appears."
"Regarding the sunroof,  full glass roof; I wish the interior shade could be stopped halfway and still allow the sunroof window to opened (tilt up or full open)"
I am enjoying the idea of the crossover vehicle itself. Also the seating is very comfortable on long trips.
Better gas mile and better acceleration is crucial. I feel Murano is not even match up to Rouge at a higher price.
Driving handling and comfort level in the car.
Can't think of a thing. I love it!
The 360 camera so I can tell exactly where I am when parking.
Excellent vehicle in the way it drives.
Front passenger seat needs full controls.  Cooled seats are noisy.  Cup holders are at an odd angle.
"Heated steering wheel, heated/cooled seats, gas mileage, and headlights."

Needs to get better gas mileage. This is the most important.  The next model needs to have the charger port moved so it is easier access and I can get used to where the start button is.
It looks really cool!!!  I've had many compliments on how good it looks.  It is very comfortable to drive and it drives smooth.  I feel comfortable in the vehicle and I feel safe.  There is plenty of storage and it fits my family.
The quality and reliability.
I don't think I have had it long enough or put it to a test on the highway to see if any major issues come up. I have not brought it in for service either so I am looking forward to that  experience to see if the quality of service is as good as advertised.
"Looks, features, comfort, workmanship with the exception of the issues outlined related to the exterior paint, brand reliability."
It has been one of my favorite vehicles.
Design
"Paint was scratched on delivery, minor but still scratched.  Also, for a new vehicle, too many miles.  It was brought in from Little Rock, which explains some of the mileage; however, a trip from Little Rock doesn't justify over 300 miles on a new car. To be honest, I would have refused delivery if it wasn't for the fact I didn't want to cause problems for my salesman."
Roominess and it's pretty
Nothing I can really think of I absolutely love my Murano
Everything but mostly the interior everyone loves the way it looks
Fix the ding. Scotchguard the seats. Install the bumper guard!
Beautiful car that is comfortable.
I LIKE IT AS IT IS
"Interior console button missing upon delivery along with soiled driver headrest and back of same seat. Car was not detailed by the dealership as promised and was centered smelling of onions. Back hatch lift did not open; however that was fixed at dealership before delivery. I had car detailed on my own. Unfortunately, we have not heard back from salesperson/dealership regarding missing Console button."

Kept the same Navigation system functionality as in the 2014 model.
Rides and drives nice
We love it & dealership promised to fix electronics.  Add lane departure system
Hard to say but really do like electronics & fact that my insurance rate went down vs 3 yr old car that I traded.
"1) The seat backs on the rear seat are too vertical. A slight recline would be more comfortable.  2) Poor vision to the rear of the vehicle. This could easily be resolved by installing a second rear camera in the area of the roof antenna that could be activated while driving and viewed on the 8"" dash monitor."
"Styling, size, comfort and performance are all excellent."

The last plastic on the bottom  corner of drivers seat is to sharp. When driving in shorts it hurts your leg
My only complaint is as I have stated is the awkward phone system.
"We love everything else about the vehicle.  The driving experience, handling, style and comfort are all exceptional."
Back up camera should beep when getting too close to an object or vehicle that is really my only complaint.
Its gorgeous
"There is a blind spot behind the passenger seat of the vehicle which makes me very nervous. A friend of mine, who also has a Murano, said she has the same problem."
I like the look and room in the vehicle.
Driving it.......:)
"I feel that even though I love the look of the vehicle, it comes at the expense of visibility.  Since visibility is compromised because of the design, a blind spot detection system should be standard on all trims.  Also, since the vehicle screams luxury by it's styling, I'm sure at least a driver's side power seat could have been included without adding that much to the cost.  Other than that, she is a beauty."
The style and acceleration.
Fuel efficiency needs to be improved
The design is incredible
Better gas mileage
Comfort and connection with devices. Locking of alarm on handles. Don't need faub

The back seat is very uncomfortable and not adjustable.    I wish that they didn't stand up so straight.  Poor comfort and too straight up.
The smoothness when driving.
i have been told by the service mgr that nothing can be done with the excessive noise. I have to turn the radio on high volume to void the noise out

"I'm fan of NISSAN.  My first car was 240 SX.  Dream car is Skyline GTR and I do enjoy driving my new Murano, Just not satisfy how the drive shaft and shock need to replace.  Bit disappointed"
The interior space.  Love the panoramic roof.  Kids love it.  Like the LED headlight and cameras for parking.  Rear view blind spots was a big issue but the cameras helped.
"Nothing, This vehicle is great!"
Right now the heated seats. (its very cold in the morning)
Improve the sun visors to cover the corners...easy to resolve I'm sure
Uses regular gas.   Gets better gas mileage than my 2004 mutant.  Quiet smooth ride  handles snow and ice very well!  Easily holds 4 sets of golf clubs for travel!  Dealership where I bought it has fabulous service!  Love the power of the v6 engine and the CVT transmission is the best!??
I'm very satisfied with this vehicle.
Overall - everything. There is not one thing that I would say I like best.
tailgate is difficult to open.
the new styling
Heat and filling can be improved
Nissan reputation
Increase fuel economy

Nothing at this time
It's a smooth ride

"Look, feel, handling"
Better gas mileage
The smooth ride!
Nothing at this time...I'm lovin' it!
"The smooth, safe ride!"
"Stop-start technology! It's a hybrid vehicle, after all, and that's the only dimension of fuel efficiency that I feel my Murano is missing."
Unparalleled combination of safety and style
"Auto retract side mirrors, front camera."
"Very good ride, probably the best looking SUV there is."
better interior lighting around the headlight switch or make it illuminate like the controls on the steering wheel.
its new & the ride is smooth
The windshield could be wider like that of the Rogue. Because of its width it limits vision
Except for my opinion on the small windshield I like everything else
Comfort
improve fuel economy
all ok except fuel economy

"As mentioned before, the other problem is of concern."
Styling and performance
How it rides and holds the road in all weather conditions
Love the vehicle. Possibly consider rain sensitive wipers.
"The way it handles, and the comfort of the leather seats"
"its my third murano. if it works ,stick with it."
"I own a 08 Frontier and I love it, but in the the Murano I miss the simple climate controls. For example I really don't like having to press the mode button multiple times and visually verify with the screen to see where the air setting is at. In my Frontier i can reach out and twist the knob exactly the number of clicks i need to put hot air on my windshield without taking my eyes off the road. Not at all a big issue, but I find a bothersome trend in the auto industry as a whole."
The peace of mind that a new quality vehicle will keep my growing family safe. After all...its a Nissan!
More interior compartment space front council sticks too far in the back    Contour of the car throws all the dirt on the back trunk  wash the vehicle dirty the next day on the truck only    Low Visibility back window    Get a reflection from the vents chrome dead center of the outside mirrors    A visual distraction when you look in the side mirrors   I showed the dealer he had agreed
Beautiful looking vehicle nice interior features handles well  good ride
"I love the color and the exterior.  But when I tell people about it, I always tell them about the seat that remembers where I want it."
no suggestion.
overall performance.
upgrade and improve the navigation system.  Little more improvement on the fitup.
"driving comfort, quietness"
Heated stressing wheel
More useful spaces in the driving area.  The center console and glove box are large but awkward to use.  Also the location and number of plugs for electronic devises could be improved.
"Although my relationship with my new car is young, I am very pleased at this point.  It is an easy and comfortable drive.  I'm very pleased with the ease of operation of the information and entertainment touch screen."
"Great vehicle, only wish was a cheaper price!"
All of it!!!!!!
Knobs for radio and temperature control are too close together.
It is roomy.
"The driver's seat is very uncomfortable and it is lacking some things that are standard on similar priced cars.  (lumbar support, passing lane notifications, etc...)"
Appearance
"When behind tractor trailers on highways the Murano shimmys! My son's 2016 Murano does it , too! Have you taken too much weight off. It is 400+ lbs. less than my 2012 Murano was."
Style.
Reflection on side view mirrors from interior is very disturbing. A sound to accommodate the light on a car approaching on either side.

seat belt clap flies back to position and the side panel between the 2 doors always gets nicked due to it unless you hold the set belt till it goes back slow

was shocked to realize lane departure warning was NOT included with the number of camera views the car possesses.

not much maybe a little quieter and smoother but overall very nice
style and interior and all the options especially the bose speakers
"More continuing attention should be paid to maintaining infotainment systems by providing fixes for issues.  Upgrading to a new vehicle should not be the only ""fix"".  I feel that vehicle manufacturers neglect the maintenance and software updates for existing systems and only concentrate on new systems.  Little is done to fix minor issues in existing owner's infotainment systems."
"The styling, ride and technology offered."

More luggage room
Style and interior
"comfortable ride, good acceleration,"
The auto lift rear hatch should be standard as well as power seats.  Fuel mileage has   been disappointing.
Look of it inside and outside is marvelous and the smooth ride and front seats are exceptional.
"Please refer to my earlier comments, etc. Nothing so major that some minor tweaks can certainly be accomplished. Over-all, the vehicle is very nice although I have just 4, 600 miles on it. I'm not certain how the air conditioner will perform since I purchased the vehicle on October 1, 2016---outside of the normal air conditioning season."
"I do like the way it handles....very quick response to steering wheel movement, etc. It appears to have good pickup as well."
"Seat belt strap has a tendency to twist so have to be very careful when pulling it out to buckle. I do not like the black triangle panel on the back, side corners. I asked if I could replace with collie of vehicle but was told all are black. The blind spot in both back corners is a huge problem, one I thought I could deal with but cannot."
It is fun to drive. Good power.
Make the compartment between the seats more accessible.
The exterior and interior colors are exactly what I wanted. I like the back-up camera and the forward camera.
Better in town gas mileage.
Trunk space.
Nothing yet..still too new
Looks and safety features
"Wish it had the rain sensing wipers.  My other Platinum Murano did.  Also, wish it had the lane assist that my Atima had on it."
Comfort
Simpler way to figure out how are everything works.
I like everything about the vehicle
This is a fantastic automobile. I can't think of a single thing at this time I would change.
The interior is stunning.

"The safety features, the comfortable ride, and the technology included. We continue to choose Nissan based on included safety features, and reliability. This vehicle has that and much more."
"Better factory speakers, unlock maps while driving so passenger can input info, plastic on seat side bolt on tight so foot does not catch"
Engine smoothness and acceleration
"The only thing besides the feet getting warmer would be to have some kind of cell phone holder by the dash, I have to use an app on my phone for realtime traffic updates since I have iPhone"
Quality
Nothing. I love my new vehicle
Comfort and style
The steering g is way to light and makes me overly cautious. I have found it bordering dangerous
"The look and feel, the seats!"
like my new car and am very satisfied  would have liked it to have better fuel mileage
Like the look of the car both interior and exterior and they way it handles and drives
driving noise
how the vehicle overall
The car can be done much better if the ride is little softer also the steering feel can be a little bit more later since the steering feel is too heavy the car feels heavy while driving the USB connection needs to be fixed since it keeps freezing while playing songs it can be annoying when you're driving for a longer time the windows needs to be reduced
Nothing... exceptionally very well vehicle put together. Best car on the market.
The technology
"I would prefer a handle on the back hatch. I fear that, over time, the paint will look worn where I touch it to close the back hatch each time. Also, the vehicle rolls about 2 to 3 inches each time I turn it off and let off the brake. Not far, but still a concern in tight situations."
The gas mileage is great. I love the bluetooth connection capabilities. The interior is very roomy for passengers and it's a comfortable ride.
Color       gas mileage.  Everything
I love the vehicle.   It doesn't get as good gas mileage as I would like.  The comfort is great when driving.
The way it looks.  The roominess is has.  The comfort of the drive.
"The exterior, interior and the technology offered"
I love it and the issues would not change my buying decision.
All of it.
I love the way in rides and looks!
I believe it's exactly what I wanted and needed for my current life style.
Exterior Style and engine performance.
Lots of road noise.  Not as quiet as I expected.
Most everything
"Let me take it to a local Nissan dealership, or body shop, and get a second opinion on a repair of the headlight, agreeing to foot the repair bill short of total replacement. It should be noted that a headlight assembly retailing at $1100 is ridiculous."
Just about everything. Every time I drive it (it's my wife's car) I comment to her on how much I like driving it. It is the best car purchase I've ever made.
"nothing, for the price it is just fine!"
"nav, body style"
More basic features in the SV model would greatly improve the functionality of the vehicle. Such features include a homelink system and a driver seat setup memory for multiple drivers. Both of those are standard features on most vehicles in this class and category. I was disappointed to not find them
"Appearance, drive and interior space."
Make the option of full power passenger seat available
Comfort of seats  Quietness  Interior fit and finish
This is an awesome car!  I can't think of anything to improve on except maybe a built in cappacino machine.  :)  Cheers!
I feel safe in this car and it is so conformable to ride in.
Firmer ride
Interior design andcomfort
I would really like this iphone texting answering feature fixed as I just bought the car and didn't know about the android/iphone issue when I bought the car.  I plan on keeping it and this is a feature I think is a safety issue and a convenience.
"I like the way it handles and the safety features like cameras, and the auto braking and safety beeps. :)"

"Less chrome on the exterior, less plastic fill ins on the exterior......liked the previous clean exterior lines better.  Interior is still first rate as is the transmission, engine and overall handlilng."
"Value.........compared to the Acura MDX / RDX, Hyundai Santa Fe and Lexus RX which I cross-shopped, the space, interior, ride and performance for the price paid was in my mind clearly better."
Better fuel economy
Drives very nice and I feel very safe init.

I LOVE THIS VEHICLE THE BEST OUT OF THE LAST TWO PURCHASES IT HAS EVERYTHING ON IT I WANT ONLY THING IS THE SOUND SYSTEM WASN'T AS GOOD AS ON MY ROGUE
TOO MANY TO MENTION
"I was skeptical about the appearance of the wheels when I purchased the Murano.  I thought the darker wheels would grow on me, but they really haven't.  I would definitely like the chrome wheels better."
"I like the overall appearance, the smooth ride and all the electronic features."

I would not change anything about my vehicle
Smoothness when driving
"The silver trim looks cheap. The gas mileage computer never equals what my fuel economy is, always lower than computer says."
"Roomy,nice looking"
"I feel like I have bought a faulty vehicle (lemon). This vehicle has not lived up to my expections of my friend's Nissans or past Nissans I have owned. With the problems I have experienced at such an early stage (less than 30 days and 2600 miles), I feel like the company should have replaced the vehicle with a different vehicle (same make and model). This one has not been reliable and I am not confident that I can drive it long distances without being stranded with a broken down vehicle."
"It's look and sportiness, seat comfort, ride, overall rich interior and creature comforts."
Interior roominess.
I can't think of anything
High tech  of everything
"Placement of cameras, tend to become blurry in poor driving conditions"
comfort of the seats
Fix the cruise control issue
The comfort and looks of the interior and exterior
"Vehicle still emits a 'burn-off' smell after 3,600 miles of driving and 3 months of ownership.  Not sure what is causing it, but hope this will go away soon.  Rear liftgate could be re-engineered for easier use."
Comfortable ride.
I have not taken in my vehicle for my paint issue yet.  I was going address that issue when I have my first oil change.   I am hoping the dealership will address/correct the issue.  Your quality control should have been able to see the bad paint when they inspected the finish however I understand sometimes things are missed.
"Great looking, roomy, fairly quiet, quality ride and handles well."
"this is my 4th Nissan.  Based on the quality of the vehicle upon delivery I'm not sure I will purchase a 5th.  The vehicle had less than 100 miles on it but it was scratched on the outside and the interior was stained & torn.  Dealership would not replace, only repair.  Dealership has had the vehicle more days than I've driven it."
engine performance
Better and more of a sport ride ( less float and vibration and better gas mileage) more up to date lane keep and braking with front and back Seancers. Our 2013 forester is fare better
Bring car up to date in saftie and mileage
"Style,features and response"
Better mileage and vision out of Car when backing  or turning
"When using door latch, echo of steel in door sounds thin or hollow, impression is ""cheaper"" grade of base steel used in door panels or less attention to interior of doors."
"I would say if they (Nissan) could fix all these problems, but I don't know how feasible that is as they are more annoyances and I don't know that anything is specifically broken. It would be nice if all the latest updates could be done to it, (Navigation, apps, etc). I think I was expecting a better vehicle than the one I had for the substantial price increase I paid. I paid 10k more for this vehicle than I did for my previous car (when new) and I felt I got more of a deal on that car than this one and all the features on that car worked."
"I like that I am higher off the road. Coming from a sedan prior, I was tired of being blinded by headlights from the cars behind me at night. I also like having a vehicle with AWD now that it's snowing. I find traction to be much better and the ability to accelerate from a stop in snow is quite beneficial when pulling out onto a main street. The engine feels smooth when idling and powerful when trying to merge onto the expressway. I like the styling of the exterior very much as well. It does give that luxury look."
I like the space between the seats--the console but seems longer and harder to put things in the back from the front.  But truly a beautiful car.
everything.  This is my third Murano....best yet.
"If you could stop the wind noise when I am driving, that woud be great.  It is annoying. Otherwise I am happy with my Murano."
"The performance when I hit the gas peddle.  The new body style.  The interior.  The navigation system, sound system, heated and cooling of the seats. The sunroof dispite the wind noise, and the ability to start it from a distance.  Overall I LOVE my MURANO !!!!!"
"Wish the horn didn't beep for remote start. Overall a great vehicle. Love the interior lights. Subtle but functional. Love the options of dashboard settings.   When navigation is on and speed limit is 50 and driver driving at maybe 60, have the speedometer flash as a reminder that you are 10mph over speed limit."
Love heavy secure feeling while driving. Love 6 cylinder.
I like the Murano better than any vehicle I have owned.  I only hope it gives me no problems later.
I like the ride and the interior and exterior appearance.
"As I said before, the driver and passenger temp regulation is less than ideal. Also the back cargo area is rather small for such a large vehicle, and the available cargo cover is cumbersome and doesn't serve its purpose very well."
"The beautiful interior and exterior.   Also, the smoothness of the ride."
Sometimes the passenger window won't go down.
"Handling, steering audio, most navigation, appearance"
"Very noisy when window is down, nice and quiet when closed.  Maybe a design tweak to help with noise when window is down.  Other than that this vehicle is wonderful."
"handling in snow, interior and exterior design, navigator"
Am enjoying the murano and getting used to it
Comfort of the seats
"styling, technology, comfort"
Double check the vehicle before delivering to make sure everything works
Extremely comfortable and looks modern
nothing to add
it drives very smooth and is very comfortable to be in. The look is sharp and clean as well.
"I don't like the visibility; there is blind spot on either side.  The front side (left right side posts that connect to roof ) blocks my vision.  It is really annoying.  Also, I was shocked to find that there is no rear window fluid dispenser to clean the back window.  Also, it is hard to clean the top of the back window.  There is this thing protruding at the top of the rear window and it doesn't allow me to use squeegee to clean it.  I don't have rear-window cleaner and I can't use squeege."
Performance and looks.
So far everything is fine.
"Handling,preformance,styling."
"Really the wind noise is the only bothersome problem with the car,  love, love, love the rest of it."
"Love the comfortable ride, truly a driver's car.  Navi package, body appearance, comfort of seats, wish the gas mileage was a bit better but for the style car I shant complain."
Nothing it's perfect
The sales guy Ryan Wilmot
"I'd like better visibility from the drivers seat.  The pillars and the dash board obstruct the drivers' view.  I'd like better resolution from the cameras, particularly the rear view camera.  The birds' eye camera view is a really nice feature - I like using it to park the car.  In fact, it is almost necessary for parking the car due to the poor visibility from the drivers seat - can't really tell where the fenders are, or where the car is in relation to the curb."
"comfortable seats, great sound system, heated seats including rear seats, and heated steering wheel.  AC in seats is nice in summer.  Handling and responsiveness is excellent in dry, wet, or snowy conditions."
I wish there would be a better way to keep the back window cleaner.  It is constantly filthy and the little wiper and window wash can't keep up.
The overall ride is really great.  It is a very roomy and warm car.
Have a split navigation screen so one side is the map and the other could be the radio.  Need more storage by the cup holders.  I don't like that the seat moves each time I get in and out - I would like the option that this doesn't occur.  The volume of the speakers is not great.  I would like the volume button higher on the steering wheel.
Appearance.
Figure out how to eliminate the vibrations. We live in a snow environment for at least 1/3 of the year

Make this report shorter
Wife is happy
ever thing id good
the looks
Very little to cite for improvement.  If anything - small matter - I would like the compass to display somewhere all the time besides as an optional program on the dashboard.
Just about everything.
Sunroof issue is major concern. I understand things may need to be tweaked on new cars after delivery. The response from Nissan however is extremely poor. I would expect more on a $40K vehicle.
"Nothing, it is a wonderful vehicle."
This is my second Murano and I find it a wonderful vehicle.
Cabin/ wind noise
Depedibility
"Better standard speaker system, better exterior colors. But really, I love my new car."
"Smooth acceleration, stable turning, good handling even in snow, comfortable seats, nice interior finishes, lots of interior space."
"The interior layout and instrumentation/technology is beautifully laid out and a huge improvement over my 2012 Murano Platinum. Love the extra 2"" in length and 1.5"" in width. Handling is great and the zero gravity seats and ""just right"" seat bolsters continue to set Nissan apart from any competition.  Especially the BMW, Audi, and Mercedes manufacturers who seem to think we need hard seats with bolters that cut into your thighs.  With your many improvements you had to scrimp on front/back storage compartments.  The depth on sides of doors to store maps or other things isn't deep enough to hold much of anything.  The back seating drawer that was part of console in my 2012 Murano disappeared to make room for heating controls.  What I stored in that drawer had to be located in other storage area of vehicle."
"Handling, ease in using technology and it's layout and finger touch ability. Quieter. Driver view of instrumentation directly in front of drive as part of DIC varieties. Better MPG. Love the cruise limit setting (by distance in feet) that automatically slows vehicle down when I get too close to vehicle in front of me. Pus the crash avoidance."
Comfort of driving the vehicle along with the amenities
"I think rear visibility could be better, but the electronic warning system work well."
The seats are great.
The luxury and feel of an SUV
Nothing!  I love my Murano!  It is the best car I have ever owned.
The safety features like front and back cameras. I can actually parallel park!  The side mirror area lights that there is a car in my blind spot. It is impossible to pick one thing
suspension is a little too firm
"looks, interior, gas mileage"
I would love to have an outside keypad.
Lane tracking
Every thing
The USB port is in an awkward spot. Not easy to get a USB in and out of the tiny spot it's in. The little door that closes over it easily gets stuck if shut on the cord. Seen a couple of the doors broke in the rentals at the dealership. Bad design
It looks great.
Size and style
We're very happy with our purchase.  We were very well attended to by the Nissan dealership and were given a good deal on the chosen vehicle. We have had no problems with the vehicle and enjoy it when driving.
Looks - it looks really contemporary and yet is very comfortable inside.  The interior fit and finish is quite good and the vehicle drives and rides beautifully.
"very proud to own this Murano - just 2 small notes to tell you about:  1) the sun visor is not cut properly on both driver and passenger sides, does not fully block out the sun; 2) driver seat is moulded a bit high so that the driver's thigh does not sit properly on the seat.  after longer periods of driving, it is noticeable.  It seems it was made for a thinner driver.  Other than these little notes, the vehicle is AWESOME - I would buy it again even with these issues."
"sporty look, sporty sound of engine, good acceleration power"
The CVT transmission slows the performance of the vehicle.  I have had other Nissan/Infiniti vehicles with 3.5 and 3.7 engines and the power delivery is much better.  In instances where I need to accelerate quickly it lacks.  Very disappointed with the fuel economy.  It is about the exactly same as my RAM 1500 5.7 Hemi engine (16.8 mpg mixed driving in cold weather).  For a 3.5 and this little weight I expected low 20's for mixed driving.  The interior is nice and easy to drive and operate - the lack of an integrated garage door opener is really odd for a 35K car.  I had to search my junk drawer for the old openers again and replace the batteries - it's been that long since I had a car that didn't have an integrated opener.  Seems like small potatoes to add it as standard.
"Ride is solid - no squeaks or rattles -  this is very very important to me.  Easy to take on extended highway driving - comfortable.  The navigation is one of the BEST I have ever used - as well as the information systems (weather, gas, sports).  These are very well done."
Disappointed with the number of trips an time that it took to resolve the problem. Also I had a trailer hitch put on my vichcle and they  put the wrong size on after I made an extra trip to double check the size.
I like the vichcle but disappointed with with the service.
looks
Wish I had requested cooling for he seats!
Room inside & easy handling.
Feature like neck support can be added to head rest of the seats for driving comfort
Leg room
I did not realize when I purchased the Murano that the back trunk lid was totally manual. I thought I just couldn't find the button to lower the lid. At times I find it hard to open and close. I also am not used to the hesitation in the vehicle when you are backing out and then put it in drive. It seems to hesitate before taking off.
It is very smooth driving. I love the way it handles. The ride is comfortable and fairly quite.
The smooth and comfortable drive
Road and wind noise needs to be addressed.  Bluetooth/phone connecting needs to be addressed along with garage door opening.
the room
Great car and feel safe! Observed some air noise on drivers side window.
Body style and interior!
"2nd row space is lacking... the console makes it almost impossible for a 5th person to ride in the middle. We drive a lot for kids activities and a gym bag won't even fit in the floor between console and seat. Maybe the second row can be moved back and I just don't know how.   I need to take vehicle to dealership to have some of other issues addressed -blue tooth, USB and carpet coming up."
"Much better gas mileage than my Acadia had, love the look of exterior and interior, very comfy seats"
"The trunk, back door lift, need to be automatic and should be able to pop open from the inside of the vehicle or with the key.  I really hate how I have to open the hatch by hand and it is hard to lift up and pull down.  I simply hate it, didn't realize it would be that hard to operate."
"I like the comfort of the seats, I like the bluetooth hookup, I like the roomy space front and back seating.  I haven't figured out all the other features yet."
"Ilove this Murano,,,still learning everything about it.this is the first Nissan I have ever owned.The murano is so Quiet ,I love this about it.Drives good another plus"
Not really anything.
"The seat belt gets overlapped (doubled up) too easily, inside the sliding part that connects to the seat bottom. It is then very hard to get it to slide out so that it fits comfortably.  Also, the Bluetooth phone system lists all of the functions each time you push the phone button. It would be great if you could push the button and tell it who to call and have it call for you. That is very annoying. I drive and use my phone for work a lot.  I love the look of the car and the power it has."
"The styling, how the tail lights conform to the body in sharp angles. How the Murano and New Maximas look like brother and sister. It has a lot of power for entering freeways and passing. Nothing WIMPY about this car."
"It isn't as ""tight"" feeling.  It isn't as comfortable. I am really not happy with the car."
"My vehicle has had several service issue and I had problems getting repairs done properly.  Service reps that return calls!!!!  I always had to call to find out if my car was ready.  Voice-mail goes unanswered.  Better customer service, clean Nissan rental interiors, and Nissan rentals that match my car class."
A question I cannot truly answer until the repairs are complete.   I dread driving it because I fear I will discover another issue.
I really like how it looks and the smoothness of the ride.  The seats are very comfortable.  I also like the sound system and GPS.
Better communication among team and customer. I purchased the vehicle in September.  Part was not ordered until November.  Salesmen lied about ordering the part. Issue was not resolved until corporate customer service was contacted. My dedication to Nissan vehicles is waning because of sales staff.
It Classy! I have a classy ride without the high price name!
fix the tailgate
style and safety features
So far so good on my first purchase of a Nissan vehicle ever. I am already deciding on my next Nissan. Even though it's a 6 cylinder vehicle at times it feels like a 4.  I am starting to hear things rattle in the trunk but it could be that the spare tire and tools could be loose.
"stylish, comfortable, and eco friendly"
Give me another car that doesn't smeil.
"My wife and I loved the car for the first two weeks and were glad we had purchased it, however there is nothing i like about the car now that it smells so badly.  The foul odor has ruined the entire new car experience and overshadows anything you can say good about the car. I'm sure if we could get this problem fixed, we would love the car again. Ask me the rest of these questions once the smell is fixed."
more val
add the option of add fog lights.  I was not able to add fog lights.  if you know a way to add them please let me know. the system sound quality is not good. please contact me if there is any way to upgrade it. I'll appreciate it.  I've been your customer 3 times in a row. my email is jonajaz3@yahoo.com. your vehicle quality are outstanding.
it's out side design.  is really beautiful and it's quality.  something I forgot to mention before... add a switch to be able to turn on and off the day time running lights.
I am pleased with the vehicle... improvements in new models will help when I consider trading in
It's new! :)    Sleek design
Lower wind noise around the sunroof.
Style and comfortability
"I wanted to buy this vehicle but wanted the leather seat packaged.   I was encouraged to purchase the vehicle without leather seats and would have the leather installed after purchase.   BIG MISTAKE on my part because what I was expecting and what I did recieve was not what I wanted.   Thus, I have a vehicle that reminds me of that mistake and Nissan just didn't give me the response or help I was needing.  Basically, sold me the vehicle and bye, bye...."
The outer look and drive
Paddle shifters on the steering wheel
The luxuriousness of it
"First and foremost, the dealer could have been much more helpful. If he had gotten back to me when he said he would, and if they had been helpful when I started having issues I may have kept the car. I will never buy another Nissan."
Nothing. I got rid of the car.
I am really enjoying this vehicle and right now there isn't anything I would change.
"Ease of use and all the specialty touches like seat memory, heated seats, heated steering and the navigation display behind the steering wheel."
Nothing
"Interior colors, exteriors design."
"Upgrade sound system, have ability to use phone key pad and navigation functions while car is moving-Stupid!!!!!  Steering feels a bit sloppy, but I am comparing to German vehicles."
"Exterior appearance, internal displays, comfort"
Reduce the sunroof wind noise.
The ride is superb.
Comfort & performance
N/A
Everything!
"When detailing maybe remove all the plastic wrap from the vehicles lights, etc..."
My 2016 Nissan Murano looks and feels awesome while still fittin my age group.
"Everything - from the exterior, interior and functionality. It can compete with other luxury SUV's."
Feels cheaper in materials than 2005 model and other her brands
Not sure
Love this car.   The phone/blue tooth issue is really the only problem I have had.  It is extremely frustrating.  I googled the problem and have read this seems to be an issue for others as well
"Very roomy, beautiful car.  It handles well on the road."
"1. Improve gas mileage   2. Light up garage door openers  3 replace radio knob with a thinker one.  4 make a convenient place for Kleenex and a litter bag near the driver.  5 the seatbelt for the 2nd seat middle passenger is very awkward. When it is engaged, it is in my line of vision. Put the seatbelt back on the seat!"
"The cameras, the cameras, the cameras!   The safety features, especially the blind spots on both sides.    Apple Play has not been set up because I am waiting for Nissan to update it."
No acess to open hatch other than opening manually from latch on hatch.  Sometimes the locking system seems some what confusing.
Comfortable to  ride in and is quiet
"I truly cannot think of any improvements as I am fully satisfied with the vehicle.  I was a bit skeptical of how it would handle in the ice and snow, but since driving it now on ice and snow feel much more comfortable and now feel ready to give up my Subaru.  I have been hoping that the dealership would get the Weathertec floor mats in as Weathertec does not ship to Alaska, but that is certainly not the car's fault."
"This is the most luxurious car I have owned and has a distinct exterior appearance so it does not look like every other car in the parking lot.  I also like the fact that when I need that extra burst of acceleration on the freeway, I have it."
"Nothing to speak of! I am driving it to Florida (1200 miles) and hoping to get a decent mpg ! Right now I drive around town so I don't have a good idea for mpg. I love my Murano! Think the seats in my 2010 Murano were more comfortable but lots of things have improved since 2010. Very easy to use the computer, heating/air system, mapping etc.  I have no complaints!"
Like the way it handles/ love the automatic back hatch/ love the ease of the mapping system/ radio/ heating/air conditioning/
nothing
everything
My only complaint is when I lease my Murano the liftgate wasn't working so I had to bring it to Nissan and they removed the entire liftgate and fixed it.
Self parking and Steering wheel heating system should have been part of my Murano
Park and rest system feature.
Comfort
PLEASE FIX THE PROBLEM WITH THE PHONE CONNECTIVITY!!!!!
"The car drives very well, the seat is comfortable.  I wish I wouldn't have an issue with the phone...."
Steering could have more road feel and minor difficulty. With gas pedal location . Otherwise beautiful well made suv
"Gas milage, comfort"
"Love the car, handles so smooth like a luxury car."
How it holds the road.
The drive and handling
"The front seats could have been made a little bit wider in the seat area.  I do NOT have a wide butt ..but my leggs are on the outside portion of the seat.  It would be nice if the outside ""rim"" of the seat would have been on the outside of my leggs so it feels like it is hugging you instead of sitting on it."
"Seat comfort, roominess, control display, and appearance."
Improve the compatibility with current iPhones and also make the Nissan connect and more useful application doesn't. Doesn't seem that it does very much and I don't use.
Nice looking. Very good ride. Very good technology. Except interface with iPhones.
"I would prefer that the fan and temperature controls were switched. It is easier to locate the control know used for the temperature control, and I would personally prefer to quickly locate the fan control then have to look down to find the toggle control."
Look and feel.
"I love the vehicle, with the exception of the phone not pairing at times and the volume jumping all over the place."
The comfort driving and acceleration
"The only 4 things I would change about my car are 1). I would like the back up sensor to BEEP when I am backing up and getting close to an object that is not moving (like a post, etc), and 2) I hate the cup holders.  They are for large cups, and my cup is constantly moving.  I would much rather accommodate for an extra large cup that I might have occasionally, vs the normal size 16 or 20 oz bottled waters/soft drinks that I drink everyday.  If you have a solution for this, I would greatly appreciate it.  3). The cruise control does not work well at all in the mountains, and I have to drive through the NC mountains quite a bit on business.  I would like to be able to utilize this feature in the mountains.  4). I wish the seats were cooled as well as heated... especially with black leather seats in the south!  Otherwise, I love this car!"
"I love the blind spot sensors and other safety features, Bose stereo, and ultra comfortable driver seat!  I love the camera that allows me to see how close I am to other cars after I park.  It drives great-  so comfortable."
"I love this vehicle and how it handles the road, but would have love to have a larger fuel tank in the vehicle."
"I like that it is a mid size crossover, but look smaller and sleek on the outside."
I just feel for the price I paid for my vehicle I should not be hearing the wind or road noise like I do.  Just don't think it was considered
Body style color
Just need to get rid of the rattle on the inside of the vehicle.
Very comfortable vehicle with decent gas mileage for its class.
all good...
"gas miilage, look and ride"
"rust proof or paint all metal on the undercarriage, even my soare tire wheel has rust on the edges of the wheel"
Stylish appearance inside and outside.
Nothing
Everything
Does have a little more road noise than I like.
I like everything about my new Murano....just need to learn to operate everything on it.
"The only issue I have is the GPS navigation. I have not been able to get it to speak to me, and it is very distracting having to constantly look at the screen to make sure I am going right."
It drives well and is exceeding my expectations on gas mileage.
Nothing that I can think of .
The vehicle design and technologic features.
Improve compatibility with Apple products
Comfortable rde
"I've found nothing at this time to improve, I've only had it for 2 months so I'm overall pleased with my purchase so far."
Comfort and style.
The clarity of my radio goes in and out consistently due to reception. It's very noticeable.
The space in my vehicle. I have a very roomy back seat for my teenagers and I love the storage area in the back.
appearance and smooth ride
Need to determine why the gas mileage is 17-18 city and 22-23 highway and correct.
The interior room size and the exterior appearance.
"I feel like there are a few too many blind spots, although the cameras and warning lights do help. Without the warning lights, I'd be in trouble on the interstate."
"I give the look of the Murano a 15 out of 10. I still love it every time I see it. The interior is very sharp also. The engine has plenty of punch, which is great when entering the interstate and on hills. I had a 4 cly. previously, and I will never go back to one of those!"
The handling and maneuverability is very good
appearance
My passenger door will not unlock so I can't open the door.  My windshield cracked from the bottom drivers side to passenger side and down.
"Handles well in all weather.  I like the safety features like blind spot awareness, etc."
I wish it had a voice alert when backing up and something is directly behind you.
I like a lot of things about it but the feature that was really cool was when I realized one putting air in the tires that the Horn was talking when the pressure was correct
Storage could be better in drivers area
Overall looks
interior road noise better than last Murano could be quitter
Comfort quality ride styling and accessories
I wish the front passenger seat adjusted to sit higher- give more lift.
Feel safer driving in the Winter
Everything!
Love it always have had murano
The key fob needs to see major improvements. It's current operation is really unacceptable.
"I would have thought the Platinum level trim would have included, cargo net, cargo area cover and all weather cargo and floor mats. It did not."
The level of quality throughout. I am very pleased with my new Murano.
"The transmission, and all the parking cameras, and the moon/sun roof....and the heated seats and steering wheel"
"They replaced the navigation system, now we need to learn how to use it"
like it
Fix the Bluetooth issues.
Most everything is easy. Comfortable.  Lots of storage space.  Easy to operate.
The camera!
improve gas mileage
I truly love driving my Nissan Murano and the purchase of this vehicle was a great decision.
"It is very easy to get in and out of the vehicle. I have severe arthritis and its ease of entry, the comfortable ride and ease of exit make this the perfect ride for me!"
Everything is good with the car
Everything
"Can't think of anything at the moment, will let you know."
"smooth rides, nice color"
Sound system is not as good as my previous 2009 Murano
"Appearance, driving/handling"
Could have had sun roof.
Lane Assist would be great. As well as an upgrade option for Apple Carplay and Android Auto.
"Drive feel, features, sound system."
"I find the gas pedal a bit touchy, it doesn't always feel smooth with the transmission shifts. I find the steering wheel uncomfortable where the lower part of the center of the wheel meets the wheel. I like to rest my hands in the crook and it is not smooth but rigid and is uncomfortable when driving long periods of time. Don't know if this makes any sense."
the safety features which are new to me. I slid on black ice and I felt the car kept me corrected enough to not hit a wall on an on ramp. I also like the indicator that there is someone on your side and the warning about the car in front. I find the ride very comfortable. I was use to my Diesel VW and it was definitely not as comfortable. I don't like the fact that it has a low spoiler and I can't see where the front of the car starts. I feel in time I will hit something. For the size of the car it gets decent gas milage and like the fact that I don't have to have the highest octane gasoline. That is it off the top of my head
Sometimes the voice to text does not understand what I have said.
"In general, I like the general driving experience with the vehicle.  I also find the infotainment system easy to use.  The icons are easy to understand, and with few exceptions, the voice to text feature response, especially when I use the phone."
More room for drivers legs. Passenger airbag that works
Ride quality
Don't understand why when you start it the engine reves up and the rpm's go way up
the ride and gas mileage
Fix the liftgate so it works properly!!!!!
Engine pick up is great. Interior of car is beautiful.
Having confidence in the dealership would be what I would most like to have changed.
styling
"I got some static from my wife who wanted the automatic trunk opener.  I've been thinking about installing it after market, but I think it would be impossible or too expensive."
The styling and exterior color (Pacific sunset) is awesome.  This is a six cylinder and much more fluid in shifting than the 4-banger I had before.  Most SUV's today are 4 cylinder.  Road noise always bothers me....this Murano appears to have less road noise than my previous  vehicle.
None
Drives like a car.
No improvements
Powerful engine with smooth shifts
See previous comments.
"Everything, but previous comments."
"This is my fifth or sixth Nissan and my second Murano. Both Murano's were SL AWD.  I would rather have the 2012 back for the features that it had that the new model doesn't have. The heated steering wheel, the rain sensor for the wipers, the motorized return on the folded back seats.  The location of the volume controls on th steering wheel were better. The location of the interior gas tank latch is ridiculous. Clearly I would have to spend more money to get the same options  that I had in my old vehicle. I would need to have a new drivers seat that would not cause me pain on long trips. In order to improve how I feel about this vehicle I would have to have an improved or new seat. I am in the car a great deal.  If you're in pain, nothing is good. Otherwise, I can overlook many of the missing features."
It has great power and the overall ride is great as is the sound system.  Some of the alerts to maintenance are very helpful.
"Great look, easy to drive, comfortable and rides excellent"
the steering wheel could have more range of adjustment.  I find it is at a bit too much of a angel with the top feeling far away.
the ride is amazing.  around town or on the highway it is sure footed and comfortable
The cup holders are in an odd location.
The comfort of the ride is beautiful
having a better fuel economy for this type of vehicles.
"the lines of the vehicle, technology and space."
The vehicle is great.  No improvements that I can think of.
It's new and I like the technology and safety features (Blind sport).
Lots of noise from sunroof.. Also no heated mirrors
Look
"more interior room, exterior design"
"Looks, features, the ride, and the engine."
very satisfied with my nissan murano so far.   haven't read entire manual yet but if I need help with some of the features will surely let you know.
everything so far
"Quieter ride, especially on the highway. I should have rented the Murano for a while first, but otherwise, a very comfortable vehicle."
The seats and Sound system
i like the larger size from the previous model and the added conveniences.
I was hoping for better miles per gallon on the car. I had to pay out of my own pocket from a third-party vendor for a cargo cover and a  cargo net. I feel for the price of the vehicle this should have been included.
I like the sleek exterior. I like the well appointed interior. It is a comfortable ride. I enjoy the heated seats and  the heating and air-conditioning work as promised.
"Provide a lighter brown, i.e., saddle brown colored interior. The beige interior is almost white (including the steering wheel!!!) and all other interiors are close to black. Also, better collaboration between dealers would have made my purchase easier. I had to find the car I was looking for by searching websites of 12 dealers. They were unable to locate the car for me."
Looks and radar system. Although the radar system did not alert me when someone backed into the rear corner of my car.
"The fuel economy has been below the advertised 21-27 mpg.  For me the overall average city/highway has been about 17.3 mpg. This has been a big unexpected disappointment to me.  And has cost me more in gas money than I expected. And, more frequent visits to the gas station than I expected.        The road visibility should be improved for both front and rear.     The sound system doesn't allow forward/backward when playing a song.  For example it doesn't let you go to a point in the middle of the song.   Also, I have had problems a few times, when playing music using USB1 drive. It wouldn't read the drive.  No issues yet with USB2.  The sound system has dropped Bluetooth connection a few times or had problems connecting to Bluetooth.     The sides mirror didn't go to the preset positions after a backup last week so I had to reposition them manually (using the setting controls).    If you raise the driver seat, the rear view mirror doesn't bend upward enough to have a good rear view.     Since car cameras are getting very popular, it might be a good idea to have a USB charger on the rear view mirror so if one is using a car camera, the camera can be connected to USB charger on the mirror so there won't a be USB cable running from the camera on the rear view mirror to USB charger on the console."
I like the exterior and interior looks of the car.  The ride is comfortable.  The interior is relatively quiet.  The sound of the sound system is clear and powerful. Having a second USB2 in the rear is convenient. The seat heaters have come very handy so far.
I am used to a faster start when accelerating.  Once I get to 50 mph it picks up power.
I love the sporty look and the lovely leather interior.
better city mpg    less noise from engine better lighting at rear storage area
power from v-6 engine  great seats
Nothing!
"How it drives, smoothly."
"the only drawback to the design of the car, are the blind spots at both ends of the dashboard where the roof supports are located.  When I make a right turn, especially, the right roof support makes it impossible to see the road/curb during the turn.  To compensate, I lean forward to see better but worry that if there is a large pothole there, then I may go into it.  The high hood also contributes to this.  Because I like the design of the car, I am OK with this problem, although it is worse for my wife..."
(1)Design.  I am amazed at the amount of chrome on it. the lines are very neat. (2)Very good to drive long distance and I think that the seats are comfortable and also the lumbar support helps a lot.  (3) Gives a very good solid feel on the road.  Love the Intelligent Cruise Control !!
Less use of plastic on the interior trim.
"The color, Bluetooth and after market leather seats."
better gas mileage :)
everything!
Appearance and interior comfort
Do something with the cvt transmission. Extremely rough at low stop and go speeds
Styling and interior
No issues  noted
"The rear hatch does not go all the way up automatically, and if my hands are full I can not push it up, therefore if I forget to duck, empty my hands and then push up the rear hatch I will bump my head.  Also, the front driver window column between the windshield and the driver door is to thick and obstructs the drivers view during left turns."
everything
Put height adjustments on the front passenger seat.
Edgey design and quality of materials appearance.
This is my 4th Murano I've 12 years. This is the best.
Comfort and looks.
Body style & wheels
My gas mileage has not been quite as high as I expected.  That may be my driving habits.  I love the car
I love the car.  It is beautiful and fun to drive and I have had lots of compliments
My Cadillac srx had a cooler storage area in the back that i miss
Gas mileage
We are truly pleased with our Murano.
Nothing.
It's all great.
I liked the old style where you could put things on the dash and under the radio.
Sporty
"Not sure I like the CVT transmission. Not ""quick"" and a bit noisy"
Looks great inside and out. handles well. Pretty good gas mileage for an AWD
I do not know
It looks good
Just improve the phone interface and make it more straightforward i.e less voice prompts
"It's the perfect size for my needs. Smaller SUVs interiors are like a car (and drive as such) and bigger SUVs have a lot of space that i don't need. The looks are also great , differienciates it from the rest."
quieter cabin
"Improve the gas mileage.  Not nearly as fuel efficient as the Rogue I had previously.  Roomier for the passengers but loss of storage space as a result.  The SD card problem was very annoying and if had not been fixed I might have insisted on a replacement car, it was that disturbing in a brand new car."
Very good looking auto both inside and out.  More comfortable for driver and passengers.  Like the gas tank on the drivers side.  Like the camera system as well.
"When on a call through Bluetooth, the volume is inconsistent, ranging from very quiet and difficult to hear to too loud all of a sudden, during the same call."
"The seats are so comfortable, the car drives very easily and smoothly and road noise is nearly non-existent. Great vehicle!"
Lower prices
Ride
Nothing love it
Nothing
"Appearance, Handling"
Have the hands free text messaging assistant available as promised.  There should be a list of phones that would work with this!
"Great gas mileage on highway,even in mountains. Not so good in town. No other things that bother me. Love the heated seats. Oh don't like it when phone voice ask you if it's 1   Or 2 phone number but guess I'll get use to it"
Heated seats. Great for my back. Navigation sure is great going thru strange cities on my trip
Fix the back window and figure out the rattling noise
"The look,the room,the feel"
Door storage pockets are to shallow to hold anything.
"Steering and the way the car handles, the height of the car that allows you to see the roadway better. Heated seats,backup camera comfort."
1.  Make sure the heater works all the time.  2.  Address rattles.  3.  Address bluetooth functionality (I am inclined not to think it's my phone because all my other bluetooth devices connect without issue).
"It is extremely comfortable.  The ride quality is amazing, and the ride is so quiet--road noise is minimal.  The seats are the most comfortable seats I've ever had in a vehicle.  Well done!  Also, the car is beautiful inside and out.  I get so many compliments on it!  It's a lot of car for the money."
Better gas mileage
Smooth drive and safe
Make the necessary repairs to the loose trim and paint issues.
"Nice vehicle overall. Hope the transmission lasts longer than it did on the vehicle this Murano replaced - '07 Maxima - with 99,000 miles when the transmission went out."
was disappointed because I had heated steering wheel in my maxium and do not have it in this one....just have to get use to SUV     a big difference in that and my car.....
the more I drive it the more I like it.......a good lookin SUV       it seem to be a very comfortable suv....
The negativity of the dealership overshadows the vehicle unfortunately for me. I will NEVER recommend this to anyone.
"It is a new vehicle - I am a hard working, honest person with one child in the military and the other in a public ivy league university. I had been driving a 13 year old vehicle so this was an improvement - however, as i've said before, the negativity of the BERT OGDEN Nissan dealership and poor customer service therein, has overshadowed my new vehicle."
"The rear of the hood ( next to the windshield) has a reverse angle that concentrates the sun's rays right into the driver's eyes.  Two hours on both sides of noon is when the blinding effect is most dangerous.  Shortly after I took delivery I went the the dealership and asked the dealer to put something on the reverse part of the hood so as to defuse the sun's rays. The dealer put some of the clear plastic stuff on that is typically used for the anti pebble nicks you apply on the front of the hood.  It did some good and I think it is enough of diffusion so the rays will not burn a person's eyes. The engineers created a design flaw that I noticed is also on the 2017 hood.  Unless one wears sun glasses, which I don't, and shouldn't have to, to eliminate the hazard, I think you have a dangerous situation.  The glare is enough to blind the driver in the event of traffic either crossing in front or straying into the driver's lane and he being able to take evasive action."
make it easier to use dash selector modes. A return to favorite dash mode would be great. Wife likes to use dash showing MPH for in town driving.. A location of Video lens and proper cloths for cleaning lens when coated with mag chloride. This is probably the best road car for performance and ride comfort since wife had a '96 Lincoln.
"ride comfort, Performance Cruise control (best ever) easy in and out of seats. styling exterior, interior, Cornering and ease of operation of accessories.."
The feel and ride.
"I wish the interior wasn't so black, and maybe more head room for taller people"
"Adding a lift gate to all models of the Murano. Its an expensive SUV and that is a pretty standard feature for vehicles in that class. My sister-in-law's mini van is a base model from 2012 and even she has a lift gate. I was really disappointed when the salesman told me that the one they were selling me had a lift gate, when in fact, it did not."
I like how smooth it is to drive.
I'd love a little more storage
"Everything!  Rides well, comfy, very decent gas mileage,"
"I got the navigation system and standard (not BOSE) system. I must say the sound system is disappointing. My old Ford Escape with factory sound system was significantly better in both quality and volume. I am not sure if it is poor speakers, stereos, or both."
I like the exterior design and the comfort of the ride.
"Would have been nice if passenger seat had ability to be higher or lower, currently only forward and back.  Would be nice if back seat could be brought forward."
Comfort and nice to drive. Nice overall appearance.
don't think anything else can be done as the car is already built and delivered.
"I do like the car, don't get me wrong.  I like the car as a whole.  There is nothing exceptional as I've owned (still do) quality cars."
None
Interior comfort and instrument appearance
I am enjoying it!
Heated seats
"Smooth riding, extra leg room."
Should be able to shoot windshield wiper fluid for back windshield.
Seat comfort
"The quality handling/luxury ride, comfort for my family, fuel economy and style - especially exterior."
"Would love better gas mileage,  also would like a quieter cabin. Overall happy with my new vehicle."
"Comfortable seating, new technology, beautiful appearance."
Back up camera - it should beep when you get near an object.   Cup holders on door should be larger and more accessible. You have to tilt the beverage to get it in the holder.
"Overall, I really like this Murano. The seats are comfortable, I like the blind spot warning."
Quieter ride
Interior and exterior appearance
"First of all, I do love my Murano. However, after thoroughly cleaning the car, I found the carpet  seems very thin & cheap. It also does not go right up to the glove compartment, so the insulation shows. The back seats are very thin.  I love the compartments in the car but they are too small to put anything useful in. Overall the materials seem cheap. Especially compared to my 2004 Murano.  Again, I do love my Murano!"
I love the power! I love the design! I love the wheel rims! I love the color! I love my MURANO!
"Louder warnings when backing up near objects and bright color changes to screens for more indication of warning. Besides yellow indicators, use yellow and red. BRIGHT flashing red within 1-2' of an object or car."
Everything
All is ok
Everything
"Would prefer if garage opener buttons were either illuminated or on the roof, rather than the rearview mirror.  Very hard to locate in the dark."
"We have driven our new car 2 months, come back later to see if any ideas have come up."
"Driving ease and comfort, quiet cabin, safety features,   style and looks. We like it very much and we trust we will enjoy good service as this will be our last vehicle purchase."
I would like the vehicle doors to lock automatically when put in reverse.   It would be nice to have the seat adjustment selections in a more convenient location.   Expected better gas mileage an should get better with a car of such value
It is comfortable and I enjoy driving it.
More rear storage
Everything
I wish it had the disc player that my 2012 Murano had. Liked it much better
The nice ride and overall looks. Have had a lot of compliments
"I would like to have the steering wheel revamped so that it is all wrapped in leather. Get rid of the plastic at the bottom. Make the brightness on the panel and that one small interior light dimmer. Put a light in the glove box. Also, there is a huge glare from the sun that reflects off the curvature of the hood that shines directly into the driver's eyes. This is very uncomfortable when driving long distances on a sunny day. But I love this car! Glad I got it! :-)"
How it looks.
Reduce the cranking rpm's
"trouble free, handling and maneuverability is excellent, size is right for us"
"It's a great mid size SUV.  Can't get anywhere near advertised mileage, though.  At best, 21 MPG.  Interior mother of pearl trim pretty, but margins not very good.  Gaps on dash.The usb port in the front console is almost unusable as it's so difficult to reach. The hood latch is about a 3 on a scale of 1-10.  Not intuitive and doesn't work well.  I'd manufacture this vehicle with smaller wheels to improve ride.  Software on Sirius weather poor versus other vehicles.  You can't reduce range and get any fidelity on cloud picture.  Turns into square blobs.  Use of Command touch screen Excellent.  Sound system odd.  Seems to be front centered and unable to adjust balance more rearward.  Interior colors and comfort of seats - Outstanding.  Voice recognition for commands barely average.  65% of time it gets it wrong.  Exterior design Lines of vehicle - outstanding. Some flimsy plastics on rear bumper and lower wheel cover and same for front grill.   Would suggest that the blind spot warning light occupy the whole side trim mount.  It's too small as designed.  Could be doubled or tripled in height for better alerting."
"Overall Exterior and interior design lines are outstanding.  Interior trim outstanding except for mother of pearl plastic accents.  Margins aren't too good, there.  Seats are outstanding.  Console design - outstanding except for USB port.  Middle of console one almost unusable it's so difficult to get to.  Back storage outstanding."
The navigation system
We had an appointment yet it took my wife 2 1/5 hours to 3 hours to get an oil change and top off her fluid levels wow. This is slowwwwwww
Everything is nice ??
"I love my vehicle! Is safe, easy to drive, confortable !!"
The trimaround the vents reflect in the side view mirrows and is very distracting.  Want to know how to fix it !
"Height and it is a very nice ride,  Did like the 2013 seats better. Also push button lift on the back, navi system."
"All the extras such as:. Leather seats, heated seats, all around camera"
Less wind noise
Everything
The way it drives
All of the camera views
Heated/cooled seats and steering wheel
Gas peddle is small and sometimes foot gets caught on carpet on right side.
"Comfort, appearance, gas mileage, 360 degree camera view for parking, all the safety features. It is a quality vehicle. You need a new dealer in Pascagoula MS."
Passenger seat adjustment should match the drivers. Would like more adjustments for the radio sound
"We saw some models with michelin tires, which is what we have purchased for at least 25 years. We think there is less road noise with michelin tires."
"We like the interior color and trim, sound system, comfortable ride, easy to  get in and out of.  We also like navigation, round view monitor and back up  rear camera,  We really are happy with the exterior color."
"When parking, there is no assist on front as far as about to touch anything in front.  I understand the Rogue will stop on its own if you are about to hit another vehicle ahead, while driving on the road. I would think that feature would be included in this upscale model as well, not just the slowing down. A Camera should be available for front as well as the rear and surroundings while parking."
"Easy to drive  on  long distances, and very roomy when traveling with other passengers"
I love my Murano and I wouldn't change a thing!
I love the appearance both  inside and out. Love all the features too. Right now heated seats and steering wheel are my favorites :)
MOD
All murano should had lights in the door and not have to purchase them.
It handles great on the road and cures down the road really well and the blind spot detection is great.
City Mileage improvement would add value to the vehicle.
Exterior design and seat comfort.
The ride and the looks inside and out
"In a luxury Murano  as we have, there should be a heated steering wheel included in this package! We live in Ohio and have very cold temperatures. Also considering we have been extremely loyal to Nissan since 2004!!!  I am a retired 34 year -service school teacher and I am still loyal to the district I taught school, the students, teachers and parents!!!   Also there was the word Murano lit up on the floor as we entered our 2011 Murano.  My husband and other family members miss that!!!"
We think the 2016 newly redesigned Murano looks very classy.
Love it
Appearance handiling and reliability
The chrome around the heat vents by window provide a glare when looking into the side/rear view mirrors on both the drivers and passengers side.  It is a distraction - especially when there is light shining on it.  A smaller chrome trim might help - or a darker chrome.
I LOVE my new vehicle !!!!
Safety features
I feel as though the drivers seat could go back further. We had a 2006 Murano and it seems like the drivers seat went back further in that.
"The rear camera, keyless ignition, visibility, overall operation of the vehicle."
"Very attractive, very good mileage, lots of ""bells and whistles"""
"Heated seats seems slow to heat compared to other vehicles I have owned.  Also, feel like internal vent system doesn't cover all areas as I feel I have a ""cold"" spot on driver's side at seat level."
Ride quality - quiet and smooth as well as unique look.
"The sound system seems to be lower quality than my previous 2010 Nissan Murano. Also, I don't particularly like the lower profile because I like to ride higher. The 2010 Nissan Murano allowed for a higher ride. I presume the new design was lowered for safety and aerodynamic reasons."
The cozy cockpit feel of the interior. Also wonderful technology that is very easy to use!
1. Offer rain sensitive wipers  2. Have rear tailgate window open independently from hatch like on the Toyota Highlander.  3. Offer rear door window screens like on the Toyota Highlander.  4. Increase towing capacity.
"1. Syling,   2. Ride,  3. Front driver seat comfort,  4. Acceleration and engine capability."
Seats could be made better on the bottom where the company tools are the move seat position also had a 2006 altima that speakers sounded better in
Mostly everything
I especially like the 360 camera and the ability to back up while seeing all around the vehicle.
"Vehicle, sside from the transmission mishap has been great.     Service experience at Mac Haik was unforgettably bad.  Stranded on the roadaide and got NO help. I had my insurance Co. Tow the car to Autonation of Lewisville, they were great."
Smooth comfortable ride. Sharp looks. Cameras are amazing.
More options for the price
"The comfort with the ride, interior design."
compact yet sturdy
"More cubby hole space in front driver area. Electric seats to operate faster. Better tilt steering column. Motion sensor to operate back lift gate. The button is nice, but when hands are full it would be nice to have a foot motion sensor to open gate. Other vehicles have this and in my opinion the sensor is more useful."
"Overall design, roomy interior, warranty and the nissan name."
In my Murano the rear blind spots are immense and so alarming I will alert Consumer Reports to this obvious safety problem. Rattle from sunroof is also quite a constant irritant and undermines my confidence in your assembly and QC processes
Ride and sound system which is always turned up to cover the constantly rattling sunroof.
See previous comments.
The look of it. The seats are amazing. It's a beautiful car. I love the way it drives. Those are the reasons why I initially purchased the car even though I didn't love the warranty options Nissan provides.
Issues with bluetooth. Bluetooth in the car does not always work. Have to turn off car and back on again. Pandora app does not work in the car.
"Mid-size suv, V6 engine, no 3rd row seat."
"I can't think of anything, I enjoy everything about it, I think it's a beautiful vehicle"
"I love the body style, I think it's beautiful"
"I wish it had beeping or sound activated sensors as you pull close to something. It does have the cross traffic alert. Maybe it's just because my old vehicle had that and I was used to it. I'm also missing my oil change monitor, that was a percentage needed until next oil change. Overall, I love my Murano!"
"Technology, stylish exterior and beautiful, sleek interior. Great gas mileage too from my Yukon!"
Nothing
"Good looking, easy to use, comfortable"
"better color for interior, black shows all the dirt and fingerprints on dash and doors, maybe textured panels and dash in  a shade of brown or grey would do better.  Better gas mileage for this 6 cylinder would be nice."
"Nice ride, looks sporty.  love the pacific sunset color, have had beau-coup compliments on the color."
"the shape of the hood makes it very hard to park squarely in a parking stall, I put this down to the flared shape of the hood making it slightly harder to view parking stall"
powerful engine and smooth transmission gear changes
"It was a demo(6,200 miles) when we bought it and the radio has some scratches on it which we did not notice until about a month later and I never heard back from the dealer. Now I need to get the front driver door panel fixed because it makes too much noise."
"The drive, the ride... love it"
Improvements have been made in defrost from our 2013 nissan and this 2016 is much better bit not perfect.
The power is much better than our 2013 Rogue.
"a ""tray"" area into the front would be nice for sunglasses, iPhone, etc"
"ride, roominess, look and feel"
No problems and I can't find anything to improve on.
"The look of my vehicle, the smooth ride, and the comfort of the inside."
"So far, so good.  Wish the passenger front seat height could be adjusted."
"Styling, comfort and drivability."
Car play feature. Tri-zone vents to control air in back seats. More storage areas in trunk.
Exterior and interior style.
put a lumbor support on both front seats. better gas mileage.
"I really cannot pick one item, because easy to handle, safety features, computer friendliness."
"Beautiful, very stylish, both interior and exterior. Pricey, but in comparison to other vehicles in it's class, probably justified.  Perhaps adding a small piece of suitable material on the lower front of door panel to deflect scuffing would be welcomed."
"The beautiful, stylish, and well designed interior, and exterior."
"I think the carpet could be a far better quality, for the price of the veichle."
"It' s totally an awesome  car, I Love it ?"
I LOVE MY VECHICLE.
I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT IS ROOMY AND SPACIOUS.
I think all of the connect should work as it does on the 2017 and also the rear windshield shout have had a washer on as well other than that I love my 2016 murano
I love the long how it drives and the speakers
"Like the cars look over all, but the back tail lights are to over sized for the car."
like the navigation system.
"Even though there are a couple of minor annoyances, I truly love the car.  Would like a little better fuel economy and maybe a larger gas tank so I don't have to fill up as often."
The engine/transmission.  Great power.  Very smooth. I think it is a sharp looking car as well.  Different than all the other SUVs out there.
I love this car. If you did anything it would be to improve the quality of the carpet.
"Zoom, Zoom. It performs and well maybe that is why my mileage suffers but at at the age of 54 I don't care. I'll buy gas."
Quieter cabin. Option to just open the sunshade instead of the whole roof with one touch.
Options included.
"The storage within the vehicle is lacking. To many small nooks and not enough large places for storage. The glove compartment is very roomy, but far away from the driver's seat and you have to sit in the passenger seat in order to get anything out properly.The console storage is deep...perhaps too deep. It needs to be broken up in levels. The rear storage space is very small and not what I was used to  (I traded in a Toyota 4Runner). The USB Audio port is a really nice feature, however, it's placement could have been better thought out. Sometimes I have to stand outside the vehicle just to input a thumb drive."
The ride is really comfortable and the cabin is quiet.
I love my new vehicle so far...
"I have had my Murano since Nov. 2016, so that's much time. So far I love my Murano. The exterior I love and the interior also. The seats are so comfortable."
The comfort of the seats.
Cup holder in the doors are not comfortable.USB port in the front is very challenging to use.
Interior space is good. Exterior look is stylish
Controls for garage could be in better location and also controls on steering wheel could be a little easier to find and use.  Overall I love this car!
Luxurious and a really nice comfortable car. The lines of the car are also nice.  A nice looking car!
I am pleased with my vehicle.
"I like the color, Pacific Sunset."
"There would not have been a ding on my car, which I did not notice until after the first week, although my husband noticed it immediately and never said anything to me about it. I did not follow up because I thought it was too late. I also would like to be able to adjust my driver's side seat."
"This is the second Murano I have had and what I like most about my vehicle is that I absolutely know that for the most part I am in a vehicle, that even in the worst conditions, is a safe vehicle for me and my family"
"There are two things that need attention:  1) blindspots, though we have the light and sound alert for vehicles next the Murano, I would suggest that you add a ""fish eye"" to the lower outside corner of the exterior mirrors, this would give the driver just a bit more assurance.  2) glare off the hood, the hood nears the windshield has a downturned area which at times when the sun's reflection blinds the driver and passenger.  Would suggest either keeping the hood line straight back to windshield area or the use of some non-glare material on the downturned area that would resist reflection.    My dissappointment is not with the vehicle but with Nissan Finance.  Even with the selected option of notification for payments which worked, in fact still is active (received payment alert) even though I have paid the off the loan.  I could no longer access the history or the loan information after sending the pay off payment (had not received any information of receipt of payment).  Nor did I get any notice by email or mail that the loan had been paid until I recieved the title reflecting the lien had been ""canceled"".  I called the Nissan Finance phone number and seemed that I was dealing with a person that did not understand my need for receiving timely communication nor open to receive any suggestions on dealing with customers.  Hope that you can communicate these concerns to those in the Nissan Fiance area."
"We are still looking forward to taking a long trip in the vehicle to really appreciate the features of the vehicle.  Up to now with just local travel, it has proven to be a delight to drive.  Perhaps another survey at the 6 month or 12 month period will give us enough drive experience to best know how to respond."
"Put the seat set buttons up higher,  not near the door. Keep hitting it with my knee"
"The look, handling, power."
There is nothing that I would change or improve at this time.
The smooth drive and excellent turning radius.
The chip and scuff corrected before delivery. The stalling of the engine when starting during the cold. Easier steering. The popping when backing up and easier shifting. Explanation of cut in carpet.
"Appearance, comfort, ride"
N/A
Better milage.
"It's roomier, excellerates faster."
"Great looking SUV inside and out with many cool features. Blind spot monitoring feature is most helpful, although I prefer the warning light to be in the mirror and not on the side inside the vehicle. Lane guidance and warning feature is not available for some reason, even though I have the full Nissan Safety and Tech package. Steering is unresponsive and extremely light, unlike other Nissan and Infiniti SUVs which I have owned previously. If I had noticed this issue more during my test drive, I probably would not have purchased the vehicle."
"Seats, interior and exterior style, paint quality, visibilty, acceleration, and the overall quality of the fit and finish."
"For the platinum , I would have thought it would have  the step up rails on each side!"
Like very nice
"When I purchased the car, the car was clean...but not detailed.  This would've made my purchase much better."
"The looks, the fuel economy, the blend of economy and luxury."
Really nothing other maybe a little better fuel economy.
Driving this vehicle is awesome!
"Last car was a Nissan Altima.  Transmission was fluid and storage was wonderful.  The transmission, while the same, does not seem to work as well but it is still new with only 1400 miles.  Storage is overall poor.  Other than cup holders and the wonderful glove box on the console with tray, where do you drop keys for quick retrieval, i.e. fob to underground garage let's say or house keys.  Not friendly."
"Roomy and comfortable.  Easy to get in and out of.  Sits higher on the road.  Headlights  and the lane warning lights, cameras, blue tooth and navigation system are great.   Bought it to take trips in and will enjoy doing that."
The back windows need to go all the way down. Fix the phone connectivity and make the navigation system work when the radio is down.
Comforta
How smooth it rides.
I purchased a white car paid extra for the special paint...the color match between the exterior plastic parts (bumpers) and the rest of the car is obviously off....I would have thought that this problem would have been solved a long time ago.So far I'm very happy with the rest of the car
body styling..ride comfort
Seat heater on low too warm could use one more setting.  Back windshield washer you have to wash window with liquid each time. Needs separate sqirt control. Cost too much for sirius should not be tided into navigation.  With sirius once they have your credit card they charge you without your permission. Then it is up to you to try and get it off.  I should beable to add service not them.
Seats are great 10 way.  Which driver is driving control.  Very comfortable to drive.  Voice activated controls.  Driver dash is great being able to change and navigation automatically jumps to it keep eyes on road.  Dimable rear view mirror nice touch.  Ive had Nissans since 1998. Last year bought NV customized into conversion van.  We are stopped all the time for people to look at it.  Need 4wd for it would be awesome.
The power and looks of the Murano
I totally enjoy driving this vehicle. I appreciate the many safety features.
I like the comfort of the vehicle and appreciate the light indicator when vehicles are in the blind spot on either side as they approach.
"In Minnesota, remote start running for only 10 minutes is not very good. On my last Murano, had aftermarket remote installed it ran for 20 minutes before stopping. When it is 23 Below zero, 10 minutes doesn't get the the temp gauge off of Cold."
"Like everything I have experienced with the vehicle at this time,  of course it has only been two months since I've picked it up from the dealership."
If it had a sunroof
I like everything about my murano.
Thje interior noise is a little higher than I would like. this is my second Murano and I felt the same about my first Murano.    Two of my suggestions would be to have the exterior mirros retract automatically rather than manual. Install a compas on the rear view mirror/
Good looking vehicle and I like Nissans. Handles well and exceptional braking.
The driver's headrest is too close to my head. I wish I could tilt it back so that my head doesn't always touch it.
Very fun to drive!
"The 2012 Murano felt like more car,liked it much better. However, the 2016 gets better mpg on highway."
Color but wanted true red.
"Like the comfort and easy handling of the car. But the center console is a bit unhandy and no place for a women's purse, women always has a purse and where are we suppose to keep them?"
"looks handling, ease of driving right a way, Easy to learn settings."
I'd like the heater to be more powerful.
The handling is excellent to me.  I feel very safe in this car.
Don't like back-up camera..wish I could turn off. Phone doesn't always connect. I will be asking dealer for help with these when I re-visit.
"It's beautiful, luxurious, quiet & has incredible pickup...almost too much. I have to watch it as it takes off so quickly.."
Better gas mileage but understand it being lower than other cars out there
look and feel of the car
Better gas mileage is always a plus.
"Sporty drive, good technology."
can't think of anything.....I love my Murano!
I like everything about it
"Additional safety features need to be incorporated in every model year.  Lane departure warning would be a good addition.  Camera lenses get dirty and are not useful in bad weather, though I have no idea how that could be corrected, I suspect that is a problem with every vehicle by all manufacturers."
"Aside for the beautiful interior, which was a huge selling point, I like the hood/cowl design, which at highway speeds prevents snow from reaching and accumulating on the windshield.  I think that is a very under reported by MAJOR safety feature that few in any are aware of.  For us New Englander's something like that is a huge issue.  My forester would build up snow at highway speeds, this Murano never lets the snow hit the windshield, and that is fantastic."
The vision driving this vehicle is odd. I find myself taking wide tns or driving over curbs and have the most difficult time of my life parking. I can never tell where the wheels actually are. It is a very strangle feeling. I thought I would get used to it but I haven't. I feel like I can't drive any more. I'm almost 43 and this is a first for me.
Comfort. Seems to be reliable. I had a horrible experience with the dealership though. I had a big problem with the sales guy and the sales manager laughed at me
HIGHER UP FROM THE GROUND
The quiet and comfort of the ride.
"Interior of car is exceptional.  There are just minor tweaks. Seat belt buckle is a little hard to get on and off.  Noise as seat strap hits side of door. Otherwise exceptional interior, gages, heat and air."
"the car rides beautiful, the brakes are fantastic.  And the car sticks to the road under snow, ice, mud and beautiful days.  smooth ride,"
Exterior appearance
The cabin filter is terrible and the car could've been more appealing with the plastic glue popping up.
The engine power and comfortable ride.
"comfort,apperance,quality"
Steering seems to be a bit loose so it doesn't feel tight in curves.  Cup holders need to be able to hold mugs with handles.  A hair more room between the seat and center console.
"Overall feel, overall handling, interior technology."
"Comfort, color, ease of steering, remote car starter"
"I fell in love with the car, HAD to have it but needing a new transmission at less than 500 miles, pretty much killed my ""new car buzz"". I keep wondering what else will go wrong. Dealing with Consumer Affairs was, overall, a horrible experience. Since Nissan has already done what they will on this issue, I would suggest that the plastic? metal looking trim on steering wheel have softer edges."
"The look of exterior, especially in Pacific Sunset. It's not shaped like all the other SUVs."
I love driving my new car!
The windshield also had to be replaced because there were defects on it. The vehicle should have been fixed before it was presented to me at purchase. It was a mess when I picked it up
The vehicle is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever driven. The ride is very smooth
"It's my second Murano in 2 years .  I am impressed, but I don't know what my problem is about the brake pedal."
The style/design and the overall fuel economy.  It's roomy and very comfortable.  The NASA seating is great.
safety features
Love the vehicle. Would upgrade on the heated seats and mirrors next time.
"The ride and the space. Lots of room and very comfortable, even for back seat riders"
There in a hole in the driver side door that needs repair and would like window noise corrected
Rides very nice
Better customer service people (your consultant Chris Bors was very negative and rude to me on two occasions.) I asked for your Service Manager after the second incident who was a delight and represents your Service Department in a very positive and helpful manner.
smooth ride and appearance
I'm still fairly new to this vehicle and I would need another survey in about two months time to fully evaluate this vehicle.
inspect car better before selling and put a cover on the driver side seat belt at the floor level
looks and operation
Seat quality and seat support definitely needs improvement.  Gas mileage is much lower that what I expected.
Nice ride quality.
"Because this is the top of the line for this vehicle it should have automatic folding side mirrors and nissan should have an app that allows you to start, unlock, lock as well as other features that many other vehicles in this class has."
I don't have a favorite because there's a lot of features that a really love. I am really enjoying my vehicle.
I like everything! Love the Murano
I would move the gas cover release lever. It is too close to the hood release. In the dark and with the reach the hood latch release can be pulled by mistake. This could lead to a poped hood that might not be noticed and lead to an accident while traveling if it pops up.
I like the comfort
Nothing. I love my car!
It drives very nicely. Has no trouble going up hills and maintains the speed going down hills.
Technology features hard to set up....complicated.
Beautiful & confortable
nothing
it si comfortable
"Appreciate all the available instrument features, just taking time to get used to everything available."
"Size, engine, comfort, quietness"
Update the navigation system information. I am otherwise satisfied with the vehicle.
"Looks good, very comfortable seats, good ride, plenty of room."
The detail could have been more thorough as there was small pieces of plastic stuck in many joints.
I like the roominess and the styling.
Nothing - i am satisfied.
Love the interior
When the sun is overhead there is reflection off of the hood into the driver's eyes at certain angles or during certain directions of travel.
The ride is quiet and smooth.
I feel that this vehicle should have the back up notice on it not just the camera and the power lift gate on all models and the heated door mirrors for cold mornings and dew.
I love my car I have good space for traveling and carting my grandkids around.  Great move from a chevy surburban to my murano. (smiles)
Have a mayor problem with brake assist and brake warning....not working.    Sales dosent know what to do.. Service tell me not avsileble on murano and factory tell me that it works like the air bags syst..... Really i have to hit another car before it assist....murano 2016 platinium teck packg. With 997 miles...   Very very disapointed... Please help... I dont know what to do except look into an atorney.... Diego Castro
Looks and drive and fuel economy
Nissan Connect needs to be improved
Looks and smoothness
"I think the car is great. I am just not very happy with the seat adjustments. I am also having an issue with the volume, when I am talking on my cell phone. It gets louder and then so soft I often have trouble hearing the caller."
The way it looks.
I'm very disappointed with the Bluetooth system doesn't work
The rooftop to open all way to the back seat
Very comfy and super smooth  and easy to drive
"I would like to see more towing capacity. Maybe 3,000 pounds, which is more than reasonable for the engine, may have to change CVT."
The exterior styling
Nissan connect on internet could be tweaked to be more user friendly.
Attractiveness.
Navigation map says it is 2014-2015. I think it should be more up to date. I told the dealer and he ordered me the most up to date SD card. I put it in and the map version was the same. With the second card I could not get XM radio so I put the original SD card back in.
Price
"The brake pedal is located too far to the right and very near the gas pedal. This leaves not enough room for your foot to hit the gas pedal and not be engaging the brake. Very poor design. I have never owned a car with this poor of location of the brake pedal. This needs to be changed and moved 3-4"" to the left."
"Very comfortable seats, ride is quiet. Good visibility. Interior is of high quality"
"Better visibility, for the driver, front sides, and while turning head to check blind spots."
Price
"There are some blind spots that need to be thought thru as well.  Also, I was not happy with my dealership and will definitely NOT be going back to that one if I decide to get another Nissan.  Overall, I like my new car, I just don't know if I would buy it again after everything that has happened."
I like the way it handles and the way it drives the most.  I can see where I am going easily because of the way it sits up off the road unlike the car I had before.
It rides smooth and handles well.
I love it!!
The way it drives and the syle
Roomy rides and drives great
So far so good
Safety featured
I love my new car-I do feel there need to be a place to put a cell phone and a womens purse-but all in all I love it
The look-I love the look and the inside is awesome-love my brown leather interior
City gas mileage could be better.
The technology package
I love how some new cars now show the speed in the front windshield as well as on the dash.  I think this would be awesome.  Not enough space to put phone or anything else in the front.
"Looks nice, drives well."
The cameras and safety features are the only way I could drive the car.  I am not accustomed to having such a small rear window so the blind spot is terrible.  With the safety features I manage fine.
"After owning Honda Pilots for years, it is nice to have a smooth ride.  I don't feel like I'm in a truck anymore."
Passenger seat too low for smaller passenger
Pretty much everything at this time
"Front grill could be shaped a little different, but overall its okay."
The shape and interior with the Pearl finish.
Fix road & air noise too my satisfaction.
"The rear view mirrors need to be operable when the vehicle is in reverse, rather than pointing at the ground."
"Very nice vehicle - comfy, nice looking, good ride."
"love my car...nothing you can do...for the next version...need more space for stuff.  phone, coin, chapstick...the little dish you provide is too small and it is shared with the USB and aux plug."
the interior is pretty darn sexy. The seats are comfortable and the large sunroof is a bonus.
I LOVE this car!
Easy to drive. I feel very safe in it. I love the technology of the dashboard.
need to pick up cargo net and cover to navigation memory card.
"safety features, styling"
Don't overlook basic pre factory testing (our tires lugs not tested for tightness) that puts the drivers at risk of accident or death.
price and size
"It is nice that it came with remote starter, but it is limited range and did not work with the phone, which is common in 2016 models of your competitors for cars in this price range.  It should have more power outlets/usb ports in the rear section."
"The seats are great.  I like the intelligent cruise control, since I do a lot of highway driving.  The various blindspot detectors are also very nice."
Better stability. BETTER MPG!
I love it.
I wish heated steering wheel came with the SL model like it did in my 2014 Altima SL and other than the ocassional squeak I am very pleased.
Having an SUV again
Comfortable seats for long trips. Ease in handling while driving.
better gas mileage and more cup holders in rear
comfort and looks
Everything
The design.
"I really LOVE my Murano!!!  I owned an 03 Altima for 14 years prior to this and kept it cuz I still love it too.  As expected, the mileage on the Murano is not as great as the Altima, but not reaching sticker predictions either, so a little disappointed in that.  The technology is exceptional-still hoping I get it all figured out-LOL! This vehicle drives and rides like a dream-Love it!!"
Oops-pretty much answered that on the last one...
Really have no complaints...am enjoying  drivng this car
Very comfortable ride..
better integration with Andriod operating systems and apps;   the USB jack between the front seats is difficult to access;
"interior finishing, engine performance, ride comfort, suspension, interior seating space"
A little more quietness and less bumpiness while driving
The interior and the sound system. I also really love the all around camera and the intelligent cruise control.
"I would like the foot activated tailgate lift. A friend purchased a Ford Edge. I strongly believe the Murano styling is much better, the Ford seems to have better or more advanced electronic features."
"I like the styling. I think the Murano is the best looking Crossover on the road. For the overall size of the Murano, there seems to be an abundance of interior room."
"Getting my dents and scratches fixed would really help.  Other than that, I don't have any real complaints.  It's a great car!!"
Handling and feel of the road.  That might be a tied with the interior though.  It is very classy and I love it!!
I would like the paint to match and the brakes tightened.  I'm not sure about the noise because I do not want a fix to result in the roof leaking.
I like the way it drives but my car is smaller than the car I test drove.  That was weird but I like the car.  I do wish it was a tiny bit larger.  It seems kind of a tight fit.
"Beautiful interior, easy to operate, like the colors.  Got a baser model due to price and I am really pleased.  Would have been in heaven if I could have afforded the top of the line.  Operation is Very smooth!  Quiet, well made."
Improve site lines and length of vechicle
Comfortable quiet ride
"The front is to high. Even at the highest seat level, I can not see in front of the car. Nose should slope down. I often hit curbs due to poor visibility.    Otherwise, I love my car."
Looks and ride! technology! Cameras!
My suv doesn't have a auto lift gate I wish now  I had a car that dose .This is such a nice suv it's a shame it doesn't have the auto gate.
"My first car was a Datsun 280 zx and after buying Fords ,Toyotas , more than one each I thought I would give Nissan a try again may be my last one or not but here we are. I like it but it don't have the auto gate, my only regret."
The vehicle was is perfect condition
"Stiffness control for the suspension (usually 3 point settings these days),  More electronic driving aids - lane departure, dynamic cruise control, emergency stopping."
"Roomy, VERY comfortable, very quite inside, excellent ride over bad roads, great sound system, incredible interior design and colors, surprisingly good mileage, great engine/transmission response, beautiful overall design."
Everything
"The heater or air conditioner or defogger should start when you remote start the vehicle. The location of the USB port and auxiliary cord on the center console make it difficult to keep a clean looking interior with cords hanging out if you need to use the USB .  The center storage compartment should have two openings with a shallow level in a deep level not just one big compartment, the little shelf that sits inside is almost useless because you have to move it to reach anything on the bottom. There should be a two door opening so you can push one button to open the top console click two buttons to open the deep console. There are no small hidden compartments or pockets easily accessible to the driver if you wanted to for example have some cash in the car is no way to hide it anywhere"
I love the look of the interior with the pearl however I found that it scratches easily.  The vehicle handles very well. Honestly one of the number one reasons we purchased a Nissan was because it does not have a seatbelt reminder alarm that goes off constantly.
The hood was designed in a way that causes extreme glare when the Sun it's a from a certain direction. This can be extremely dangerous but fortunately I was able to take care of the problem with minimal cost and inconvenience
The quiet and comfortable ride and the fuel mileage. Also it seems to be very reliable
We are overall pleased with the vehicle and the dealership. The minor problems we have don't outweigh how pleased with are with Nissan.
"The appearance, comfort, technology, and driving experience. We love that it is all wheel drive, also."
"Seat belts are hard to grab and somewhat difficult to fasten.  Very limited storage space, none for a small box of Kleenex.  Difficult to get into center storage...seems to be a bit too far into the back of the vehicle. Roll up rear storage cover should be included with vehicle, not a hundred plus dollar option.  Easier access to oil filter and oil filter change plug should be addressed. Driver AND passenger seat should have up and down adjustment feature.  Steering wheel should be adjustable for up and down,  not just the steering column.  Front seat slide adjusters should be a bit higher for easier reach on non power seat models."
"Over all quality of automobile and assembly is exceptional.  Ranks as one of the two best vehicles I have ever owned.  Fit, finish, and standard equipment offered are all outstanding.  The exterior styling  makes all other SUV's take a back seat.  Congratulations to your design team!"

the ride
"Better gas mileage.  Since I am quite short, I would like to be able to raise the driver's seat to a bit higher level in order to see comfortably over the dash and hood."
"The front, side and rear cameras; the user friendly dashboard electronics; also the car's agility and responsiveness in city driving"
Better sound system
Driveability
handles well
The front seats have a sharp corner on the plastic housing beneath the seat cushion. I have scraped my leg on this several times.   There is way too much chrome on this car; I also think the interior paneling (marbelized plastic) is a bit cheesy.
"I have had three Muranos, including this one, and I love the steering and the ride. It's why I keep buying them, even though the new styling isn't to my liking."
Seems like the heater takes a really long time to heat up and the a/c after the heat has been on still blows hot air for awhile. Also I don't like how after driving and you pull up and put vehicle in park but keep the motor running how all doors stay locked and you have to push the unlock button to let anyone out or for the driver to get out
"The look of the exterior and interior, it's very roomy, and drives very smooth"
"Nothing, I love it"
The body design in the interior
The fuel economy could be better.
"While the charging port on the center console is a great location, it's an inconvenience to always have to have it open in order to connect my phone.  Since my phone charges on the bottom it doesn't ""sit"" in the space, and it does not fit sideways to close the compartment."
The looks
Nothing.
Everything!
Overall this is a great car.  Storage capacity is extremely limited.  Make it more attractive to a buyer by adding a luggage rack as a standard feature.  The Nissan apps is terrible.  Very hard to get set up and time intensive.
The outside design is very sleek and attractive.  Handles well.  Interior seating is very comfortable.
Power and stability. Drove like a champ in the snow!
Heated seats steering wheel.  Automatic hatch. Comfort.

"Placement of seat belt anchor could be improved so you don't have to reach back so far to pull belt forward.  Power steering is a little too responsive, leading to some oversteer, particularly when turning around tight corners.  Other than that, the car is terrific.  I drove my last Murano for ten years without a single problem of any kind.  Hoping for same experience with my new one."
"The comfort, the safety options, the solid ride, the responsiveness, the sound system, the appearance."
Better gas mileage. Heated steering wheel. Air cooled seats.
Attractive SUV. Great drive. Love active cruise control and 360 cameras.
Tires: Use all weather tires. Longer wearing and better traction.
I really like the way it handles.

"The backseat leg room is extremely roomy.  The trunk space is not however. Also, when I open the trunk it automatically locks the doors so i have to lock and unlock the doors to get in the car.  Annoying."

"Vaden Nissan of Hilton Head was a disappointing purchasing experience to say the least.  I have never been treated so poorly (especially when purchasing a big ticket product)!  The only person that was professional was our sales person, Melissa Gardner.  She went above and beyond to help us with very minimal support from the Vaden staff.  As for the finance, insurance, sales management departments, etc, I cannot give a good review.  The General Sales Manager, John, left an open-ended conversation by not returning a call. He was looking to help minimize some of the costs ... Like they sold me a package (wheel locks, floor matts, an emergency kit, tinted windows) for just under $2000 that I did not want.  I asked that it all be removed except for the tinting (which would have been hard for them to do and of which I would have paid for) to no avail. If I was going to spend more money, I would have purchased an extended warranty!  I was trying to keep my payment down. I didn't need those extras or even want them.  All of the problems that we had with them are too numerous to put in this review.  I do know, however, that I will not be recommending anyone to Vaden Nissan. I am so disappointed with them.  The purchasing experience could have been much better.  I have owned a Pathfinder and Xterra.  I LOVE Nissan products and ultimately, my Murano!!  That is the only reason along with dealership and Nissan incentives that I went to Vaden."

"Solve the EXHAUST PROBLEM. IT DRIVES MY WIFE NUTS. WE SPENT $37,000 to buy a new NISSAN, YHIS IS OUR 2 nd NISSAN. THE WHOLE EXHAUST SYSTEM IS COORODED IN LESS THAN 2 months. Hopefully, on MONDAY CROWN NISSAN FIXES IT. VERY BAD IMPRESSION ON NISSAN BRAND TO FIND CORRODED EXHAUST SYSTEM."
Feels good to drive and comfortable.
"Nothing I can think of, I love the car."
Safety features
The vehicle is pretty much what I thought it would be
Set rear view mirror to memory function
Very comfortable ride..  love the seats
I miss my old trunk but that's something I'll get used to -
all of it!
It is a sporty and luxurious looking vehicle.
"Better updates on the navigation system would be nice, along with better voice recognition. When we take our suv in to be serviced, I will have them look at the seat. The rest are design issues and I will have to live with them.  Our next new vehicle we will look for these item improvements."
I love the lighter interior that we have. It was one of the main reasons we picked the Murano. I like the big navigation screen. I also like how comfortable the seats are.
"The wind noise is better than our 2013 Murano, but still more than I would like."
Birds eye view feature
"Fix the entertainment system, the non-intuitive controls, and make the seating surfaces more resilient (so they don't stain)."
"Most of it.  It drives/handles well, it's roomy, and it looks good."
"The murano overall I would rate a 9 out of 10. If the ride of the murano was just a little more smoother, I would've rated it a 10."
What I like most about my murano is the fact that i can go from a larger family sized suv to a smaller suv ( kids grown and gone and didn't want a small vehicle) with the style and look of luxury that you would have in a luxurious sedan. The interior of this vehicle is beautifully designed and the size is a perfect fit for the transformation i made. Great job nissan!!
N/a
Very smooth ride. Great on fuel and easy handling.
Very comfortable and a lot of options
Style I really like the vehicle
I would prefer that the garage door opens not be on the mirror (it's to easy to move the mirrors when you open and close the doors)    I would like to see more storage room in the front seat.  A place to put paper and pen and chap stick and kleenex
The way it handles
"The front design with the bumps on the hood makes it difficult to see over and around the hood or to see how close your are getting to things. The positioning of the windows seems high when you drive up to a bank teller or restaurant take out window and I have my seat as high as it goes. I'm about 5'2"" so I'm not exceptionally short."
The luxurious interior and the smooth and quiet ride.
The addition of rain sensitive wipers and passenger side auto dimming mirror.
Styling and comfort of seats.
fuel efficiency. Take a lot of gas especially for inner cities.
driving is smooth . looks interior/ exterior. camera
"the direction the vehicle is driving in is hard to see and would be better if it was just the direction. i.e. N, S, W, E instead of the wide area of directions. it needs to be brighter or colored to be more noticeable."
comfort of driving. everything is easily accessible .
It would be nice if intelligent cruise control could be deactivated
"Ride, handling and looks"
1)Center console is smaller than I would have liked.  2)The USB port is POORLY located in the smaller compartment.  3)The sun glares on the navigation/audio screen making it difficult to see on a sunny day.  Perhaps make the screen a matte finish or try an inlay design like the 2017 Pathfinder has.
"The overall external look of the vehicle, the large hatch space, the feature that allows the back seats to automatically lay down & come back up, seats are good quality material, white stitching and are very comfortable. It hugs me when I get in;) I also like ALL the safety features, beeps, flashing lights, etc.  The steering wheel is nice and thick; the controls are conveniently located and the right size."
TAKE IT BACK
"Safety features, comfort of seats, heated seats and steering wheel"

Not overly impressed with Bose speakers.  Wish Nissan went with better brand.
"Engine, drivetrain and appearance.  Safety features are good."
Nissan Connect could be improved - bluetooth connectivity with navigation  Inside lever to open back door  Fix phone connectivity issue  Overall - a great vehicle - fun to drive
"Looks, driving, interior layout, gas mileage."
Go back to the old style Pathfinder
Nothing in particular
Squealing noise must be fixed or I cannot keep this brand new vehicle

Beautiful vehicle
the seat belt is uncomfortable and hurts my leg where the latch is - it is very close and rubs on my leg.  It is better if I place the seat belt backwards.

"It was difficult, during a recent snow storm, to keep ice off the passenger side window. Not sure if this model comes with heated windshield wipers, but that would have been  wonderful."
The drive is so comfortable and quiet. The car handles beautifully.
I have not achieved EPA fuel estimates as Nissan promoted.
nothing at this point...this is my third nissan murano
The exterior sportiness look
No  suggestions at this time
Love everything
Steering wheel not so heavy and stiff.  The heated seats need to work a lot better. Compared to other cars I have driven with heated seats my Nissan has been the worse.  The steering wheel heat is terrible.  Works maybe 5 to 10 minutes.  I have a murano platinum I expected the heated seats to work much better.  I hope when the summer comes the cooling seats work along with the AC.
The look of it. It's a beautiful car. I just expected for such an expensive car things would work better.
"better gas millage, our 04 Murano got close to 30mpg on trips, new one gets about 22mpg  drivers read door handle is peeling from the plastic covering put on in factory (getting fixed 1/31/17 where we bought it."
"comfort, handling and quietness."
Easily to get in and out of.  Very comfortable.
"Nissan needs to correct the problem of the interior noise on my Murano, it is unacceptable. The salesman and the Service Staff acknowledged the problem and also stated that Nissan should take corrective action."
The interior roominess and the exterior look.
Nothing
Better sales manager. Extremely rude and unhelpful.
I think what could be done to improve the vehicle are optional features such as power seats that I chose not to include on my mofel
I like the way it looks and is very sleek and stylish and appreciate the increased room from my previous vehicle
I am very happy with my new Murano.
"The keyless start, the dead space side camera, the fact that I sit up higher and have better vision of the road."
The style of the car looks good
looks ride and power
Would prefer a bit smaller overall sized vehicle with continued six cylinder and other amenities.
So far car is performing as it should
Sunglasses storage is useless.  Water rolls off the roof into the car when opening door or window.  I had a horrible experience when purchasing this vehicle.
Cameras and safety alerts
Fabric on seats shows everything
The looks of it
smooth ride and refinement.
"Other than issues that we will have dealer look at....The biggest flaw that we've seen is the temp buttons for the seats.  In a bad space.  If something is cup holder, real hard to turn the nobs."
comfortable and quiet
Nothing to report love my murano ! Great experience even our salesman was great .
Quiet smooth ride and my grandson has leg room in the back .
Not as quiet after driVing for a couple of months.
All of it.
Adding the over the lane notification
Safety in the snow/ice
My only disappointment is with the gas. It does not seem to be good on gas.
I love everything about my vehicle except the low mileage on gas.
I'm happy with the the vehicle
It's new and I love Nissan

I don't have any suggestions at this time.

The only thing I would improve on is the headlights.  They are very dim for night driving.  I am hoping there is a way to improve the headlights on my car without having to trade up to the Nissan Murano Platinum model.
The exterior style and lines
I bought an SL package.   It should have come with steering wheel memory.

"I absolutely love my 2016 Murano. One thing I have noticed though is that the gas mileage does not really add up as you drive the car. Although the gas mileage shows about 425 mph after full tank I only get to drive ,367 mph before I have to refill.   Overall I am very safisfied with my Murano. Thank you for this great vehicle."
"Look, quality of. Mechanical design and pretty much everything. Iam a proud a Murano Owner."
"better quality control on paint, more durable plastic interior, wider hatch opening, better use of interior cargo space, additional ground clearance"
"quiet, smooth acceleration, appearance, seat comfort, braking, headlight highbeam brightness, easy interior controls"
"Well the only problem I have with this vehicle is all wheel drive but they do not have an anti-lock button to lock the four-wheel-drive in place just have a traction control so felt funny in the snow not like the Nissan rogue four-cylinder i had it came with  antilock  4 Wheel Dr., Lock button"
the volume control on the steering wheel is to small

Technology needs to be better. Integration with Apple Car or Android Auto is a must in today's cars. Navigation system is an improvement over previous years but is still very primitive from technology stand point and is cumbersome to use.

smooth quiet drive and nice interior
"I love the car, but there could be some improvements. The steering radius could be better. The radio quality and speakers are marginal, should be better. Cars these days should come with charge ports on the rear of the center console for passengers in the back seats. Overall, I love the car and the way it drives, the interior is simple, but elegant. I would prefer that it be more responsive without having to force it into acceleration in certain situations, but overall I am very pleased with the car."
"I love the look of the car, inside and out. It seems to be an exceptional value when you compare it to other SUV's on the market that are higher priced. I like the way it handles, it's a very comfortable ride, which I have great appreciation for."
"A lack of audio sensors while parking is a huge disappointment. The cameras are nice, but don't substitute audio sensors.  My last car was 10 years old and had this, I just assumed the Murano did too.  Disappointed."
"Interior, great moon-roof, bright, pep while driving - it's fun to drive."
I love the vehicle!  It is just an adjustment downsizing from an Armada!
"I love the handling, gas mileage, the sporty look and the interior.  I just miss the space and being up high in the armada"
"The infotainment system is not up to the high standards of the rest of the vehicle.  If you provided a radio, CD player and solid connection to Apple Car Play and Android Auto I would be thrilled!"
"Very roomy, nice ride, reliable, quiet."
"Ease of voice commands for navigation, phone calls and entertainment."
"Ride, seats, look, space. It's a beautiful car."
"The Ride and navigational system and blind spot  mirrors  Comfort of seats, ease of using the eletronics"
Needs to be more sound proof.
"Drives great, very pleasant ride.  Roomy & very comfortable."
Slightly better gas mileage. Stop mirrors from auto down facing. Default should be neutral. Love the vehicle otherwise.
Hmmm...The overall ride and liftgate. Appearance is a close 2nd.
just improve the bottle holders on the side doors. It doesn't hold the water bottle or drinks well
"nice instruments, spacious, nice exterior look, fun to drive"
The vehicle is wonderful.beautiful car.
Make the instructions on how to use the Hi-Tech information system more friendly for the folks who grew up before there were computers.    use good pictures on where the switches are located.  I find that some information is on other pages than what the book says they are.  I will ultimately need help in some of these areas.  I am a post graduate person and still have problems with the information that is available in the Owners Manuel.  However I will prevail.
It is absolutely great.  I have never owned a vehicle with so many computer/electronics.  The workmanship is superb.
"We have had 3 Nissans - 2 Murano & 1 Altima. Your product is outstanding  which is the only reason we still buy it. Although our dealership is not the subject  of this survey I will comment because it can sully the whole buying experience.  I have commented on this in a previous survey. The buying process has not   become more civil  - it remains a difficult and stressful process which it need not be. High pressure sales is said to have been modernized  - it is in fact the   same carnival it has always been. I have no idea who reads these surveys or   if anybody does, but if I were Nissan Motors maybe more attention should be given to the entire process. Your product is good enough to sell itself!"

Cup holders need to be able to be enlarged for larger cups. The  engine stalls occasionally when starting but there is no rhyme or reason and I can't reproduce to make it happen again.
"The luxury, heated/cooled seats, heated steering wheel."
Driver side head rest is in the one position. Have to put head to far back. Much better on my Maxima.
Look and sportiness
Not sure.  It is a fun vehicle to drive and attractive to look at.  I was expecting more in regards to craftsmanship than is there.  The fuel mileage is what it is but has not been close to the sticker.
"I like the sporty look.  The responsiveness of the engine.  The built in technology like navigation, rearview camera and Nissan Connect."

The new look of the Murano which are used to own the older body style I like the big navigation and screamed and all that on the car seats are very comfortable the big sunroof And the side beers with a warning in the system when you come up on a car when it beeps I think all this are great features
"If the two problems I've mentioned can be resolved, I will be very well pleased."

Nothing.  It is a great car.
The seats are very comfortable
Wish gas mileage was better
We truly like our vehicle
The seat belt anchor point on the floor behind the front seats tends to get pushed on by rear seat passengers which makes the seat belt tighten on the person in the front.  The sound system could use a little more bass and power.  Gas Milage could be a little better.  These are very minor though and the car is truly outstanding.
I love the seats and comfort. I also love the way it looks. I really like the motor it has plenty of power and it sounds great when you get heavy on the throttle.
"I am in winter months right now. My vehicle was washed but not polished when I received it. When I bought my GM vehicles, they are shining when I picked them up. Now my car doesn't look nice, even after washing it. This is a huge deal to me. I like to drive a sharp & sparkling clean vehicle. I don't get compliments on this vehicle like I did (all the time) with my GM & Audi vehicles. Shame on the dealership & salesman."
Its new & has very nice up-to-date technology. The Seats are wonderful & so comfy. It drives very nice.
1. Improve quality of the carpet-it was much better on my 2002 Maxima  2. Improve quality of plastic for eye glass holder-it was much better on my 2002 Maxima  3. Suspension  4. Rear Visibility
"Roomy interior  Exterior Style  Sound System  back light controls on the steering wheel  Compass and speed readings on the dashboard  Ability to open hatch from inside  Comfort of front seats  I live in Minnesota and the Murano handles snow very well, even wet, heavy snow.  Cameras-they really help with the poor rear visibility and when pulling into a parking space."
Wish the destinations were as clear as they should be  and that the satellite would pick up in all areas; and wish there wasn't some wind noise
"The styling is very nice, the paint job is great, the interior is nice and the seats are very comfortable.  The motor is very snappy and the radius for turning is nice.  The heated seats work fantastic!"

Include quality seat covers / particularly for cloth seats.
fuel economy is great / only owned for a couple months but feels solid and like an expensive quality vehicle.
I don't know of any improvements to be made

The ride has been excellent. We like both the exterior and interior look.

The ride
"positioning of side mirrors.  I found it hard to see the white line when making left turns, maybe because I'm 5'4""  don't know.  I find myself raising up to may sure I don't run over the meridian."
"I like the out side style, especially at night when I start it up.  It looks so rich.  The inside is so yummy, never would have thought mixing black and brown would make me do a double take.  Love the interior to death."
"Allow drivers seat to go back a little further than it does.  Improve Bose sound system for more and cleaner bass response.  Make junction of silver plastic on steering wheel to rest of steering wheel smoother, edge rough now."
Quietness and smoothness of the ride.  Comfort of seats/driving position.

"The shape of the front seat - when you sit straight or lean back a little, then your head would  comfortably touch the head rest."
Roominess; quiet and smooth ride; sleek exterior appearance.
More standard by safety features automatic braking excetera
"Throttle response is sometimes more than i ask for . The jury's still out on the new CVT . Minor improvements on the old one might have been a better idea.I had a 2013 murano . I had a 6 cd changer in my 13 ,now I have a 1 cd unit . I had 4 rear cargo lights ,now i have one.I would like to see a compass as standard equipment. This is my third Murano,and before that a Maxima. I have yet to see a car with a calendar in it ! Why not? Couldn't it be part of the clock ?"
Looks and performance .
More room for second row. Let them scoot back further. Give second row a console.
Bluetooth. Smooth ride. Rear view camera.
Apple I-pod interface is disappointing
Quiet ride and excelleration
Better placement of seat belts.
Smooth driving.
"After having driven this vehicle for three months, the only suggestion I could make would be to tweak the latch system on the hatch as it opens and closes. It could be a little quieter. One other comment, I would also like to see text messages be offered using the apple I phone."
I love the maneuverability of the Murano! It is very sporty yet it accommodates the purpose of an SUV!
"The car is great, but for me being on the little shorter side (5') is kind of hard to see corners when making turns.  It would have been greater if the seat went little higher.  Other than that, I love my new car :0)"
Everything from exterior color to way it drives
"Gas mileage is only at 18 mpg, that's city and highway driving.  I know it is still in the break-in phase, but am hoping for better.  The engine seems quite noisy when accelerating."
"Easy to drive, will go up my driveway when it is slick, overall look and comfortable interior."
"Heated steering wheel function.  If it is on when u shut off the vehicle, it should be on when u restart the vehicle.  Its annoying to have to constantly turn on the heat.  Toggle on / off switch would be better."
"Smooth ride, great technology and sound system, full sun roof, looks bad ass."
I love this car and cannot think of anything that could make it better!
Seats are totally comfortable and is really nice to drive and handle.
It's a very smooth ride
"The only problems I have had to address that is not in your questionnaire is:  The driver and passenger windows needed tinting along with a visor on the windshield to reduce sun glare.  The hood where it slopes toward the windshield is a sun catcher.  It has almost blinded me when the sun hits it, so have had to drive with one hand up to block the sun.  I have had to spend some $$ to get these problems fixed, which is crazy with such an expensive car to begin with.  I wish I had noticed these items when I did the test drive, I would have notified the dealership."
I love the camera.  It's a comfortable ride with plenty of leg room.  It is nice looking.  This is the first Nissan I have ever purchased so I hope it lives up to the standards I have heard about.  I do wish that a lane departure alert was included in this vehicle.
Overall I like the vehicle a lot I wish they were more storage compartment on the driver side big enough for a cell phone and for a way to deactivate the beeping noise when you leave the headlights on. Also rain-sensing windshield wipers will be a nice addition
The exterior look but mostly it's very comfortable inside
Muy satisfecho
El espacio
I love the attractiveness. It's beautiful inside and out. A lot of attention to detail. I feel like I'm in a real luxury car.
accessory auto-timeout is WRONG.  I like to listen to radio while napping. Car battery will easily support ten hours of radio with no danger. Nissan cuts off my radio after a few minutes. I wish it was programmable.  NO NEED TO PROTECT BATTERY from an hour or two of simple radio use.
"zippy shiftpoints and acceleration  sporty handling  super braking, even in rain  stylish exterior"
The style and look of the overall vehicle.
My head lights only go about a car distance away making it hard to see ahead and only about 3' up on sides at night and when the road is not flat my headlights can disappear on the road with the slightess bump
How comfortable it is and how it handles to the road
Improve the infotainment system's integration with current smartphone technology.  The Nissan Connect app has horrible reviews--so bad that I choose not to use it at all.  This is something you can easily correct.
The design of both the exterior and interior are excellent.
Fixing the heating system.
Exterior color and roomy interior.
Nice ride great infomatics
I really do like this car.  I don't have much to say about improving it.  But if I did have to pick one or two things I would perhaps change the temperature controls as I discussed earlier and I believe there are blind spots in the back near the rear windows. So visibility to the far rear sides when you are turning your head.
I just like driving it.
rides more like a car than previous SUV's I have had
I love this car! The only issue is that I was shown a car with a roof rack but wasn't told that was an added item.
Heated steering wheel! Roominess. Technology!
Looks sharp.
All paint should match. No wind noise. No rattles.
"Style, features, tech package comfort."
"I like the nissan product of today,much improved from years ago when I owned them. They had lost enough quality to have me switch to other brands. At this early stage I am surprised at the perfection that you have achieved.   I am considering a cargo van now and possibly a 44diesel. It was complete happenchance that I bought this Murano."
"Quality,efficiency,safety,comfort"
Any chance of making the heated steering wheel have 'degrees'.. so that it can be hot or just warm.. sometimes it gets to hot.. such a ridiculous thing to even mention.
Everything.
I wish the gas mileage was better much better
its looks
"We are enjoying the Murano because of the interior room , but we are disapointed with the gas mileage. We had 2 Maximas prior to the Murano and we felt for a sports car it was good on gas."
"I like the ride , interior room and the safety features that the new Murano offers."
cabin noise I heard the wing when driving speeds over 40 mpr
The looks and safety
exterior design
Bluetooth connectivity should be fixed. Sometimes it can't connect to the phone
I like its look and smooth driving.
"I had a 2013 & I love all the changes that were made. Style, interior, gas open in car to name a few. Smoother ride & liked my other car but you guys made great improvements."
Love the remote start. Didn't have that before. New body shape & love that you now had a whiter white. You used to have not a white white & I really am glad you switched or added this color b/c had black before & always love white but didn't like your previous whites.
"If the text message reader didnt read every little bit of information... like the time, date and everything else for every text you receive... that would be nice."
The options and ease of use is incredible. Everything from the seat moving out of the way for you.. to the tilt of the side view mirrors while in reverse... the things I would have known to look for this suv has.
Safe comfortable ride
nothing
"rides nice, looks nice"
Most of the issues mentioned are intermittent and not likely to be obvious during a regular service visit. Although I will report them to service during my next visit. I
"Driver and passenger areas are spacious, stylish and comfortable. Exterior styling is sleek and attractive. It is very comfortable and easy to drive on a long trip. Sound system is adequate. The technology package is convenient and easy to use"
The look and feel. All the fancy extras.
Mileage is lower than I had expected.
I like the feel of driving and handling.  Good seat position.  Nice acceleration and steering and braking.  (It does feel a little TOO LIGHT on the road.)  Pleasant interior.  (Took just a little time to get used to the CVT.)
Make text messages compatible with iPhone via Bluetooth.
Comfort
fix phone issues....find way to solve chrome reflections in side mirrors
Improved fuel economy.  Drive about 120 miles a week usually I will have to fill up about Every 7-10 days
Love it I will be a Nissen customer  with my next car purchase in about 5 years because my grandson already has plans to take this vehicle to college.
Better gas mileage
Design and performance
There are not enough quick dial numbers.  There are only 5 and my 2010 Maxima had 10.  Not sure why I cannot get my text through this car either.
"Roominess, handling, interior"
"Nothing can be done on my year/model.  However, please consider what was described in this survey for future Murano lines."
"Appearance/design, handling, comfort & dashboard display."
Improve gas mileage; offer the blind spot signal like in the Rogue.
I like the way the Murano handles; the body style; and my sound system
"Fix the problem!!! This is clearly affecting the value of my vehicle. All my acquaintances are laughing at me for buying this noise maker. STAND BY YOUR PRODUCT!!! All you do is lip service but do not stand behind your product. If you are going to call me to discuss, then be sure to actually try to reach me rather than leave a VM and never responding to my call backs."
appearance
Improving any of the items I mentioned earlier.
I absolutely LOVE the comfort of the seating and temperature control seats in the front area. I also love the no-key ignition system. The comfortable seating was the main reason I bought the Murano over any other cross-over. The Rouge didn't even touch the same seating or I would have purchased that car.
LOVE EVERYTHING
Direction of travel display on the screen.
The overall handling of the vehicle. Smooth and will turn on a dime.
Everything!!!!!
My new Murano is an excellent car. I had an SUV before and it drove like a truck. The Murano drives like a luxury car. It's quiet and very comfortable.
The accessories and the ride.
Glove compartment is small
It is just a pleasure to drive it
"Good car, terrible terrible customer service."
interior and shape
Really can't think of anything.  We love it!
"Style, smooth driving, luxurious interior, sound system."
"The windshield wipers are a little noisy. Also, when pressing on the brake or excelerator there is a clicking sound. The seat warmer/colder system is a little noisy."
It has great acceleration and it looks fantastic.
I am very happy with the vehicle.
The sleek good looking design and the pick up power.  Everything is conveniently located and I look the WIFI internet feature.
Make sure customer does not face any trouble with-in the first week usage of a new vehicle.
nice vehicle with many good technological features.
I am continuing to learn my new car. I have not found any issues at this time.   Love love my car so far. Second Nissan I have own. Great cars.
The Comfort and room.  Handles well
Removing some of the automatic movement of parts that is not necessary or unsafe.
Great ride and safety features.
Better gas mileage would be great.
The drive is very smooth and handles well in all weather conditions.
Nothing! I absolutely love my new car!
It maneuvers great and the seats are extremely comfortable!
Handling
I really take pride in my vehicle and am happy with pretty much everything but the carpet & floor mat quality.  This cheapens the look of an otherwise great looking ride.
"Looks great and love the leather seats and high tech ""gadgets""."
I would like i there was more than 1 usb port in the back seat.  It would be nice to have an alert when driving at night if the headlights were off.  The interior lights are on but the head lights could be off and you think they are on when they are not.
How it drives smoothly. It is a beautiful comfortable car.Love the safety features.
The alarm sound is too loud.  Could be quieter and still accomplish the same thing.
Fuel economy
I like everything so far
Better gas mileage.
"Pretty much everything! The look, the ride, the comfort, and all the extras!!"
"wish it came with a longer warranty, that I did not have to pay for additionally to the price of the car, would have been better to build it in and just charge more for the car, looks like you may have some concern about how the car will hold up?????"
"drive ability, comfort, handling, attractive styling, color"
"The dealer could have been truthful about the actual mileage on the vehicle at the time of the sale.  I was told there was 5 miles on my vehicle when in  realality there was 1500.  The dealer was Naples Nissan of Naples, Fl."
The size
Vehicle does not seem as good as test drive
Looks
"Some of the exterior parts, I've had to snap back into place. I'm wondering how they will hold up in time. Will the plastic chrome ascents hold up over time. Other than that, I think I have a pretty good looking & running vehicle."
The ride! Runs smooth & feel safe when driving it.
I love my new murano and can't think of anything that needs to be improved at this time.
"I chose the style because of the way it looks...sleek and sexy. I love the smooth ride, the easy and strong acceleration, and the quality of the way it is built ie, no interior noise, rattles, etc. Steering is smooth and precise. What more can I say?"
"Nothing, my car is perfect. It has been my dream car for a very long time. I often feel like I'm still dreaming."
"I love everything about it, there is nothing I would change. I guess I would have to say it makes me feel special."
The keyless entry and cameras.
Add back up and front sensor technology.
Looks.
"Two points. 1) I am a bit disappointed in the gas mileage. It is on the very low range of the posted expected mpg. Would be more pleased with the gas mileage if it was more towards the middle of the posted range. I believe that range is 21-28 and I get that driving habits and driving conditions all impact the results, but I do not believe the mpg would ever come anywhere close to the higher limits of the posted range. 2) The only other vehicle feature I believe should be included on the SV model is a trunk release  from inside the vehicle."
"Space, ride, acceleration, interior comfort."
I Think so.
I like the way it Drive and Looks.
This a pretty cool interior.  I would have liked a chrome wheel option
Interior is top notch
Prices are absolutely terrible. I spend way to much money on gas will never get a Nissan again.
Nothing at all
Great styling and performance.
"All the safety features, at my age very important.  Seats very comfortable."
Can't think of anything.
the way it looks.
N/a
Roominess & quietness
Nothing I love my new Murano
The ride
"I notice a slight vibration when I drive the Murano.  It seems like it could be coming from the tires but I am not sure.  Delivery of the vehicle was not the best as there were many stickers left on it, film on the headlights etc.  But once that was all taken care of it, it was fine.  I LOVE this vehicle!"
The look....very sharp and sleek.
At this time everything look good
The style of the vehicle
"I love the new 2016 Murano.  It is my second Murano, having purchased a new one in 2009. The gas mileage is better than the 2009 model, but could still be improved.  It is a 6 cylinder engine, which I enjoy for the the power and handling, and I realize that it has limitations on mileage. I am disappointed that the cargo organizer is no longer integrated into the trunk as in the 2009 model. It was only available on the Pathfinder.  I used this every day and I am not happy that it was not put into this model. I had to purchase a cargo net to keep groceries from sliding all over. I also had to purchase a Weather tech cargo liner to protect the carpet.  My 2009 came with a protector."
"Interior design and color. I have the beige interior and it is beautiful. Convenience of blue tooth, heated and cooled leather seats, sound system. Heated steering wheel is a big plus in the winter months!!"
I would like to have the option to put 18 or 19inch wheels on the platinum model instead of the 20 inch wheels for a smoother ride.
The feel of the vehicle.
"Steering is kind of vague. No direct response to steering maneuver. Self-correcting steering (meaning returning to ""neutral"" or straight forward position after a turn is not what I prefer or am used to)."
"Engine, luxury for a base model, engine performance and above all the seats"
"overall styling, high end interior materials and appearance, and comfort. Peppy performance with great handling and braking. Seems almost perfect for our taste."
The ride could be alittle  better and let in less tire nosie.
Feels like a quality product looks good to me.
It would be nice to have a cell phone charger in the backseat.  An outlet besides the USB.
It is just overall awesome!
Need more time of ownership
Just a very good car
"4 wheel drive, comfort, quietness, powered liftgate, powered back seats, expanded moonroof."
better gas mileage
"safety features, navigation system, smooth ride"
The ride and looks.
very sporty
Nothing :)
The exterior and interior
"Prior to the Murano I drove a 2009 Maxima.  The steering on the Murano feels loose compared to the Maxima.  Just doesn't feel as if I'm in complete control like I did in the Maxima.  Wicked blind spot on the drivers side, thankfully my Murano warns me that a car is in the blind spot."
"Very smooth ride, and very quiet interior.   Love the back hatchback design, easy to put groceries in and easy to take them out, no bending over or reaching far into a trunk."
I wish there was a little more rear storage room/sq. footage. I also wish the visibility out the rear window was better.
"I love my new vehicle - it is beautiful, comfortable, fun to drive, and it makes me happy every time I get in it."
Safety features comfort and styling
I love my  car
The bells and whistles
"When navigation system is on, it would be nice if the screen defaulted back to  the map after a period of not being used. Example: you change the radio station then after 10 seconds or so it goes back to the map."
"Th interface between the Navigation screen and the dash display ( between the tach and speedometer) is excellent. Comfort features heated seats , roominess etc"
"don't know, 2nd Murano, really like them"
"overall handling, comfort, utility"
How it fits a small person.
Nothing it's perfect
"The interior look is phenomenal, the technology is amazing"
"Sight lines are limited in front; difficult to see over hood at times to tell how close you are to obstructions.  Console controls do not work when car is in reverse gear.  Overall, I'm very happy with the vehicle."
Very comfortable ride and excellent handling.  Comfortable seats with lots of flexibility in adjustment.  Nice styling and appearance.
"Increase storage space (doors, rear compartment)."
"Appearance ,technology,"
I like the overall look of the vehicle and I like the colors I wish there were more options on the interior for the Silver Platinum Look. I do think that the bat the aerodynamics of the back since we live on a dust Road the dust seems to really collect on the back window and the back of the vehicle and I don't know if it's due to the aerodynamics of it but we didn't have that problem on other vehicles and living on the dirt road it seems the windshield back there is constantly covered in dust
I like the color and the look of the styling
"There seems to be a few more blind spots in this vehicle that I've gotten used to, but fortunately the blind spot indicators help overcome this! I've also seen some paint imperfections on the edges of my trunk and hood in small areas that fortunately can't be seen from the outside of the car. Wish the gas mileage was better around town...doesn't quite make the advertised 22mpg around town."
"The quiet, smooth ride and super comfy seats as well as the sharp look of the overall exterior!"
stereo and looks
"Will be able to answer this after I see what will be done about the 2 long knife scratches and the windshield bubbles.  I would think this would be covered by warranty of just plain old good ""customer service""  Will see."
Appearance  Fuel economy  Affordable  accessories
comfort and tech features
Added features makes it pricey what I paid I could have got a luxury vehicle with a smoother ride or maybe I should have tried a different model. Hate dealing with dealership too many add on.
First Crossover or SUV still trying to figure out if I prefer it over a sudan.
Get the alignment corrected so it doesn't continue to be a bother
Exterior
better to have blind spot in sv model too
exterior
"the AC and Heater blower I don't feel is that good, I have only used in winter and so far ok but I am kind of worried about texas hot summers and not having enough blowing power!"
"quietness and color, classy looking"
Murano has been outstanding.
Size

Fix the wind noise for me.
Gorgeous and comfortable car
I'm satisfied but some time when I got to break suddenly I feel I got to apply more pressure and it drifts to left slightly.
Love the fuel economy and the navigation for my style of car
Nothing I like what I have.
The overall handling on snow covered roads.
Better mileage
"Solid, comfortable and a beautiful interior"
"I don't know what can be done with the fuel economy but I'm glad that it takes regular gasoline. It would be nice if the exterior noise could be minimized, especially when the panoramic sunshade if open."
"It's difficult to say what I like most because there are so many things I like about it. Overall, I love the style of the Nissan Murano - the exterior is sleek and beautiful; the interior is stylish and comfortable."
My only complaint is with the center console storage where the lid doesn't go all the way upright making it awkward to easily reach in with my right hand.
The technical features are superb
Comfort
Everything
It's looks
Provide quality tires and make sure rear door hatch operates correctly.
It's appearance both interior and exterior.
no improvement - love the Murano
Like the style of the car.
Fix it or replace it
I am very surprised that it does not get good gas mileage and the tank is not very large.  Drive only around town and have to fill up once a week.
Like the looks of the vehicle

"This is our 3rd Murano, we enjoy the vehicle. Roomy, nimble, economical, reliable"
"Need more, cups holder for the back seat passengers and audio systems needs to be a little more special."
Smooth riding and comfortable seat.
Handle grips on passenger seat should be placed lower instead of right above head.

Comfort and quiet
Beautiful exterior and very comfortable seats.
Tinted window   Apple device compatibility
Style and handling
"Not much can be done to improve, I'm very happy with the purchase as it's my second Murano. I am disappointed that the seat adjuster broke so easily and so early. I take very good care of my vehicles so it's an annoyance."
"I really like the interior from the seats to the hard surfaces, very nice."
roominess and power
"Phone Bluetooth functionality is not as stellar as I hoped for. Speaker volume increases or decreases while holding a conversation making it hard to understand the caller. I can only compare to Mercedes Benz phone speaker/mic technology from 2011. Honestly, I expected better considering all other in vehicle functions are stellar. But the phone technology a bit sub par and might sway future purchases since this option is critical for me."
"Touch screen technology, large screen. Very easy to use."
Love it!
All of it
The navigation system is awesome!!
Handling is superb. The ride is smooth. The car is very comfortable.
"The mpg on the window sticker is an outright deception. My vehicle barely gets the in-town mpg when driving on the highway. I traded a 2014 Murano for a 2016 murano in part because of the proclaimed better gas milage only to find out that this one gets worse gas milage than my old one. Murano owners should consider a class action law suit because we've been deceived.  Overall, I've owned 4 Murano and while the appearance of the 2016 is nicer than that of of my 2007, 2009, 2014, the material workmanship and quality continues to decrease. Additionally, I'm getting less and less for my money out of Nissan. It's a shame because I've been a loyal Nissan customer for a very long time. GivenY experience with the delivery of this vehicle and the vehicle itself, I will likely consider other manufacturers in the future."
The styling and the ride.
Nothing!  I love it.
Cameras
Appearance in and out. Roominess. Classy looking. Handles nicely now. Technology
Ease of driving experience.  Handles great.
Find the software problem that is affecting the phone loudness.  I need to mention the retractable cargo cover.  The new design seems very flimsy when compared to the cargo cover I had in my 2009 Murano.  It seems cheap and inappropriate for such a nice car.  I am also not sure it will stand up to the same level of use I was able to get from the one in my previous Murano.
I like the new look and the improved safety features in the Platinum model.
The way it drives
"Accelerator is a little stiff, but it will likely loosen up a bit."
Quiet ride.
I would like to get the issue with Road Noise and Wind noise resolved  Another amenity yuan king missed and that I believe this car should have and it does not s the sensors built in the rear bumper when you are backing up   Even though you have ear view cameras you cannot calculate how close you are to the sidewalk./ wall or any other structure that you are backing against . My previous two cars had this feature and it was very helpful to avoid hitting any structures
"Design, interior comfort and amenities such as AC / Heated seats, NAVi and stereo system and handling overall"
"I LOVE my Murano!  These are quibbles, some I did not expect with the top-end of the model.  I also have speaker issues (sound level) when using the hands free phone.  I think the best think is to make it very clear to the potential buyer what each level of the Murano will offer in terms of apps- without having to dig through backpages, small print or community message board help."
"I love the center stack, the seats, the overall look inside and out, the storage was a pleasant surprise, the backup camera system and all the safety features.  The cruise control assist feature is incredible- I travel for work and love this feature so much.    I LOVE my Murano!  I am answering this as a very satisfied customer that is trying to truly give you fine details that could (should?) be worked on."
"dealer lied to me during purchase and do not intend to buy from that dealer in the future, rquested meeting with owner but call was never returned."

Arm rest is kind of low in the front seat

"The look, the fun of driving, the overall experience."
The ride and looks
Make the technology better. we have a Jeep Cherokee and the technology is much better. It is also a quieter ride than the Murano.
I love the looks and how it drives.
"Because of the small back window, there are blind spots.   When turning left onto a divided street, I can't see the median because of the mirror."
"It is a quiet, smooth ride with good gas mileage."
"The look, driving, room, storage is great"
Nothing very happy with it
roominess  back up camera
"I cannot think of anything, all is great!"
"safety, comfort, style, reliability of Nissan"
Add I-Phones to the voice-to-text and make the electronics easier to follow.
I like the smooth ride.
Everything
The oyster color is very light leather and hard to keep clean.   The chrome on exterior trim is difficult to keep clean and spotless.
Like the sleek vehicle. Heated steering wheel is amazing!!
"We like this vehicle a lot so far but we have 2 concerns.  1. Is the before mentioned Navigation System.  2.  We purchased the wheel lock lug nuts, but were never given a key.  I am worried that if we got a flat tire we'd have a serious problem and be unable to change it roadside.  We've inquired with the dealership and not heard back."
"This vechicle is quiet inside, which is wonderful with my young kiddos.  Road noise is very low, even in the bad grooved concrete roads of Southern California.  The engine is a powerful V6 but yet has good fuel mileage.  We actually like the feel of the CVT tranmission.  The seating is exceptionally comfortable, even for me who has herniated disks in his back."
have wifi inside the vehicle. Everything it great.
"Everything is update Led lights, start button, ect."
Increase fuel economy and range.
Exterior appearance and interior quietness.
"I was told by the dealer we could fit an 8-foot box in the vehicle. This is not true as the vehicle front seats do not fold down at all (being power). This is more a dealer complaint than the vehicle... but we were led to believe it's config for carrying larger boxes etc was greater than it actually is. I want the wind noises and vibrating noises against the windshield addressed, and am waiting until my first oil change."
Exterior styling. The seat comfort. Push to start.
"I had a 2014 Rogue prior to this Murano.  The rear storage system was great.  I could pop up the small rear panel to create a storage space for things like groceries and small packages.  I could also store smaller items under it and hide them from view.  I could slide up the larger forward panel to create a package tray, or leave it down.  The Murano should have something similar.  It has nothing.  That's a big miss."
"The traction control system works great in the snow.  I've got studded tires and have been able to get around with no problem in 6"" of snow, even climbing steep incline hills."
Acceleration when climbing while in Cruze control. In order to accelerate comfortably I have to take it out of cruise. Maybe I am doing something wrong but seems like there should be more power when climbing hills on the freeway.
"Everything. I owned a Rogue before that was well appointed with all available features, very nice upgrade to the Murano. Very sharp looking vehicle."
Not release a vehicle with Manufacturing defects and where Parts for issues do not exist so folks at the dealer can repair it.  It took over 30 days to get the vehicle repaired and it was only fixed by taking the same part off another new vehicle since parts were not available for another 30 days which would have put me at 60 days without my new vehicle.

Love this vehicle !
"Design, comfort,"
"For the first time in 25 years I don't have a key to pop the trunk, or a button inside the vehicle to open it either.  That would be great!"
"The car rides great, looks very nice and gets pretty decent gas mileage.  I'm very happy with it overall."

"decent front seat roominess, decent gas mileage. Hopefully, as dependable as my 2009 Murano was"
Love the car except for the fact that the dash display light goes off.
The ride is very comfortable
Have it so the Navigation tells you the estimated arrival time and then to have Nissan Connect work w my vehicle for my iPhone.

Listed MPG is estimated 21-28....regularly getting under 21 with a mix if highway and city driving
Looks Great...very comfortable and handles well

Larger back space in the cargo Area
The LOOK
Don't feel much cooling from the driver's seat when hot outside. Think the view from the driver forward is slightly obstructed by upsweep in hood.
I like the red color and the beige interior.  Would have preferred the beige be carried further in trim rather than dark gray.
"Roomy, the ride, sound system"
COULD HAVE BEEN CLEAN AND CHECK OVER BEEFORE DELIVERY. NOISE SOUND LIKE WIND FROM TOP OF VEHICLE WHILE DRIVING.
"RIDE, COLOR,"
"I am a large person. If the driver's seat gave me one more inch, it would be great."
"Outside of previous mentions, everything."
"More horsepower or offer a another engine style,  20 inch rims look great a little bumpy and 20 inch rims with a larger tire diam."
Great looks and great for road trips very comfortable

The way it drives and handles
The front window on each side there are blind spots. The corner bars like that are on each side of the window shield that hold it in place. They are thick and you have a hard time looking around the corner.
I like the look on the inside and outside of the Murano.
"It's not the vehicle, it's the service!"

Had a scratch on the inside of the driver's side door
Comfort

Luxury feel
"The car is really beautiful with the new design but I feel that it is not the same quality as the 2012.  I had a 2012 and it was different in driving ability.  It drove much smoother than this vehicle.  It felt like a 6-cyclinder whereas, this vehicle has the feel and startup as a 4-cyclinder.  I believe that the 2012 got better mileage.  Some of the new inside appearance are not consumer friendly.  There are some things that I still am looking for.  For example, the mileage guage, how to use the maintenance guide in the car, like the air pressure in the tires and like I stated the maintenance oil"
Overall the vehicle is very eye appealing.
Back rear side windows are so small it is difficult to see without using the back up camera. The Navi system is difficult to name and save locations.
The bright white color and the heated leather seats.
Make transmission and interior quieter. Improve fuel economy.
Exterior and interior appearance.
The garage opener on the mirror is awkward. Would be better if not such a reach to get
"The look, the feel as I drive it and the fuel economy"
I like everything.
"The moonroof needs to be easier to open and close. The button is very sensitive. The roof will open when when trying to open the shade only.     Also, the car should have faster pick up speed.   A wheel cap came off just 2 months after I got it."
It's looks
FIX THE TRANSMISSION ISSUES!!!
"THE WAY THE SEATS FIT YOUR BOTTOM, OVERALL HIGHWAY DRIVING,LOOKS OF THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR. THE ROOM IT HAS."
Road noise could be better - air/heat is quite loud when on higher levels - Bumpers seems to scratch easily.
"Love the look, very comfortable and roomy!"
I can't think of a thing!
"Obviously, the exterior is head-turning as have been all of my Muranos (this is number 4 for me)! The interior is extremely comfortable, perhaps even more than my previous models have been. And I LOVE the ambient points of light. They had such an elegant touch besides being incredibly functional."
"Improve on gas mileage. I know that I bought a V6 AWD vehicle which is going to use more gas than per say just a rear wheel drive 4 cylinder vehicle, but at best I get a daily average of 21 MPG. This has got to be improved somehow. Loving everything else from the look to the drive."
"The visual aesthetics of the vehicle, drive and much of the features in it."
"We purchased the vehicle, in part, due to the advertised fuel economy.  The actual economy has been approximately 8 mpg less than advertise with modest driving.  Totally unacceptable and a possible deal breaker in the future."
Style
My third Murano and I am pleased with it
Comfort and looks
"Aim for better sitting posture with ability to sit with legs/thighs at right angles, and enough head room or space between my head and the roof/ceiling with my seat at the highest position.  Make it easier to interpret/understand/comprehend the around-view monitor.  Forward/backward adjustments for head restraints.  Warmer seats while car is idling or remotely warming up so I sit on warm seats when entering Murano in cold winter weather.  Have less obstructed views in the front and rear sides of the vehicles.  Don't have the seats angled on the sides. They press into my left thigh. (I'm a thin/average person.)  The metal portion on the steering wheel has rough edges; make that outer edge smooth or tapered so it doesn't cut/scrape a person's hand.  Have adjustable arm rests that can be placed close to the person. (My physical therapist says I should be using a chair with arm rests.)"
"I like the unique design and color (Pacific Sunset), different shape/design/look than the typical look of the other SUVs; the others look similar, but Murano has its unique design with its windows, etc. I also like the unique color of Pacific Sunset, just the right shade/tint; I see other similar colors but they're not quite right or I don't like them. I also like the interior design/colors with cashmere leather. In test-driving and comparing the Murano with other SUVs before making a purchase, the Murano seemed quieter and smoother than others. With my hearing impairment, it's important to me to have a ""quiet"" vehicle so I can hear my passenger better. I also like the Around View feature with the SL trim; it would have cost me much more if I got it in another SUV. I also like the luxurious look/feel of the Murano."
"Provide a storage tray in the rear compartment such as with the 2007 model. Utilize the space under the rear seats for storage. Door pockets are too small. The eyeglass holder is too small. Have an option for a turbocharger or supercharger. Have an option for an upgrade to the sound system (surround sound, mega bass, more power). Colored interior accent lighting."
Very sleek and sexy looking. Love the intelligent cruise and other driver assistance features. Very comfortable.
None. I love my Nissan Murano!
It looks sleek inside and out but is also comfortable and perfect for our family.
Somewhat noisy when on the highway at higher speeds.
It is well thought out and full of unexpected details.  Great value for the money compared to other similar SUV's.
I wish the gas tank was larger to reduce fill-ups.
"Pretty much everything.  My sales person was really exceptional.  Joshua Martinez in Bloomington, Illinois."
The handling
The body style and comfort.
"Appearance, Technology"
I would like to have the text message feature for IPhones.
The body style  Stereo system   Moon roof  All the bells and whistles!!!
"The suspension is rougher than my 2013 Murano.  The wind guard on the moonroof is better than the 2013.  I wish it had the rqin-sensing wipers that my 2013 had.   Same trim package, so I was surprised that it didn't have this feature."
I love how it looks.  Gets better gas mileage than my 2013 Murano.
Nothing.
How comfortable it is to ride in.
I absolutely love my new Murano.  The quality is outstanding and I could not be more pleased with it.
"QUALITY. I thought my 2014 Murano was a very high quality car, but Nissan out-performed itself with the 2016 Murano.  Keep up the good work!"
no improvements needed
everything
"I really like my new car.  If I would change anything, I would improve the lock on the liftgate, work on better temperature control with heating system and reconsider the choice of material for the seats."
"It drive very well.  I really like the additional room for my family from my last vehicle.  The overall appearance of the exterior, interior and design is beautiful.  I have had many compliments."
Gas mileage could be better.
The exterior.
"There are minor things that I don't like - the glove compartment and console storage are next to useless. Door storage is inadequate. One annoying thing is the sound of the automatic locks - it is a jolt every time. As a car, motor, transmission, needed accessories like windshield wipers, I am pleased"
See previous
I'm very satisfied with purchase my car!!!!!
A comfortable and dynamic.
Looks
"Powerful,  nice appearance, roomy, nice technology"
Design and technology
"Look, feel, style, height of vehicle"
Too little leg room for the 5th passenger.
Engine and noise level.
The only thing it may be lacking is Navigation
"Comfort, size, cargo and trunk space, aerodynamic, good gas mileage"
Nothing. I am happy with my purchase.
The reliability of the vehicle.
Better gas mileage.
I like everything!
"Just minor things, foot area on driver side could be warmer. I'd like to be able to have Pandora as an app. Might have to ask the dealer if Pandora can be added when I have my oil changed. I do Love my Murano though!"
"Handling, stability, great in snow"
"I would have liked a bumper strip along the edge of the door as my new Murano al ready has 3/4 scratches on the door from other car doors hitting it. Now l have to worry about the cost and matching of the paint to get it repaired. ?? A simple bumper strip would have prevented that.  Also I would have like more cargo space, because l own a cleaning business. I was going to purchase a Pathfinder for the cargo space, but the Murano is so much more attractive looking on the interior. I didn't like the cloth seats on the Pathfinder, looked cheap, like a woven basket. So l guess I'll stay with the Murano even though the Pathfinder has a little more leg room and cargo space."
"Driving it is awesome, the power and brakes everything spot on. Love the front panel, appears to have all the bells n whistles, that we all love."
Fuel economy could be a bit better but aside from that I love my Murano. This is my 3rd one & so far my favorite
everything
none
the ride
All ok
"A beautiful vehicle, very comfortable, rides nice."
Everything
The vehicle is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned & I get a new car every 1 1/2 to 2 years.  My husband & I have owned 5 Nissan & have had paint issues with 3 or them so I would suggest improving the paint
The comfort
"Your dealer Lancaster Nissan sold the car as ""New"" even though it had 3K+ miles on it because one of the employees was driving it.  They would not replace the tires or brakes which are at least 10% worn.  They did not reveal the mileage until after I wrote the check and was signing the final paperwork.  I question the ethics of what they did."
"Nice car, good performance and handling, comfortable and good looking"
drivers seat leather wrinkling prematurely
It has great fuel economy.
gas mileage
easy to drive
Get the front passenger seat to recline all the time and come back to a upright position when you want it to.
EVERYTHING !!!!
Perfomance
The front seat window shades should have the pullout that was in the 2011 model as it kept the sun out of my eyes.  The black dots on the window in the upper middle portion does not.  That is the only recommendation I have as I love everything else.
Love the front seats so comfortable and the displays on the dashboard.
"1. Upgrade the center console system (Not the speakers)  2. Tuck the driver and passenger seat belt inside the B Coulmn trim, right now it is hanging outside, and any kid sitting in back seat and kicking the seat belt, is causing irritation to the driver, as it is tightening my neck area.  3. Add one more trunk light, to the passenger side, one light isn't helping in organizing the trunk during night."
"Power, Seating comfort, exterior lights, quiet engine, bose audio."
The compartment door right below the cupholder in the gear shaft is hard to open and close maybe a spring missing but the door doesn't function properly and it never has
"I love it not just like it. Exceeds my needs for a car/SUV.  However if I had to choose what I'll most like about my new vehicle, it would be the surprise  spaciousness"
Wind noise decrease and keep sunglasses holder from rattling
"Shocks,, ride,handling,, comfort"
I really love my Nissan Murano there's not a thing I would change in it I just love it. Please know that I'm very happy with it. If I do a trade-in I'll buy another one  or I will purchase another quality made Nissan vehicle. This is my final survey that I will be taking for Nissan. Thank you.
"With a child seat in place, there are not additional cup holders for back seat passengers."
I love the way it drives.
"Nothing, seats are what they are and the mileage is what it is"
rides ok
Nothing at this time....Very satisfied.
Interior space and color. The exterior has a nice sleek style for a mid size SUV.
I like the car a lot besides the squeaky arm rest.  Fyellow economy and acceleration could be better.
"Style, options, room, storage space"
The Nissan connect apps and the fuel mileage
The interior and convenience and safety features.
"Cargo lift door could be more quite. traded a 2009 Murano, that model had a great groceries storage."
The overall handling of the vehicle.
No comment
Intelligent cruise
"I absolutely love my new Murano. And I was very happy when I purchased it. However, as of right now I'm disappointed with some financing related issues that I have encountered. I originally purchased a warranty on the vehicle and then I decided to cancel it the next day. It's been over 2 months now and the amount I paid for the warranty is still not credited to my account. I was told it takes 6-8 weeks from my first car payment which was in the middle of January. Very disappointing."
I love everything about my new vehicle.
the overall style and lines that make up the appearance of the car.  the comfortable ride in the car & the navigation system
Better gas mileage. Back visibility not the best. Overall the car is very sharp.
Very futuristic look love interior.
Appearance  and safety features
Like everything
"I absolutely love my new Murano! My only comparison is to my husband's new Infinity and there are minor difference such as his seating is a little bit more comfortable but, overall I wouldn't trade my Murano for his Infinity :)"
The roominess of it inside ... front and back.
Color and room
Handles very well.
Nothing - we're very pleased with our decision to buy a Murano.
"That's hard to say - possibly the general comfort level.  I drove a Rogue before, and this is a really nice step up in terms of comfort."
Nothing.
The look and interior as well as the technology.
"I like the style, comfort, and ease of using technology."
nothing i absolutely love my new car
"its so easy to handle, the smooth quiet ride"
Rear camera could show the front view especially when trying to park the car. I had it on my Rogue.
"The room and comfort of the interior. I like the provided space in the glove compartment for the manual. SMART!  The Exterior with the chrome highlights is classy,sporty. Very sharp looking car in a parking lot with all the other SUV's."
"Its a ""solid"" ride!  I feel safe in it and it is beautiful !  Would have gotton more options if I could have afforded it"
"I would suggest a rear windshield washer, it gets dirty quickly and in the winter especially it needs a washing solvent."
The zero gravity seats
"Controls on steering wheel are a bit cumbersome, have to look at the steering wheel to find specific controls. Buttons are maybe too small and not so intuitive.  Be nice if you didn't have to turn cruise control on and set distance every time it's started."
Interior is wonderful. Seating is fantastic. Love the exterior look and the engine/transmission. Excellent power and drivability.
AWD
nothing specific to offer
"looks, feel and drivabililty"
"Auto bright headlight dimming, auto windshield wiper activation sensor."
auto braking and intelligent cruise control
The appearance.
"It would be nice if the vehicle could tow a bigger load as compared to vehicles in its class.  With a cvt, I guess that will always be out of the question.  Gas mileage should be much better.  I would think it should average in the upper 20 mpg range."
I like the smooth ride and the ease of the stereo with exception of the steering wheel controls.
I love my car.
"Love the interior and ride, and exterior look"
I love my Murano. No changes
Very smooth ride!
Would never get the sun roof again...too much wind noise when closed..why???
"After having a Murano S, in fact two of them, I am in heaven. This Platinum model is the most awesome cat I have had!"
Every thing! Leather! The radio! The front and back cameras are neat !
Exterior & interior appearance.
"An added ECO boost for fuel.  The Rear middle seat belt is an eye soar in the rear view mirror.  It needs to be in the seat.  More storage space in the cargo area, maybe put a full size spare under car and hidden storage where tire currently is."
It drives well and the seats are comfortable.
Fix the nissan connect and bluetooth features
Its nice looking and its acceleration
The body style
"Fix the issue with cell phone connectivity and sound. I've done some research and it seems like this is a known issue, yet when I called the dealership they acted like they had never heard of the issue before!"
Seats
more color option on leather colors
for the money its a good looking car inside and out
"Safety, design and ease of use."
I don't know what could be done I love it love it!
Appearance and driving..
Mileage is less than advertised.
Exterior appearance and technology. Best seats I've ever had in a car.
"Better Fuel Economy. Other than that, it is a great vehicle."
Comfort
Driving it!
"The color of the seat belts, are pea yellow! Ivory leather is beautiful.  Don't like the color of these seat belts.  Everything else is great!  Thank U"
"The new style, the  look with all that chrome"
lower price
is good car but i think that maybe i must choose other brand
We like the way it drives and how comfortable it is as a driver and a passenger. We feel safe as we drive and ride in it. No complaints!
The visors do not have extensions!!!   Seats for the model I chose are not heated  The middle console waste storage space
"It's OK, I still miss my Maxima!!!!"
If the hot air will start faster and the level of the feet will dispense more hot air.
how smooth it drives and the comfortable of the seats.
Rear parking sensors should be added.
Around view
Absolutely nothing!!! I love it!!!
All of the technology
"I really like the vehicle and my exceptions are truly minor.  I would enjoy having the center console a little further forward to facilitate access, the sunglasses holder to be a little deeper, and so far the navigation system has only failed once.  However, I have only had the car 2 1/2 months."
"I love the 4 camera display showing the vehicle in relation to it's surroundings. I use it constantly in parking.   I like the blind spot warning system.  I really like it's looks.  I like the keyless entry.  Mileage could be better but is satisfactory considering the size of the vehicle.  Overall very pleased, no buyers remorse."
Comfortable.  Fairly high-tech.
I would have the back seats more more moveable. Slant back.
It is comfortable quiet and classie looking
"The only thing that I don't like is the sound system. I expected to be wowed with Bose speakers but instead, I've been hunting for a setting that is preventing any real volume."
It's very comfortable.
"styling, color, technology"
"better wipers, the app setup on the dash is difficult to understand, the nissanconnect on the phone is difficult to understand, heated steering wheel, right side camera when changing lanes.two usb ports in the front dash"
"Ride, seat comfort, roominess, styling,"
"Post on windshield blocks view. Probably, nothing can be done about it."
Comfort and transmission
"In addition to the appearance, the ride and handling is very good."
"Radio appears to be less than great.  Frequently sounds like radio is in a tin can with a metallic echo.  Then it corrects itself, then happens again, then corrects itself. Not what I would expect for a car at this price point.     Dash board warning light indicating that front collision is close constantly comes on and stays on even if no car infront for miles."
"Comfortable ride, roominess of compartments and back storage.  Almost there with gas mileage."
Remote start
"Seems like you cheapen up the new body style. the 2016 is missing options we had in the 2014. We wish we kept the 2014 we liked that car better,"
Its a Nissan!
Lift Gate needs to raise fully and Blue tooth needs to stay connected
Appearance and handling
"Well i dont know where to start check engine light keeps coming on. I took it to Koppel Nissan they took the car did the inspection  and didn't resolve the problem, the just reset the computer, then they told me it's not their responsibility to fix the problem and that I should take the car to Great Neck Nissan where I bought it from.  So I took it there and waisted 3 hrs and nothing was fixed they couldn't fix the problem apparently theu.couldnt diognose the problem they said come back when check engine comes back. Also please tell your dealerships to stop lying to their customers before they buy car from them not to promise loaners, both times I took the car there was no loaners available .I use to own a BMW for 10 years never had a check engine light on, each time I took it to service they gave a loaner. Can't wait till my lease is over going back to BMW or Mercedes"
Nothing
Better MPG
The way it drives
"Space inside.  Power, especially in poor weather conditions."
Replace burned out light.
"Appearance, technology, gas mileage"
The comfortability and shape
I have liked the new look of Nissan Murano.
nothing
Driver needs more leg room. The bases of the seats need to be longer
The smooth ride and the overall look
I like it very much and so does the rat of my family. I bought this product because of the service the Sentara I bought from your dealership is still giving me great service.
I like the complete car very much.
Turning radius could be improved.  Vehicle is hard to turn into tight parking spaces.
"Technology, comfort of interior and driving.  Smooth ride."
MAKE A LITTLE QUIETER FROM OUTSIDE AIR FLOW.
"RIDES, DRIVES AND HANDLES BETTER THAN MY PREVIOUS VEHICLE (PATHFINDER)"
I love be my Platium Murano
Everything
Interior noise could be less. Fuel tank could be larger.
"Style, and interior room"
The fog lights are a joke. They're so dim its hard to tell if they are on.
"I like it because its new and shiney, it handles well, and it has good acceleration."
"Better carpet, better connectivity, still wondering about the transmission."
The ride and engine.
I would like a softer ride over bumps.    I would prefer a quieter interior while driving
I like the looks and feel of car while driving.
"Feel it could use more inside storage, door storage tosmall for map backup.storage around rear interal of vehicle."
Features and safety items such as blind spot. GPS EASY TO OPERATE.
Make it more fuel efficent. Try to fix the moon roof
Power it has and just a good comfortable ride
Would like a little bit nicer center council and a little bit bigger gas tank
Looks lay out of dash nav is easy to use nice ride low road noise and it drives very nice
Should be good after sunroof cover is fixed. Otherwise no place to put my purse for easy access and no place for easy access grabage bag. Still getting used to a different vehicle
Hold the road well in snow storm
"Very good appearance, rides comfortable, handles great."
"i would like to see more customizable features with the radio, i owned a Honda pilot before and liked that i could customize the radio with pictures of my family. an internal hard drive would be nice to store my music instead of having to keep cds in the car that i don't have on my phone. a cheaper dvd solution for the lower model cars would also be nice."
"the seats, they are very comfortable on long car rides."
Very Comfortable Ride and Love this vehicle
Put wifi in the vehicle
Handling
Lighted homelink buttons.  It's difficult to see around the post at the front of the front door windows on each side of the front window.
"The comfort of the seats. Quiet, comfortable ride."
I am fine with the vehicle.
the seats - they are very comfortable.
safety for our child
I have purchased around 30 vehicles and this is by far my favorite
Overall EVERYTHING
Have had some trouble learning the adjustment of heat and air. We are both cold natured.
Comfortable ride.
Safety features
At my first oil changes i would have to have rubber around the door fixed.  I don't think it would be unreasonable to have my door ding fixed.  I would like them to check over the other problems to make sure they are fitting and responding appropriately.
Comfortable seats and drive.  Overall appearance of the Vehicle. Camera Technology.
We like it very much
I am disappointed in the navigation system and that you do not offer Android or Apple auto.   The navigation speech system is behind the times.
interior room and looks
The silver plastic around the air vents on the dash reflect in the window and cause problems viewing cars behind me in the outside mirrors. There are a lot of blind spots. Some of the plastic on the sides could have been more window area. I feel like I have to stand on my head to reach the lever to open the door to the gas tank. Overall I love my new Murano but I thought I should mention these small annoyances.
The comfortable seats! They seem to wrap around me. The inside is spacious. It is very sleek looking. Right up there with luxury brands.
Nothing it is perfect
Roominess inside and very comfortable
I don't feel like the driver seat fits me very well.  I feel like I'm sitting off center.  My only other issue is the middle seat belt for the back seat.  I didn't realize when I bought it but it comes from the ceiling.  Makes it very difficult with grandkids and car seats.
"I love the keyless feature as well as the remote start.  Actually, I love most everything about my car with the exception of those 2 items."
Visibility out of the back and back/side windows could be improved.
"Love how it looks, how it drives, and comfort of seats."
Would be great if you could also add the temp controls into the touch screen.
"Blind spot indicators, intelli-cruise, front collision indicator and exterior appearance"
"You could get your shit together with your technology - Random radar failures for no reason in clear weather and bluetooth connection issues with iOS devices are what I've experienced so far. Overall Nissan (and Infiniti for that mattter) make fantastically mechanically-reliable vehicles, but in every case of the past few I've purchased it seems the more money I spend on the high-end features the more I'm frustrated with their reliability and functionality. Redouble your efforts into making your technology as advanced AND reliable and I'll be 100% happy. In the meantime, don't change what you're doing with the mechanical aspects, you do that right!"
"I like the mechanical build of the vehicle, I like the engines (although they're not nearly as fuel efficient as they should be), I like the attention to detail, I like your interior design - keep those people!, and I like your overall fit and finish."
should included with automatic stater
well design
Wish I could have had heated steering wheel and/or rear seats without going to the Plat.model.
"It's comfortable,extremely good in snow,gets good gas mileage....and has super navi system."
I had trouble with the first sales manager because he sold my car after he took the deposit money and held the car.  We were in touch several times and he assured me he was holding the car.   I filed a complaint with NISSAN and the owner of the car dealer ship.  I then got great service.  David was excellent sales person but his boss was a pure jerk.
I love Murano.   This is my third one and these cars are reliable and run very good for years.
Nothing! We love our vehicle
The sleek appearance and the amazing technology
I hate it.  I made a poor decision leasing this car.
nothing
I would not change a thing about my new Murano.  Maybe next time I'll upgrade to power seats and a better stereo. Could have more powerful speakers.
"EVERYTHING! I love the paint color and it's quality, and the interior looks like a much more expensive car. The motor  is outstanding!  Plenty of power. The ""edgy"" styling sets it out among other SUV's. My dream car, I've always wanted one and now that I have one I'm very very very pleased. Turns heads with both the interior design and quality and the exterior paint and styling. I love how it is much wider and has a bigger stance than my Rogue that I traded in. Exceptional vehicle. Good job."
just the wiper system  CONFUSING...   could be somewhat better on  MPG..   Love it .. in general  great car..happy we bought it.. Nothing is perfect.. Just need to figure out the wiper system..
the Ride is great!!! .quiet...just love the design..color..!!!   I would buy another  Murano for sure..  nothing is so wrong that is upsets me all that much.. We will figure out the wiper system...
"Last vehicle we had was a  Mercedes gla 250.comfort  was terrible ,control positioning was horrible, using gps was impossible .this is the third Murano we have owned its fantastic.the people @ Hanover Nissan was outstanding."
I am completely happy with my vehicle!
1. Nothing is wrong with the paint.  Just have to get used to a white car.  2. Wish that body was shorter from front to back. Loved the body type of the 2007 Murano; wish it was still available.
my last car was a 2002 Nissan Altima so I LIKE just about everything with my new car.  Have not found anything yet that is a problem.
I just love it no words can express how much I love this car.
Put a warning noise on the camera when you are backing up.  Was backing up using cameras and no warning that I almost ran into the house.  Hard to judge the cameras backing up
Its an all wheel drive and the interior and sun roof
Liked the seats in my 2006 mutant better.  They were roomier and more comfortable.
Handles great.   Love the blue tooth capabilities.   Heated steering wheel is the best!!  Like all the cameras and warning systems.
"Love it..wouldn't change anything, I tell everyone they need a murono"
"Love everything, safety features!"
I'm very happy with my Murano.
Interior appearance.
"We have  read the manual off and on and this car has so many features it is overwhelming. We need to take the time and come in to dealership with salesman  to go over electronics and radio. We really do like the car. it is smaller than our Ford expedition but love the SUV Murano. The electric memory seats, hatchback etc. We drive it short travels in and around Sebring. Gas mileage is 25 to 28. We bought more for Hybrid. We like how it fits on our carport, the front  camera and all electronic back up features."
"That it is a hybrid. good gas mileage, pretty car.  fits on our carport. adjusts automatically seats and mirrors, camera front and back. We have not seen another one like it in town."
Cruise control drive settings
Husband has trouble pressing excellator. Sometimes it stalls
Beautiful.  Lots of convinces.
Na
Overall look and seat comfort.
"I loved my 2009 Murano and would not have considered any other vehicle.  However, I expected a 2016 version (platinum edition) to have a far superior nav system and made with some better quality materials.  Overall, I love my new Murano, but don't know what to recommend you do (to my vehicle) to change my rating."
"Love the seats, roominess, and tech features (accept for nav system).  I also like the body style better than my 2009 model."
"I found it a little bit noisier inside while driving than my previous 2013 Nissan Altima. NissanConnect is missing apps, and it doesn't allowed to reply texts messages with iPhone 6S."
Seats are comfortable. Like the new interior and exterior design.
Everthing
Volume could go a little higher.  Could be a little quieter. ..but great car and dealership
Size and a lot less than an infinity
"I use to work at a Nissan dealership from 2005-2007. The plastic that covers components on the under body was missing from many of the vehicles that I would service. I assumed that Nissan had fixed this problem when I purchased my 2012 Altima. It seems easy to fix - use stronger retaining clips? Now I have the same problem with my 2016 Murano, REALLY? 43k dollars and the plastic didn't even hold on until the engine was broke in?"
Driver aides are more practical than I thought they would be.
Value
"Fuel efficiency, road noise"
The safety features and comfortable ride
It is a beautiful vehicle but in the inside it has three colors dashboard brown like a cream color inside and carpet is great when it should be brown  like the dashboard color and I love leather don't like fabric seats this one has that it is a beautiful car but it uses too much fuel and the chip on top paint coming off  hope paint doesn't keep coming off on that part but I will take it in this week
Like the size like the way drives except for  uses too much fuel love the color and will love it better if it had leather all inside and just two colors but it's a very nice vehicleuses too much feel well I guess that's all for now we hope thank you
"Styling ,gas mileage,comfort"
Seat and the way body shape is
Fix navigation and sound issues.
"Love the seats (except for the material). Very comfortable.  Love smart key, blind spot detection, power lift gate, back up camera, other safety features."
i always loved murano
the comfort and safety features
Nothing at all I love my Nissan Murano
Everything
I love the look of it and the comfort inside
More plastic in use both inside and out. I have a 2009 Murano and the interior is more solidly built than the 2016. Don't know if the interior will hold up as well as the 09 has.
The electronics are the best thing I like about this car. Plus it has the latest safety devices. Car handles very well.
very good drove
"although vehicle looks great aesthetically I feel it may be built a little ""cheap""."
Designed well. Looks great inside and out. Electronic features are good as well
Overall noisy and could improve gas mileage slightly
Reliability and overall comfort
Nothing to comment.
"The Smell (LOL), seriously it is a great car."
"Combined looks of vehicle with 20"" wheels."
The design
All is perfect
It's perfect !!!
Navigation
I didn't receive a users manual and have asked the dealership twice
Technology.
The comfort of seats
"REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH THE HIGH QUALITY OF THE VEHICLE, BOTH  INSIDE AND OUT. HAVE THE ENGINEERS THINK WHERE RUST MIGHT START OCCURRING. CREVICES, MOLDINGS ETC.  I HAVE BEEN THE PROUD OWNER OF 7 NISSAN VEHICLES DATING BACK TO YOUR INNOVATION OF THE SLIDING DOORS ON THE SMALL NISSAN AXXESS. I HAVE ALSO OWNED YOUR INFINITY J 30.  KEEP IT CONSISTENT NISSAN. I'M YOUR SOLID ENDORSER AND THE BEST, I REPEAT, THE BEST TESTIMONIAL ENDORSER---????"
"SIMPLY STATED, EVERYTHING!!!!!!"
the seats are super comfortable
Fix heated seat issue.
Comfort. Drive. Interior
"I've liked Murano's since 2009 when I drove one in LA. I like the fact that mine has AWD but it's not a SUV. I like the entry height of the seat. I have a bad back and do not like bending down to get into or out of a sedan. I like the color (black) and the chrome accents of the exterior. Although I was leery of the brown interior, my family liked it."
interior
Incorporation of technology with a feel of luxury overall
Good acceleration
I am very happy with it.  It is just that when you buy something brand new; it should be perfect.  New vehicles are a huge investment.  Some of these things are bound to happen. It just creates a frustration for the customer.
I love the look of it.  I have always been told that once I buy Nissan I will never buy anything else.  This is my first Nissan so I hope that is true.
All good now.
quietness and feeling of stability in the vehicle
i would appreciate a service call from dealership to fix all my issues
"It is a very pretty car, nice looking and fast"
Ride and exterior style.
"Comfortable seats, beautiful exterior and I get better gas mileage than with my last vehicle (Infiniti QX56)."
"The delivery of the vehicle had issues. The sales process was very smooth, but the delivery and service department where I purchased the car were very disappointing."
Love the adaptive cruise control and all of the cameras
Maybe better gas mileage.
"How it performs, braking, interior is fantastic."
I am basically satisfied with auto
comfort and basic soundness and safe
All i can say is Miller Nissan of Fairfild Ct is fabulous..   KASHA is the best sales person ever.  That's why I bought my Murano.
Just about everything.
"I love my Murano, it was the only car I wanted and I was very happy that the dealership right across the street from where I live had the exact model I wanted in stock.     My issue is that I purchased it on 1/26/17 from Mt Kisco Nissan in Mt Kisco, NY and one week later the dealership closed. My paperwork has been caught up in legal action and I have spent way too much time trying to get my car officially registered and legal ownership of the car.     A time of purchase the dealership offered me 3 years of maintenance (oil changes and tire rotation). According to Nissan, it is up to the new dealership I go to for service to determine whether or not they will honor this. (1) Nissan should cover this and (2) it should not be up to me to cut deals with a new dealership.    Nissan knew that this dealership was closing, I am sure that there are many moving pieces, but there should have been some indication that anyone who purchased a car during this period would have issues. It would have been nice to have been contacted by Nissan with next steps and how to proceed to legally drive my new car. I learned from a neighbor and spent days trying to piece it together between contacting White Plains Nissan, contacting DMV and Nissan.  Nissan was not able to do much, I had to handle everything with the DMV and have been working with their complaint department and an inspector. Once my paperwork is processed through the DMV, I will also need to pay for my registration again and I have received no indication on when I will be reimbursed.    I did speak with Nissan weeks ago and never received a follow-up call to see if all is OK. That is unacceptable.    I love my car, but I am very unhappy with the way that this situation was handled. This purchase is a big investment and something I worked hard towards.     If you have any questions or need additional information, I can be reached at 914-666-2051.    Donna Cravotta"
The looks and ride
Improve gas mileage
"Appearance, cameras, blind spot indicator, ease of using phone book and navigation"
"I need to find the time to take the car into the dealership to have the noise problem resolved.  Also, the passenger fog light is not working so that needs to be resolved."
I like that it is new and that I have blue tooth for phone calls.  There is a lot of technology in the car.  I had been driving a 2006 Saab 9-5.
Including internal hard drive for radio to store music cd and import MP3 files for listening.  Also paddles on steering wheel for better control.
Comfort of drive
Seatbelt redesign..include all accessories on a platinum purchase (missing cargo cover) and missing crossbar..spent $500 after purchase for the items....more ports in convenient location
Drive smooth.... the space ...the sporty look
"It is really not the dealership's fault, but my Murano has never been detailed.  It was not done the day I was supposed to pick it up due to weather.  It has not been done since.  I have noticed scuffs on a couple of the handles and the back with very minimal use.  I have purchased many autos over the years, but this is my first Nissan.  While I like the vehicle very much, I doubt the dealership will ever detail or correct the scuffs since I took delivery without a detail service.  I will never do that again, and their response will determine if I will purchase Nissan again or not.  While the scuffs take nothing away from the driving dynamics, they and the plastic and stickers that I continually try to remove from the Murano are annoying."
"The seats are fantastic, the power from the drive train is great, and the room for my family is just right."
"Comfort,handling,performance,appearance,sound system,ability to transport people and supplies."
Looks
"The interior colors have grown on me now but why so many? There is far brown, cream, silver, black, gray, a few too many."
Love the space and exterior styling
It is great as it is...
"Ease of driving, exterior looks, interior comfort."
better fuel mileage
"This is my 4th Murano (I have owned a 2005, 2009, 2013 and now a 2016).  Each model has been an improvement over the previous one. I was completely satisfied with my 2013 until an unfortunate accident destroyed it. The fact that both my wife and I walked away from it unharmed is a testimony to the Murano's safety features and quality construction. NIssan has a customer for life!"
"Appearance, quality of workmanship, and fuel efficiency."
"I love the style, boyh interior and exterior.  Very nice ride with a lot of neat technology and safety features."
Apps need to be put back into Nissan Connect. Maps for Nav should be available for free update like my Garmin. Getting lost or hurt by trusting  a gps system  is totally  unacceptable today! Other issues my dealer should be able to fix.
3.5 motor! Exterior looks. Interior looks. Seats are very good. AC blows good & strong. Brakes are strong. Instrument cluster info is good and bery readable. Ride comfort is good.
Quieter interior would be good and better shocks or suspension as it is rough over bumps
Style and interior seats
I love this vehicle. The fuel mileage could be much better!!
Appearance
A little larger fuel tank would be better for long trips
I like the safety features
Style and comfortable
"As I have said in all other surveys I have done for all my previously leased Muranos, my husband and I wish it got better gas mileage/gallon.  This current 2016 may be a little better but I haven't had it all that long to truthfully say it is getting better gas mileage."
"The comfortable, quiet ride"
"i hope i have explained what concerns i have so far with this vehicle.  i do like it, and have been pleased with it for the most part, and i would really be pleased if the mpg would improve and if i didn't get blinded periodically."
"i really like the size of the glove box and i was pleased to find that there is a shelf in there!  it is comfortable, and i am easily able to rest my arm on the center console when  driving.  the steering wheel is comfortable for me.  i did not think i would ;like the back-up camera, but find i really do like it as i get more comfortable using it, though i still use my eyes to look around before i start moving, and,  i like looking/checking at how well i park, either between the lines, or next to a curb.  that is a nice feature."
Like the ease of driving and comfort
Can't think of a thing.
The solid feel when on the road.
Just the wind noise around the mirror at this point.
Roominess
the radio speakers are not just right. open windows will drowned out the music.
"comfortable seating. Outstanding looks both interior and exterior, Every time I see it parked at my home I think wow."
I love the 2016 Nissan Murano Platinum. Very great ride love the quality. Also Rosen Nissan the dealership did an outstanding job. Jeff Rosen was awesome and the sales guy Phil did a great job to thank you
The style the drive in the functionality of the car
Handling
"I am very pleased with my car so far other than the shifting/doggy/no get up and go that I am experiencing with it.  Only other thing that comes to mind is the windows freeze shut VERY easily, which is a bit annoying.  No problem with that on my 2013 Murano."
The overall look of the exterior and interior is very sharp.  Comfort is there as well and also like that it has the additional cup holders in the doors.
Think the battery in the hybrid could be used a little better and a little more.
ride comfort and looks
Nothing
Safety features like the warning when a car or pedestrian is in harms way. I like seeing hands free calling directives on my console screen vs wheel - I can keep my eyes up
Very good car to drive on long trips and around town
"More space, moon roof, different temperature controls for passenger and driver sides!"
No problem
Style and comfort
My dream car! I'm a happy gal!!
Effortless to drive!
Transmission not very smooth. Hesitates when going from reverse to drive since day 1
Roominess
the seats could be a little wider.
It could have a better sound system.
"Looks, performance, comfort"
It rides and handles well.
"Don't put the interior as a sandy or off white color...the color of peoples clothes ends up rubbing off on it and it shows up. Makes me a little paranoid about what people are wearing when they get into the car...even with seat covers on, I'm nervous."
the feel of how it drives and the room it has on the inside. Plus I like the redish color too for the outside!
"Honestly I love my new Murano, but the interior is difficult to keep clean with kids lol"
"Feels luxurious when I drive, comfortable and smooth ride"
better fuel econ.
The features are very nice.
"A couple of days after purchasing, I notified my salesperson and a mgr about scratches on the winshield and drivers side window and there seems to be adhesive or some glue spots probably left from delivery of vehicle. I WAS TOLD IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE TAKEN CARE OF. I have not heard from the dealership. My purchase was 1/31/2017??"
Beautiful
Rethink hybrid with real powerful battery and electric motor plus better transition
"Design,  confort , finishing, panoramic roof..."
I love everything about the car and have no complaints!
"Needs storage for the driver to access. Hybrid should allow for longer times on battery. It gets better gas mileage than most, but not as good as the computer says. The computer is off by at least 2 mpg."
"It looks fantastic. It is very quiet. Its safety features, especially the collision avoidance, are assuring. I feel good in the vehicle, which is probably the most important item. I would make a minor adjustment to the sound system, but it does work well and is easy to use."
"Its comfort, gas mileage"
"Overall, I love the Murano, and if something happened to this one today, I would get another tomorrow. However, I have 3 general complaints:  - I wish the exterior paint had more layers of clear coat. I've never had a vehicle whose exterior scratched or chipped so easily, and my previous vehicle was black too.  - I wish the seat warmers heated up faster. I miss my previous vehicle's seat warmers that were toasting within a minute, which kept me warm while the heater warmed up.  - I wish the engine/transmission could crawl slower in stop-and-go traffic. The ""crawl"" speed (i.e. no pedal interaction) is fairly fast, and I have to hit the brakes often in accident traffic, and it's obnoxious.    Otherwise, I love the Murano."
The overall look and comfort.
"Don't like the way it sounds on acceleration om take off. It sounds like a diesel, not sure if that's the way it supposed to sound, this is my first hybrid."
Absolutely. This is my third Murano.
please add sound to back up and front camera.  so when you get too close to another vehicle or object you can hear a warning beep.
it had the  most comfortable seats in its class
Its a great car.
Room and drive
More space in the back and maybe just a little bigger
Love the looks and feel of the Murano
The only suggestion I may share is increased center console storage and addtional space on open cubbie at back of it.
I like it's ease of functionality. My youngest teen is 'learning to drive' with her permit in my new Murano. And she's a petite 5 ft 95 lb young lady. Even she has commented how easy it is for her to navigate
"Our Nissan Murano gives us Technology, Comfort, excellent handling and drive ability, and in our opinion, one of the best looking cars on the road.  We couldn't be more pleased with our decision to purchase Nissan"
Everything!
There is a small amount off road noise that might need to be improved in the future. We love the Murano and plan to keep it. That is the only con I have noticed.
Pretty much everything but probably the comfort of the seats the most.
my only real concern is that nissians have trouble with the cadililic converters  arond 150000 miles      i keep a car for 10 plus years
comfort
Improved gas mileage. Currently getting 24.9 miles per gallon.
"Technology included with the vehicle to include the navigation, stereo, driver settings - the whole package."
"Not much, as mentioned previously e traded the vehicle."
Vehicle has been traded.
"General comfort, reliability, safety features and gas mileage."
"I don't know, it is pretty much what it is I think.  I really do like the performance of the car.  Sometimes I seem to have trouble judging turns looking over the hood and some trouble judging parking lines and space when parking, but I guess I'll get used to these things.  I am 75 years old and new things aren't as easy as they used to be, but I would like to improve on the wind noise and cockpit arrangement."
Performance
Versatility.
The rear seatbelts cut into your neck. There should be a way to adjust them like in the front.
The comfort!  We just took it on a long trip and the seats are so comfortable!
I love the smoothness of the ride
none
Moreeeee volume??
Everything is gorgeous
I would like to see a sunglasses holder that can accommodate shield style sunglasses.  I would also like a bit more leg room. My spouse is 7 feet tall and has to have the seat all the way back which makes the back seat a little tight. He also needs a bit more head room when getting in the car.
It drives great and looks amazing.
"When I received my Murano SL it was supposed to have a panoramic power sunroof. IT DID NOT! The sales manager ensured me that this would be able to be installed after market and that was NOT TRUE. They were able to install an aftermarket sunroof but it was not the panoramic sunroof I was promised. I was supposed to get the same Factory Panoramic Sunroof as all the other Muranos. Not only did this upset me, it made me question the whole sales process. Now I feel like I am stuck with a vehicle that wasnt presented to me the way I was promised it would be. Before this process I was a champion for Nissan vehicles. When the time comes to purchase a new vehicle I may have to explore other companies."
I like the style and the feel of the vehicle.
I did not have a good experience with the dealership that I purchase the vehicle from  with regards to some of the promises and dealings I went through.
"The interior comfort (seats), instruments and technology."
Love it so far. very comfortable and luxurious
The smooth ride
"We talked to dealership about noise/air leakage.  They suggested we use it awhile and see if it goes away, if not bring it back and they would take care of it."
It drives great!
I bought a new vehicle to avoid issues that arise with an aging vehicle. It's upsetting to have these issues after only 2 months. The service depart had no idea what was wrong with it and took 2 weeks to get it back to me. I'm still not sure what was wrong with it. The service dept was closed when I arrived for pick up. I have yet to return for paperwork. I'm not sure there is anything that can be done.
Over all I really like the Murano. I downsized from an escalade so I like having all of the extras. I love the size of the Murano. It is easier to maneuver and park.
Rear cup holders in doors are too small. If middle seat in rear is occupied the space in the door is too narrow and short for almost any bottle or drink. Rear seat legroom is a little tight. A baby's feet while in a car seat hits rear of driver seat or has to bend legs in order to fit.
Exterior looks and handling are outstanding. Seat comfort is also outstanding compared to several other models in the same price bracket.
Better gas mileage
Exterior design
None.  I plan to have all issues liked at during first oil change
"The appearance, sound system"
I can't think of anything. I absoutely love my Nissian Murano. I have never owned a vehicle this nice. I'm so glad I chose this car.  Thanks again.  Carie Cargile
The look and the interior
Nothing my husband is in love
Drive ability and technology plush interior. Like a real luxury.
Not a thing
"looks, drivability , roominess, Nissan reliability"
storage in door panels is useless. center console not as good as Altima.
everything is great except storage and tranny noise at low speeds..but testing says it is within specs..
"There isn't much I don't like, really loving this car!"
its all good to me!
the comfort
Everything was fine I delivery and experience at the dealer was excellent
The interior
"looks,handling,interior etc."
Has all the bells and whistles and than some.
Nothing
I feel very safe
Nothing.
Safety features and the sound system
A third row would be nice. Or at least a slightly roomier second row
The price.  It had a greet dealer incentive
The brakes at lower speeds grab harder than expected. The transmission or engine  vibrates at 30 to 40 mph until you manually shift the transmission down one position. The rear bumper cover paint does Not match the vehicles paint.
Looks or appearance. All wheel drive. Great acceleration.  Comfortable seats. Camera system.
Nothing we love it
The seats they are so comfortable
Great mileage & beautiful look.
Better fuel economy. City only averaging 17.3 mpg
comfort and appearance
"I feel fine about the vehicle at this time but when I needed it towed and had a new alternator installed after only 2weeks of ownership, I have reliability concerns."
"I like the looks, size, interior technologies, and the smooth ride of the vehicle."
More turning stability.  Smoother ride.
"Comfort, high profile, large cargo area."
Stereo definitely needs to be better. The one in the Juke my grandma got is way better than mine and I got the platinum edition.
The look of the outside
"The only dsappointment is when connecting to Bluetooth playing music from my phone, the sound quality significantly drops. The volume must be turned up high to hear it. I also do not understand why it's necessary to start the vehicle to open or close windows and or listen to the radio."
The luxury!
"If I could get most of the quality issues addressed, I would feel much better about the Murano. Also, I need to get a clear answer on whether or not I can use cross rails with my roof rack on my technology package-equipped Murano."
I just like being in the vehicle and driving it.
Fix the wind noise.
the exterior looks.
Recall procedure for ABS brake system was irritating.  I had to go to the dealership and wait for 1+ hours to be told that the part was not on the recall list.
Style and feels solid/good quality vehicle.
The leather seating takes on color rubbed off from clothing very easily.
"roomy interior, heavy/sturdy feeling drive, navigation features on dash and right in front of driver, large moonroof, button for closing trunk/hatch, sound system, auto cruise control."
More features included with price
Love it!!! It's a perfect family car for 4.
I like
The look is good
"The design of it,  technology, navigation"
"I have 2 design suggestions.  The back window is a collector of dirt.  The design needs to be changed.  After a car wash it is the first place to quickly be dirty again.  Pollen, dust, etc just seems to noticably collect on the rear window.  I own two Nissan Murano Platinum cars (2015 and 2016) and this is a  problem with both.  The second thing going that should be changed is at the base of the driver'side seat  there is a plastic cosmetic trim piece that will scratch or scrape your left leg when you wear shorts.  It is not noticeable if you are wearing long pants.  Have scraped my leg several times when shifting my left leg position.  The piece of plastic sticks   forward too far and the bottom edge of the plastic is sharp.  Again, this is on both of my cars."
"My husband and I LOVE this car, obviously, if we purchased 2 model years back  to back.  Love the edginess of its appearance, the smoothness of the CVT,  the solidness of the body and all of the safety technology.  Will buy another when we are ready!"
"The stero is not High end at all, it plays well, but not exceptional.  The paint especially on the hood, cast shawows from the sun, it looks like something is in front of the vehicle. I would go LESS glossy"
"The Nav, camera, side alerts and hands free communications... all good stuff"
Sunroof controls need work.
Design & interior.
Exterior look
I don't like the speakers being at the top of the car. I like them better when they are on the side of the doors
everything really.
"not one thing.  I had a Nissan Altima before my Murano, and had such a great experience I will continue to be a faithful Nissan customer."
everything!
Style and appearance
Fix paint chips to like new
Appearance
Would love to have robo calls telling my warranty is expiring to stop. Car is only 3 mos old.
Looks and features we looked for available. Very happy so far
Improve Paint Quality
MPG
nothing......
I have had A LOT of vehicles through the years and this by far is my favorite. There isn't anything I would change!
Everything!!
"the posted MPG v. reality is a little off because the only way to get the mileage advertised is to not drive in traffic and drive very slow - which is unrealistic.   Otherwise, I am very happy with the car."
"smooth handling, quiet ride, and the look."
exterior
"Appearance, front seat heights, interior design, gadgets"
Better gas mileage overall is a great SUV
To design the handling the quietness interior
"I don't like how the seatbelts for the rear seat are located in overhead of the vehicle vice attached to the seat. For smaller children sitting in the back middle seat, it makes it extremely difficult to buckle them in securely."
Extremely comfortable and is the best riding vehicle I've ever driven.
Fix the transmission and engine/gas mileage problem
Looks nice and collision protection system is slick
"We like the vehicle, just frustrated with the little things identified. The dealership service was not very efficient in trying to get things resolved."
"Appearance,smooth ride ,comfort and gas mileage."
"Appearance, comfort, and features"
"Some of the placement of button and dials location were hard to activate while keeping eye on road I.e. The back switch is on passage side of screen, with the radio buttons on driver side. But you have a radio / Nav is also on the steering wheel. Nav controls could used a joystick so as not to feel for / look for control while driving...If passage seatbelt is active Nav screen would be active as well..."
"I find the pull loops for the reclining back seat strange. The drivers seat would feel better if I could tip the seat. The front edge cuts into my thighs when I have the seat where I need it. I want that vibration gone. I need to take into the shop. Time issues. And the rear cargo area is strange with the retracting cover. I haven't figured that out yet. Lastly, matt finishes that don't scuff quickly."
Esthetics. Ease of driving. Nice pick up for a larger vehicle. I had a Z. Knowing my Z required little up keep so I have confidence in Nissan. It's nicer than my friends Cayenne and BMW.
The light thendicators for traffic in blind sports should be angled at  45 degrees - thus would make it easier to see the light.
"The ride,  the interior and the rims."
"Smooth ride, engine performance"
The vehicle has a weird smell
The seats
Offer an upgrade to apple CarPlay. Determine a fix for loss of Bluetooth connectivity. Determine what the problem is for transmission lag.
Looks good. Great acceleration.
"External sound is pretty loud, but overall i LOVE LOVE LOVE my Murano.  So happy with my decision over the Audi."
"The way it feels on the road, being female it's not too big or too small to handle.  The storage is OK. The bose sound system is THE BOMB!!! Moonroof is awsome.  I could go on and on."
I like it very much.  Haven't driven it in the show and slush yet so can't say yet  how well it will handle. This was the major reason I purchased the Murano.
"The room for passengers, comfortable seating, ease of driving, and I like the cruse control adjustment that allows the driver to keep car distances.."
I love my new 2016 Nissan Murano hybrid platinum and bought it specifically because it was the only American built hybrid SUV. The only thing that would make it better would be if I could plug it in and use more electric. It has every amenity I can think of except a cell phone charging tray.
The interior is beautiful and I love having a hybrid.
As advertised
Better gas mileage
interior design
I love our new Murano! We may be a Nissan family from here on out. We have been a Toyota and Honda until this one!
Safety features and comfort.
love the side lights warning you not to switch lanes
Fuel economy and ride quality
Remote start
"Have all of your vehicles thoroughly checked before sending them out.  I cannot believe that we purchased a brand new, platinum vehicle with this type of issue.  At this point, I wish we had just driven back to the dealership and told them to keep it, but we don't live in the same city and did not use it very much the first few weeks.  The more we started to use it, the more that it was obvious that it had a major flaw.  This was our first time to buy a Nissan and quite possibly the only time."
Appearance
"You could add a button to open the cargo area, inside driver area or the key fob"
"Everything, this is a really nice vehicle."
We just purchased the Nissan in April and to be honest have not driven the vehicle very much at this point.
"Appearance, safety features, very smooth to drive."
Outside mirrors block your vision during left & right turns
Size and ride
"Technology,  smooth ride, interior design"
"Very pleased with the purchase overall. There have been minor glitches with the eyeglass case, the door scuffs easily and the steering wheel has sharp edges. Gas economy is not as good as prior vehicles. I have still recommended the vehicle to family and friends and would consider purchasing another one."
"Comfortable ride, advanced technology and exterior styling."
"Get with Google's navigation system,  it's always updated. Nissan needs to have updated navigation. ..it sends me the long way to get to a destination."
Everything!  It's like luxury!  I really enjoy it.
Is a good vehicle in its class.
"Handling, luxury and Drivability"
Nothing! I'm very happy.
Spunkiness
Hide the flap in cargo area. When all windows are rolled down it starts flapping around while driving.
"Stereo, sun roof and more power"
"I received only one intelligent key with the delivery,"
"Appearance in and out,  Ride,. quality"
